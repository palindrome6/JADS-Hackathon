http transplantation direct www.transplantationdirect.com . moreover confusion between trafficking for the re moval of organs and trade in organs further complicates the understanding of practices. the council of europe convention on trafficking in human organs adopted in july is an example thereof. more specifically there is a lack of clarity in respect of the legal interpretation of the definition of organ the clas sification of a perpetrator and victim and of the applica tion of their rights and protections and in particular establishing the requisite means underarticle most espe cially with regard to the abuse of a position of vulnerability. a number of other criminal offences that are characteristi cally related to thbor are either not covered by domestic legislation or are not sufficiently identified and investigated by practitioners or both. among both criminal justice and medical practitioners legal and ethical confusion exists in respect of the interface between the oath of medical secrecy in relation of doctor patient confidentiality and the existence of a duty on medi cal practitioners to disclose cases of thbor. recommendations article of the trafficking protocol remains the bench mark definition and criminal justice practitioners should adhere to its primacy especially in respect of the preven tion protection prosecution and partnership ethos con tained within its terms. both legislative and nonlegislative responses are required to improve cross border collaboration in criminal cases. in many instances legislative measures are a precondition for improving the nonlegislative response. further clarification on the circumstances under which a person is considered a perpetrator or victim of thbor is needed. legislators should ensure that a victim centred rights based approach to thbor is consistently applied to the transposition and application of thbor in domestic leg islation in compliance with the international benchmarks and that victims have full access to compensation and res titution remedies. legislators should ensure thbor offences are extra ditable states can claim extraterritorial jurisdiction and predicate for the purposes of assets confiscation. legislators should ensure that the full range of subsidiary criminal offences related to thbor eg buying and sell ing of organs receiving an organ that has been obtained through thbor are fully available to prosecutors pro vided that the sanctions for such related offences are commensurate with the gravity of the crime and that they include access to the same standard of rights and protec tions to the victims as conveyed by the full offence of thbor. based on the empirical evidence of the crucial importance of whistleblowers to the disclosure of thbor legisla tors should ensure that full legal protection is available to those persons that act in such a role. the relevant legal medical actors national european and international transplant organizations medical ethical com mittees world health organization should clearly estab lish a binding rule that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring full legal and ethical compliance of transplant procedures remains with the transplanting surgeon and cannot be delegated. given the prevailing goodwill and preparedness that exists on both sides the appropriate global regional structures copyright the authors. transplantation d within the criminal justice and medical professions should establish a joint technical working group to draft a co operation agreement between both sides that precisely sets out the nature and extent of the duty of doctor patient confidentiality and the conditions under which medical professionals would be obliged to disclose information indicating thbor and the extent and nature of the infor mation that should be disclosed by them to the appropri ate criminal justice authorities. investigation and prosecution challenges it is recognized that thbor is an extremely complex crime to combat but this factor is currently compounded by either a general lack of awareness of the crime among crimi nal justice practitioners or a reluctance to acknowledge the existence of the crime or a lack of political will to combat it and often a combination of all . there is a reluctance to prosecute senior medical pro fessionals and other complicit officials for a crime that is not well understood at any of the investigator prosecutor judiciary levels. the particular modus operandi of thbor results in con siderable confusion among practitioners in terms of the inter pretation of the requisite means used to commit the crime and role of consent. the current response of law enforcement agencies to thbor is almost entirely reactive with little sign of a proac tive multiagency multidisciplinary approach to achieve early disclosure of the crime. where these complex investigations do take place they tend to lack proper multiagency coordination and are under resourced. investigators and prosecutors lack comprehen sive specialized and case based guidance on how to build and prosecute these cases and there is no specialist training provided to assist them in the task. recommendations proactive approach law enforcement agencies should take the lead in developing a coordinated multiagency pro active approach to detecting thbor and this should include the development and application of thbor specific indicators as an integral part of programmatic proactive monitoring of relevant sectors. existing multiagency thb networks should be strength ened and develop an increased focus onthbor.relevant actors especially criminal justice and medical networks should appoint specific thbor focal points within their structures to facilitate and build more effective informa tion sharing partnerships. in common with current requirements for customs decla rations and such like legislators and immigration border police agencies should create a legal requirement for all persons entering or departing the territory of the state or the european union to declare the fact if they are travel ling for transplant purposes. thismeasure intends to work on levels it provides the authorities with increased capacity to monitor such movement and can act as a dis incentive for travelling recipients and make the modus operandi more problematical for the traffickers. investigation and prosecution legislators and other rele vant authorities should provide clear guidance to inves tigators and prosecutors on the interpretation of the irect. published by wolters kluwer health inc. wolters kluwer holmes et al means of a position of vulnerability and the role of consent in thbor cases in line with the recent guid ance papers issued by united nations office on drugs and crime on these topics together with clear policy guid ance on the approach to be taken by prosecutors in respect of any implied criminal liability in respect of the role played by donors and recipients in thbor cases. to effectively investigate thbor criminal justice profes sionals require specialist knowledge of the procedures and medical protocols attached to legal transplantation as proving deviations from those practices is a critical ele ment of successful prosecution. to this end appropriate criminal justice and medical professionals should collabo rate to produce a detailed step by step breakdown of the entire legal transplant process encompassing initial assess ment practice transplant procedures the medical actors and the documentation trail for the whole process. based on the above investigators and prosecutors should develop detailed and case based guidance for thborcases that should include parallel financial investigation guid ance and checklist style templates for use in the interviews of donors recipients and suspects and which focus espe cially on the use of means of deception and vulnerability and the issue of consent. building on existing specialized thb training programs capacity should be strengthened by the addition of thbor specific tailored trainingmodules for law enforce ment and prosecutorial agencies together with awareness raising initiatives for members of the judiciary. improved cross border cooperation challenges the challenges associated with cross border cooperation in thbor cases replicate those that already characterize cross border cooperation generally and the general lack of awareness complexity and multidimensional nature of thbor cases complicates the overall picture. in legislative terms the challenges are exacerbated by in consistent treaty approaches differences in interpretation of thb law generally and thbor in particular and sig copyright the authors. transplantation di nificance variations in procedural rules appertaining to the admissibility of evidence and duty of disclosure in crimi nal cases. in practical terms variations in national priorities a tendency by practitioners to focus only on the domestic dimension of thbor combined with a general lack of coordination and an inexplicable reluctance to use existing support structures for cross border cooperation all serve to impede significant improvements in cross border cooperation. recommendations investigators and prosecutors should make greater use of existing transnational cooperation structures such as european police office international police office and eurojust and the expertise located within national central authorities. these organizations should either establish or strengthen existing focal point capacity to ensure a proper level of fo cus on and response to thbor cases. more use should be made of joint investigation team tech niques to address transnational thbor cases. greater use should be made of video testimony provisions for taking the testimony of donors recipients and other witnesses. transnational law enforcement structures such as euro pean police office and international police office should cultivate higher levels of cross border information sharing between practitioners and use their existing criminal anal ysis capacity to develop a more accurate assessment of the scale location and modus operandi of thbor and to identify high risk locations. acknowledgments this article was produced by
