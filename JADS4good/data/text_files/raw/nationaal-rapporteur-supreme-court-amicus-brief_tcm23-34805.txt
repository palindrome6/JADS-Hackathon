BRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF THE DUTCH 
NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR ON TRAFFICKING 

IN HUMAN BEINGS AND SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IN 

SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT AMY UNKNOWN 

INTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE1 

 The Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in 
Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children 
(“National Rapporteur”) is an independent official 
organ of the Netherlands.2 The National Rapporteur’s 

 
 1 On September 3, 2013, Counsel for Respondent Amy Un-
known, filed a consent to the filing of amicus curiae briefs in 
support of either or neither party. On September 6, 2013, Coun-
sel for Respondent Wright, Counsel for Respondent United 
States, and Counsel for Petitioner Paroline filed consents to the 
filing of amicus curiae briefs in support of either or neither 
party. No counsel for a party authored this brief wholly or par-
tially, nor made a monetary contribution intended to fund this 
brief ’s preparation or submission. No person other than Amicus 
and her counsel made a monetary contribution to this brief ’s 
preparation or submission.  
 2 The Dutch government created the National Rapporteur 
on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against 
Children in response to the Hague Declaration of 1997, adopted 
at a European Union ministerial conference on combating hu-
man sex trafficking. The National Rapporteur conducts research 
on human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children to fulfill 
the Dutch government’s international treaty obligations. See 
Directive 2011/36/EU, of the European Parliament and the 
Council of 5 April 2011 on Preventing and Combating Traffick-
ing in Human Beings and Protecting Its Victims, and Replacing 
Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA, art. 19, 2011 O.J. (L 
101) 1; Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse art. 
10(2)(b), opened for signature Oct. 25, 2007, C.E.T.S. No. 201 

(Continued on following page)

primary purpose is to report on the nature and extent 
of human trafficking and sexual violence against 
children in the Netherlands. Both globalization and 
the advent of the Internet have significantly en-
hanced the transnational nature of these crimes; with 
the ease of exchanging abusive material over the 
Internet, this is particularly evident in the case of 
child pornography.3 The rapid globalization of the 
child pornography market has compelled nations to 
collaborate in order to combat the challenges of 
twenty-first century child pornography. It is in the 
spirit of both the United States’ and the Netherlands’ 

 
(“Lanzarote Convention”); Directive 2011/92/EU, of the Euro-
pean Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on 
Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Chil-
dren and Child Pornography, and Replacing Council Framework 
Decision 2004/68/JHA, 2011 O.J. (L 335) 1. As of November 15, 
2013, the National Rapporteur is organized under a recently 
enacted Dutch law that replaces a ministerial decree. The law 
maintains the National Rapporteur as an independent official 
organ of the Netherlands.  
 3 The phrase “child pornography” is used in this brief inter-
changeably with “child sexual abuse images.” Use of the latter 
phrase emerged to distinguish it from simulated child pornog-
raphy where no actual child is used in the production of the 
images. Thus, “child sexual abuse images” refers specifically to 
child pornography in which an actual child is abused to produce 
the images. This is the child pornography that the National 
Rapporteur is referring to in this brief since a child is harmed in 
the production of the child sexual abuse images and then con-
tinues to be harmed when the images are distributed and con-
sumed. The term “images” is expansive and may include digital 
imagery, photographs, sketches, cartoons, movies, sound record-
ings, paintings, or any other depiction of the sexual abuse of a 
child regardless of media.

history of international cooperation with regard to 
child pornography, its perpetrators, and, most im-
portantly, its victims, that the National Rapporteur 
respectfully submits this brief in support of Respond-
ent, Amy Unknown.4 

 
 4 The Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-
General on Violence against Children, Marta Santos Pais, asked 
the National Rapporteur to include the following statement from 
Ms. Santos Pais in this brief:  

The Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on Violence against Children (SRSG) has identified 
the opportunities and risks associated with children’s 
access to and use of new information and communica-
tions technologies as a priority for her mandate. This 
work is guided by international human rights stan-
dards, including the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its Optional Protocol on the Sale of Chil-
dren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography which 
recognize children’s right to protection from sexual 
abuse through representation or images in porno-
graphic performances or materials. Child pornogra-
phy is a serious form of violence against children, 
including during its production and dissemination, 
and when it is subsequently viewed by potentially 
thousands of child sex abusers. At the dawn of the 
1990s the exchange of information through cyberspace 
was just beginning. As widespread online access be-
came commonplace, child pornography made its way 
into the global and connected world on the screens of 
personal computers, through mobile phones and social 
media. Information is available more easily and may 
be spread more quickly, potentially reaching out to 
millions in a fraction of a second and remaining acces-
sible for a lifetime, with a serious impact on countless 
children. It is imperative that child victims of this 
form of sexual abuse are given the right to restitution

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 

 The United States’ treaty obligations compel 
reading 18 U.S.C. §2259 without imposing a proxi-
mate cause requirement on (A) through (E). Specifi-
cally, the United States is a party to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography. The Optional Protocol requires, inter 
alia, that state parties support the restoration of 
child pornography victims and provide them with “ac-
cess to adequate procedures to seek . . . damages from 
those legally responsible.”5 Twice the United States 
has expressly identified 18 U.S.C. §2259 in reports to 
the United Nations as the law by which it complies 
with its treaty obligations to support victim recovery.  

 In its most recent report on treaty compli- 
ance, the United States cites specifically to Petitioner 
Paroline’s offense (child pornography possession 
under 18 U.S.C. §2252) and states that the offense 
gives rise to “mandatory restitution” for the “full 

 
for this crime. This is important as a remedy for these 
children, and as a deterrent to prevent future situa-
tions of child sex abuse of this kind. 

 5 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Por-
nography art. 9(4), opened for signature May 25, 2000, T.I.A.S. 
No. 13,095, 2171 U.N.T.S. 227 (entered into force Jan. 18, 2002; 
United States ratified Dec. 23, 2002) (“Optional Protocol”) 
(emphasis added).

amount of the victim’s losses.”6 Moreover, because the 
United States cites no other legal process satisfying 
its Article 9 obligations to provide a recovery mecha-
nism for child pornography victims, this Court should 
not impose a level of causation that would render the 
statute functionally ineffective in the twenty-first 
century. 

 The Court is encouraged to interpret 18 U.S.C. 
§2259 with a respect for the evolving international 
legal norms that nations are collaboratively develop-
ing to protect children and combat a rapidly expand-
ing global child pornography market. The Court 
should also be mindful of the United States’ active 
role in helping to develop these legal norms, which 
include robust protections and support for victim care 
and restoration. Finally, the Court should interpret 
18 U.S.C. §2259 with an accurate understanding of 
the challenges the international community faces 
both in eliminating the child pornography market 
and supporting the restoration of the children victim-
ized by the production, distribution, and possession of 
the images of their abuse. That understanding should 
compel the Court to read the statute as simply as it is 
written: providing full, meaningful restoration to 
child pornography victims.

ARGUMENT 

I. INTERNATIONAL LAW COMPELS NATIONS 
TO SUPPORT THE RESTORATION OF 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY VICTIMS. 

A. The United States’ Treaty Obligations 
Compel Reading the Mandatory Resti-
tution Statute without a Proximate 
Cause Requirement. 

 The United States’ treaty obligations must guide 
the Court’s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. §2259 (“Man-
datory Restitution Statute”). The United States was

(Mar. 25, 1996). It is critical for the Court to appreciate the 
significant role that the United States has assumed in helping 
set the standards of the evolving normative legal framework for 
child pornography crimes internationally, including victim restora-
tion. The fact that the United States required no new legislation 
after it ratified the Optional Protocol evidences this fact. U.S.

child pornography victims, receive medical and psy-

2013). The Optional Protocol additionally and expressly 
requires that parties “ensure that all child victims 
have access to adequate procedures to seek . . . dam-
ages from those legally responsible.” Id. at art. 9(4) 
(emphasis added). Those “legally responsible” include 
offenders found guilty of child pornography posses-
sion. Id. at art. 3(1)(c). Moreover, the Optional Proto-
col requires that the United States and other state 
parties ensure that victims of child pornography have 
access to procedures that are adequate and non-
discriminatory. Id. at art. 9(4) (emphasis added).  

 From the beginning, the United States has relied 
expressly and specifically on 18 U.S.C. §2259 to fulfill 
its treaty obligations under Article 9 of the Optional 
Protocol. The United States first cited the Mandatory 
Restitution Statute in 2007 in its initial report to the 
United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child 
(“U.N. Committee”) regarding the United States’ im-
plementation of the Optional Protocol domestically. 
Initial Report, supra note 7, at 24. The United States’ 
Initial Report explained that 18 U.S.C. §2259 pro-
vides “mandatory restitution for any offense involving 
the sexual exploitation of children.” Id. at para. 89. 
Nowhere does the United States mention proximate 
cause in its report.  

 In 2010, the United States submitted a periodic 
report on its compliance with the Optional Protocol and 
again expressly cited 18 U.S.C. §2259 as providing 
“mandatory restitution for child sexual exploitation 
and other abuse offenses” including 18 U.S.C. §2252, 
which was the child pornography offense to which the 
offender in this case (Randall Paroline) pled guilty.

U.S. Dep’t of State, supra note 6, at para. 421. The 
United States expressly explained in its 2010 report 
that restitution is mandatory and for the “full amount 
of the victim’s losses . . . .” Id. The United States cited 
no other statutory remedy supporting the restoration 
of child pornography victims. Id.  

 After receiving the United States’ Initial Report 
on its compliance with the Optional Protocol, the 
U.N. Committee requested additional information, 
including data for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007 
regarding “The number of child victims provided with 
recovery assistance as indicated in Article 9, para-
graphs 3 and 4 of the Protocol.” U.N. Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, Lists of Issues to be Taken Up 
in Connection with the Consideration of the Initial 
Report of the United States of America, para. 1(c), 
U.N. Doc. CRC/C/OPSC/USA/Q/1 (Feb. 26, 2008). The 
United States’ response did not indicate that a single 
victim had received compensation from an offender 
under the Mandatory Restitution Statute or any 
other statute despite the fact that 18 U.S.C. §2259 
was the cornerstone of the United States’ statement 
of compliance with Article 9, paragraph 4. U.N. Com-
mittee on the Rights of the Child, United States 
Response to Lists of Issues to be Taken Up in Connec-
tion with Consideration of the Initial Report of the 
United States of America, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/OPOSC/ 
USA/1/Add.1 (May 15, 2008). Instead, the United 
States indicated that some victims “may be eligible” 
for a variety of government programs such as Medi-
caid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(“TANF”), and Job Corp. Id. In its Concluding Obser-
vations regarding the United States’ Initial Report,

the U.N. Committee identified the United States as 
“one of the world’s largest producers, distributors and 
consumers of child pornography” and expressly en-
couraged the United States, inter alia, to “[i]mprove 
enforcement of the existing legislative framework on 
child pornography.” U.N. Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, Concluding Observations: United States of 
America, para. 27, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/OPSC/USA/CO/1 
(June 25, 2008) (emphasis added).  

 In 2012, the U.N. Committee again identified 
victim restoration (including compensation to victims) 
as an issue in response to the United States 2010 
periodic report, and requested additional information. 
U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, List of 
Issues Concerning Additional and Updated Informa-
tion Related to the Second Periodic Report of the 
United States of America, para. 12, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/ 
OPSC/USA/Q/2 (July 25, 2012). Specifically, the U.N. 
Committee asked for an indication of the measures 
taken by the United States to ensure that victims 
“are provided with appropriate assistance for their 
full social reintegration, physical, psychological and 
psychosocial recovery, as well as compensation.” Id. 
In its response, the United States again failed to 
identify even one specific measure that it is taking to 
ensure compensation to child pornography victims.

tion Related to the Consideration of the Second Peri-
odic Report of the United States of America: Written 
Replies of the United States of America, U.N. Doc. 
CRC/C/OPSC/USA/Q/2/Add.1 (Dec. 12, 2012). Thus, 



11 

in its Concluding Observations, the U.N. Committee 
expressed concern “about the growing availability of 
child pornography online, the use of ever younger 
children and the increase in the violence of images 
recorded” as well as the fact that sexually exploited 
children in the United States “still lack adequate . . . 
compensation.” U.N. Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Concluding Observations on the Second Peri-
odic Report of the United States of America, paras. 27, 
44, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/OPSC/USA/CO/2 (July 2, 2013). 
“Adequate remedy and reparation should be sought 
legally and through other means,” according to the 
U.N. Committee in addressing the United States’ 
treaty obligations under Articles 8 and 9 of the Op-
tional Protocol. Id. at para. 45. 

 The Optional Protocol also requires that state par-
ties’ criminal justice systems make “the best interest 
of the child” a “primary consideration” in the treat-
ment of child victims. Optional Protocol, supra note 5, 
at art. 8(3). In interpreting 18 U.S.C. §2259, this 
Court should consider whether the United States’ 
treaty obligations under article 8(3) of the Optional 
Protocol compel the Court to consider the “best inter-
est of the child” in deciding whether to impose a 
proximate cause requirement on the plain language 
of the Mandatory Restitution Statute. 

 The Court has held that a treaty is on “the same 
footing and made of like obligation, with an act of 
legislation.” Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190, 194 
(1888); Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 504-07 (2008). 
When a statute and a treaty conflict, the Court will 



12 

give meaning to both, if it can, without violating the 
language of either. Otherwise, the latter in time 
controls. Whitney, 124 U.S. at 194 (noting that if the 
treaty is later in time, it must be self-executing). 
While the Optional Protocol is not self-executing, it is 
the latter in time and by interpreting 18 U.S.C. §2259 
without imposing a proximate cause requirement on 
the statute, the Court can and should give effect to 
both the statute and the treaty without violating the 
language of either. 

 
B. Evolving International Legal Norms 

Support Restoration of Child Pornog-
raphy Victims. 

 Both the United States and the Netherlands 
have been actively involved in developing an inter-
national normative legal framework that includes 
a significant and express focus on the protection of 
children from sexual exploitation and the restoration 
of child victims who are exploited. In interpreting the 
laws of the United States, the Court has turned to 
international law to assess the evolving standards of 
decency. Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 830 
(1988). As the Court interprets the Mandatory Resti-
tution Statute, it should consider the international 
norms that have been evolving during the last cen-
tury.  

 In 1924, the League of Nations adopted the first 
international instrument recognizing the inherent 
uniqueness of childhood and committing to provide 



13 

children with special care and protection. Geneva 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child, Sept. 26, 1924, 
League of Nations, O.J. Spec. Supp. 21 at 43 (1924) 
(expressly stating that children should be protected 
from “every form of exploitation”). The United Na-
tions 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child8 
followed twenty-five years later and expanded on the 
original principles of the 1924 Geneva Declaration 
and incorporated references to the United Nations 
Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights,9 making clear that children are entitled to all 
human rights previously recognized as well as addi-
tional rights due to their special status as children. 
Both the United States and the Netherlands actively 
participated in the drafting of the 1959 Declaration. 
Geraldine Van Bueren, The International Law on the 
Rights of the Child 10 (1998).  

 Principle 2 of the 1959 Declaration states that 
children “shall enjoy special protection, and shall be 
given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other 
means, to enable [them] to develop physically, men-
tally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and

(XIV), GAOR 14th Sess., Supp. No. 16, U.N. Doc. A/4249 (Nov. 
20, 1959) (asserting that “mankind owes to the child the best it 
has to give” and “the child, by reason of his physical and mental 
immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appro-
priate legal protection . . . .”). 
 9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217

childhood is entitled to “special care and assistance”).

normal manner and in conditions of freedom and 
dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose, the 
best interests of the child shall be the paramount 
consideration.” Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 
supra note 8, at princ. 2. Principle 9 further provides 
that children “shall be protected against all forms of 
neglect, cruelty and exploitation. [They] shall not be 
the subject of traffic, in any form.” Id. at princ. 9. It is 
important to note that these were unanimous values 
shared by the international community on the histor-
ical eve of the significant growth of the child pornog-
raphy market in the 1960s and 1970s. See infra 
Section II.A. 

 At the end of the first wave of growth in the 
twentieth century child pornography market, the in-
ternational community celebrated the world’s chil-
dren with the “International Year of the Child” in 
1979, which commenced the drafting process of the 
world’s first binding children’s rights treaty, the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. The drafting of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child involved more than seventy countries (in-
cluding the United States and the Netherlands) and 
spanned ten years. Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, supra note 7. 

 The Convention on the Rights of the Child was 
introduced to the United Nations General Assembly 
in 1989, just four years after the first child pornogra-
phy network was identified on the Internet. Yaman 
Akdeniz, Internet Child Pornography and the Law: 
National and International Responses 5 (2008). The 



15 

Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted 
unanimously by the General Assembly and broke 
records for the greatest number of signatories to a 
treaty on the day it opened for signature. Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, opened for signature Nov. 
20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3; Jean Koh Peters, How 
Children Are Heard in Child Protective Proceedings, 
in the United States and Around the World in 2005: 
Survey Findings, Initial Observations, and Areas for 
Further Study, 6 Nev. L.J. 966, 970 (2006). Today the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most 
widely ratified human rights treaty in the world and 
sets universal standards for the protection of chil-
dren for countries to strive towards and by which 
they agree to be measured. Convention on the Rights 
of the Child Ratification Status, United Nations 
Treaty Collection Database, http://treaties.un.org/ 
Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV- 
11&chapter=4&lang=en (last visited Nov. 12, 2013). 
While the United States has not yet ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, it signed the 
Convention on February 16, 1995, following active 
participation in the drafting process. Id. Further, 
this Court has relied on the near universal ratifica-
tion of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 
gauging the weight of international opinion affirm-
ing the Court’s decision. See Roper v. Simmons, 543 
U.S. 551, 575-79 (2005) (finding unconstitutional the 
imposition of the death penalty for juvenile offend-
ers). 



16 

 The Convention on the Rights of the Child re-
quires that countries take all appropriate measures 
to promote physical and psychological restoration and 
social reintegration of a child victim of exploitation, 
abuse, or any other form of “cruel, inhuman or de-
grading treatment.” Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, supra at art. 39. While the United States has 
only signed the Convention, Article 18 of the Vienna 
Convention on the Law of Treaties requires a nation 
not to defeat the purpose of a treaty before ratifica-
tion. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties art. 
18, opened for signature May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 
331.10  

 Other international treaties also evidence the 
rise of an international norm in the twentieth century 
recognizing that children have a right to special pro-
tections. International Covenant on Civil and Politi-
cal Rights art. 24, opened for signature Dec. 16, 1966, 
999 U.N.T.S. 171 (United States ratified June 8, 1992) 
(noting a child’s right to “measures of protection” from 
state, society, and the child’s family). Nations have gone 
further in developing international instruments that 
require state parties to provide assistance for victims’ 
physical and psychological restoration. Declaration on 

 
 10 Similar to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
United States has signed but not ratified the Vienna Convention 
on the Law of Treaties. However, the United States State De-
partment has recognized many of its provisions as customary in-
ternational law. Maria Frankowska, The Vienna Convention on 
the Law of Treaties Before United States Courts, 28 Va. J. Int’l L. 
281, 298 (1988).

the Elimination of Violence against Women, G.A. Res. 
48/104, art. 2, 3, 4(d), 4(g), U.N. Doc. A/RES/48/104 
(Dec. 20, 1993); ILO Convention No. 182, supra note 
7, at art. 7(2)(b). In ratifying ILO Convention No. 182, 
the Senate did not specifically reference 18 U.S.C. 
§2259 but recognized that the United States already 
criminalized child pornography and that “U.S. law is 
sufficient in order for the United States to comply 
with the Convention.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 106-12, supra 
note 7, at 4. Together, these instruments, along with 
others, convey an emerging international norm con-
demning child sexual abuse and child pornography, 
and compelling state parties to develop laws to pro-
tect and care for children and support their restora-
tion when harmed. 

 In recognizing the need to provide restoration 
services to child pornography victims, the United 
States enacted the Mandatory Restitution Statute as 
part of the Violence Against Women Act, Pub. L. No. 
103-322, §40113, 108 Stat. 1796, 1907 (1994). Fol-
lowing the enactment of the Mandatory Restitu- 
tion Statute, the United States participated in three 
World Congresses against Commercial Sexual Exploi-
tation of Children. The First World Congress called 
on governments to provide recovery services to sex-
ually exploited children. First World Congress against 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, The 
Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action against 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children 5 (1996). 
The Second World Congress recognized that the de-
velopment of technology created more difficulties for 



18 

victims and called on countries to help victims re-
cover and reintegrate into society. Vitit Muntarbhorn, 
General Rapporteur’s Report from Second World Con-
gress against CSEC (2001). At the conclusion of the 
Second World Congress, the United States pointed to 
the Optional Protocol as providing a “clear starting 
point” for the international elimination of the sexual 
exploitation of children. United Nations Children’s 
Fund, The Yokohama Global Commitment (2001). Be-
tween the Second and Third World Congresses, the 
United States conducted a “mid-term review” on the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children in America 
in collaboration with three non-governmental agen-
cies. Initial Report, supra note 7, at para. 84. A report 
from the mid-term review was submitted at the Third 
World Congress and found that the United States 
Congress and Executive Branch had “aggressively” 
confirmed their commitment to combat the sexual ex-
ploitation of children through legislative measures, in-
cluding the recognition and protection of victims’ rights. 
Shared Hope International et al., Report from the U.S. 
Mid-Term Review on the Commercial Sexual Exploi-
tation of Children in America pmbl., add. III at 5 (2006).  

 The Council of Europe has also formed treaties to 
protect children from child sexual abuse. The United 
States actively participated in the drafting of the 
Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime, which 
requires states to adopt legislative and other mea-
sures necessary to criminalize possession of child por-
nography on data storage media. S. Exec. Rep. No. 
109-6, supra note 7, at 2; Convention on Cybercrime, 



19 

supra note 7, at art. 9(1). The United States ratified 
the treaty in 2006 with no need for implementing 
legislation because the United States had complied 
with the Convention on Cybercrime’s provisions prior 
to the drafting of the convention. S. Exec. Rep. No. 
109-6, supra note 7, at 6.  

 Four years later, the Lanzarote Convention ex-
panded on the Convention on Cybercrime to require 
state parties to take all necessary measures to assist 
victims with their physical and psycho-social restora-
tion and adopt a protective approach towards victims. 
Lanzarote Convention, supra note 2, at art. 30(2). 
Although the United States has not ratified the 
Lanzarote Convention, it participated in the drafting 
of the treaty and has been a permanent observer of 
the Council of Europe since 1995. Council of Europe, 
On Observer Status for the United States of America, 
Comm. of Ministers Res. (95) 37 (1995); Council of 
Europe, Explanatory Report: Council of Europe Con-
vention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
Exploitation and Sexual Abuse para. 284 (2007). 
Moreover, the Lanzarote Convention is additional evi-
dence of emerging international legal norms focused 
on criminalizing modern child pornography and pro-
viding for the restoration of victims. 

 The European Union requires member states to 
punish the “acquisition or possession of child pornog-
raphy” and “knowingly obtaining access,” including 
incitement or aiding and abetting. Framework Deci-
sion 2004/68/JHA, art. 3(1)(d), 2003 O.J. (L13) 44; 
Directive 2011/92/EU, supra note 2, at art. 5(2)-(3), 



20 

7(1). Significantly, in accordance with the Optional 
Protocol, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
and the Lanzarote Convention, the new legislation 
will oblige member states to provide assistance, sup-
port, and protection to victims, taking into account 
the best interests of the child. Directive 2011/92/EU, 
supra note 2, at art. 18(1). Among other things, this 
includes ensuring that victims have access to free 
legal representation for “the purpose of claiming com-
pensation.” Id. at art. 20(2). 

 Furthermore, member states must ensure that 
victims receive assistance and support before, during, 
and after the criminal proceedings so that they may 
“exercise their rights set out in Framework Decision 
2001/220/JHA.” Id. at art. 19(1). Framework Decision 
2001/220/JHA directs member states to ensure that 
victims of crime receive adequate protection, acknowl-
edgement of their rights, and special assistance. 
Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA, of 15 March 2001 
on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings 
2001 O.J. (L082) 1.  

 The European Union has recently expanded the 
rights, support, protection, and compensation for victims 
of crime, including an acknowledgement of Directive 
2011/92/EU, by implementing Directive 2012/29/EU, 
which will replace Directive 2001/220/JHA in 2015. 
Directive 2012/29/EU, of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 25 October 2012 Establishing 
Minimum Standards on the Rights, Support and 
Protections of Victims of Crime, and Replacing Coun-
cil Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA, 2012 O.J. 



21 

(L315) 57. It instructs member states to protect 
victims from continuing victimization and ensure 
that victims receive “appropriate support to facilitate 
their recovery.” Id. at pmbl. para. 9. Victim support 
services must provide, at a minimum, emotional and 
psychological support services. Id. at art. 9. Member 
states must ensure that victims also have the right 
to receive compensation from offenders through a 
judgment in criminal proceedings. Id. at art. 16(1). 
Member states are obliged to promote measures to 
“encourage offenders to provide adequate compensa-
tion to victims.” Id. at art. 16(2). The new Directive 
2012/29/EU demonstrates the European Union’s evolv-
ing standards on crime victim standing, and when 
read in conjunction with Article 19 of Directive 2011/ 
92/EU, it furthers the aim to provide greater compen-
sation and support for victims of child pornography. 

 In sum, the United States and European nations, 
including the Netherlands, have played an active role 
in developing an international legal framework that 
condemns child sexual abuse and the proliferation of 
child sexual abuse images. This framework also rec-
ognizes the harm done to victims and the need to 
provide for their restoration. Under the Optional 
Protocol, the United States has identified the Manda-
tory Restitution Statute as its means of ensuring that 
child pornography victims have access to recovery 
from offenders. By not imposing proximate cause on 
subsections (A)-(E) of 18 U.S.C. §2259, the United 
States gives effect to the statute, Article 9 of the 
Optional Protocol, and the normative international 



22 

legal framework that the United States has actively 
worked to create with other nations to combat child 
sexual abuse.  

 
II. MODERN TECHNOLOGIES ADD CHAL-

LENGING COMPLEXITIES TO THE AN-
CIENT CRIME OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.  

A. The Child Pornography Market in the 
Digital Age Compels a Comprehensive 
Legal Response by the United States.  

 In many countries, including the United States, 
the sexual abuse of children has been condemned for 
hundreds of years, yet the invention of photography 
in 1839 added an element of complexity to this an-
cient crime. National Rapporteur on Trafficking in 
Human Beings, First Report of the Dutch National 
Rapporteur: Child Pornography 33 (2011) (Neth.); see 
Christian Laes, Children in Ancient Rome 244 (2006);

the sexual abuse of a child and use those images to 
continue to abuse the child. DNR, supra, at 34. The 
child sexual abuse images themselves became the 
currency in a market commonly referred to as “child 
pornography,” in which the creation, distribution, and 
possession of child sexual abuse images perpetuate 
the sexual abuse of children and normalizes conduct 



23 

that most civilizations have condemned. Suzanne 
Ost, Child Pornography and Sexual Grooming 109 
(2009); Laes, supra, at 244; Lascaratos, supra. 

 The technological limitations of cameras and the 
physical limitations on delivery methods, such as 
postal services, restricted the growth of the child por-
nography market for more than one hundred years. 
U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, Report to Congress: Federal 
Child Pornography Offenses 5, 41, 328 (Dec. 2012); 
DNR, supra, at 35-48. However, with the introduction 
in the mid-twentieth century of cameras that were af-
fordable and easier to use, technological advances 
again contributed to a significant expansion of the 
child pornography market, especially when coupled 
with a loosening in the 1960s and 1970s of social 
mores with regard to human sexuality. DNR, supra, 
at 34. Because the significant expansion in the child 
pornography market during this period was evident 
in the United States and Europe, nations responded 
with tighter and more effective legal protections for 
children.11  

 In the United States, Congress criminalized child 
sexual abuse images in the late twentieth century, 

 
 11 In the 1970s, countries began to enact laws that tight-
ened prohibitions on child pornography, which included banning 
the commercialization of child sexual abuse images. Prior to 
tightening regulations, child sexual abuse images were commer-
cially available alongside adult pornography in many countries. 
Child pornography activities were made into criminal offenses in 
the Netherlands in 1986. DNR, supra, at 34-37. 



24 

and this Court upheld the rights of states to adopt 
legislation banning the production and distribution of 
child pornography. New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 
(1982); Protection of Children against Sexual Exploi-
tation Act of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7 
(1978). In doing so, the Court recognized the continu-
ing harm inherent in child pornography. Ferber, 485 
U.S. at 759 n.10 (“Because the child’s actions are 
reduced to a recording, the pornography may haunt 
. . . [the child] in future years, long after the original 
misdeed took place.”). In Osborne v. Ohio, the Court 
later upheld the criminalization of possession of child 
sexual abuse images, reiterating that continuing 
victimization is inherent to child pornography crimes. 
495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990) (“The pornography’s contin-
ued existence causes the child victim’s continuing 
harm by haunting the children in years to come.”).  

 Four years after Osborne, the United States Con-
gress enacted 18 U.S.C. §2259, mandating that of-
fenders at all points in the child pornography market 
(production, distribution, and possession) pay full 
restitution to victims. Mandatory restitution was part 
of a comprehensive federal statutory framework that 
also included clear definitions and criminalizing par-
ticipation at any stage of the child pornography 
market. 18 U.S.C. §§2251-2260. Recently, the United 
States Congress responded to the increasingly global 
nature of child sexual crimes by enacting the Prose-
cutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploi-
tation of Children Today Act (PROTECT Act), which, 
inter alia, allows authorities in the United States to 



25 

prosecute citizens of the United States when they 
sexually abuse children abroad. 18 U.S.C. §2423 
(2012). Similar to the PROTECT Act, a plain reading 
of the Mandatory Restitution Statute provides a more 
robust tool to protect children in light of rapidly 
changing technologies and the increasingly transna-
tional nature of child sexual abuse.  

 The United States’ domestic and international 
efforts are appropriate because unfortunately, the 
United States is the most common country of origin 
for child pornography victims. DNR, supra, at 166 
n.315 (relying on images being compiled in Interpol’s 
International Child Sexual Exploitation Database). 
The United States also is the leading source country 
for perpetrators. Id. at 82, 166 n.316 (citing to an 
ECPAT International report indicating that between 
50,000 and 100,000 pedophiles participate in orga-
nized child pornography groups around the world and 
one-third of those operate from the United States). 
The significant number of child sexual abuse images 
produced in the United States allows perpetrators 
in other countries to continue the victimization of 
American children by distributing or possessing their 
child sexual abuse images. See, e.g., Philip Jenkins, 
Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet 
184-203 (2001) (noting the “global community” of 
child pornography collectors). Similarly, children of 
other countries, including Dutch children, continue to 
be victimized in the United States by perpetrators 
who distribute or possess images of the child’s abuse. 
Id.; see infra Section II.D.

B. Child Pornographers Collectively Con-
tinue the Victimization of Children 
Globally and Indefinitely. 

 The United States’ statutory framework attempts 
to respond to the rise of digital technologies and the 
widespread use of the Internet in the late twenti- 
eth century, which together facilitated the explosive 
growth in the child pornography market that we con-
tinue to witness today. Millions of individual users 
consume more than fifteen million child sexual abuse 
images in a market currently valued between three 
and twenty billion United States dollars annually. 
Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child 
Prostitution and Child Pornography, Report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child 
Prostitution and Child Pornography, paras. 10, 44, 
Human Rights Council, U.N. Doc. A/HRC12/23 (July 
13, 2009) (by Najat M’jid Maalla) (“United Nations 
Special Rapporteur Report”). Moreover, with the rapid 
proliferation of Internet usage, the child pornography 
market is projected to continue growing exponen-
tially.12 

 The transformation from tangible to digital child 
sexual abuse images has had a debilitating effect 
on victims, as well as the governments committed to 

 
 12 Between 1996 and 2009, the number of people with In-
ternet access has increased from 100 million to 1.25 billion and 
continues to rise. Robert J. Edelmann, Exposure to Child Abuse 
Images as Part of One’s Work: Possible Psychological Implica-
tions, 21 J. Forensic Psychiatry & Psychol. 481 (2010). 



27 

battling this crime. Because images of the child’s 
victimization are now digitalized, it is virtually im-
possible to destroy them permanently. U.S. Sentenc-
ing Comm’n, supra, at 112; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, The 
National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention 
and Interdiction 9 (2010); DNR, supra, at 75. Thus, 
images of the child’s sexual abuse exist indefinitely. 
Moreover, the Internet compounds this challenge be-
cause child sexual abuse images can be easily dis-
tributed and consumed countless times around the 
world by millions of unidentified perpetrators. DNR, 
supra, at 75. Today’s child pornography victims exper-
ience continuing victimization by perpetrators who 
together perpetuate the distribution and possession of 
the victims’ sexual abuse images indefinitely.13 Jenkins, 
supra, at 187-95. Worse, as the child pornography 
market grows exponentially and transnationally, the 
majority of the perpetrators are never apprehended, 
which makes the prosecution of perpetrators and the 
restoration of victims especially challenging. 

 As child pornography victims grow older, many 
come to realize that the images of their sexual abuse 
will continue to exist and be consumed for the re-
mainder of their lives, and they are largely powerless 

 
 13 Many child pornography market participants engage in 
all three market stages (creation, distribution, and possession), 
but even those who only enter the market at one point collec-
tively participate in a market that at every stage victimizes 
some of the most vulnerable members of society and then per-
petuates that victimization indefinitely. See United Nations Spe-
cial Rapporteur Report, supra, at 10-11.

to end the abuse.14 U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, supra, at 
112; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 9; DNR, supra, at 
36, 50, 75-77. This knowledge may haunt the victims 
for years because possessors and distributors will 
continue to consume, and possibly distribute, the 
images and recordings. DNR, supra, at 75. A recent 
survey revealed that almost ninety-five percent of 
victims suffer lifelong psychological damage and may 
never overcome the harm, even after lifelong therapy. 
U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at D-12. The continued 
victimization can take an extreme physical, psycho-
logical, and financial toll on the victim and the vic-
tim’s family. See U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, supra, at 
112; Julia von Weiler et al., Care and Treatment of 
Child Victims of Child Pornographic Exploitation 
(CPE) in Germany, 16 J. of Sexual Aggression 211, 
218-19 (2010). Victims of child pornography may have 
difficulty maintaining jobs and relationships because 
of the fear that people they interact with have viewed 
the abuse images and will recognize them. See U.S. 
Sentencing Comm’n, supra, at 113. They also worry 
that perpetrators will use their abuse images for the 
purposes of grooming other children in order to fa-
cilitate subsequent sexual abuse; sexual grooming 

 
 14 Child sexual abuse images are becoming more violent and 
graphic as perpetrators demand younger victims, vaginal and 
anal penetration (sometimes with sex toys and foreign objects), 
rape, bestiality, defecation and urination, bondage, torture, and 
other sadistic behavior. U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, supra, at 85, 
90-92; Internet Watch Foundation, Annual and Charity Report 8 
(2008). 



29 

further expands the market and increases the num-
ber of victims. Id. 

 The psychological damage that child pornography 
victims suffer is experienced across cultures. For 
example, German victims report feelings of shame, 
hate, disgust, loathing, fear, repression, guilt, and 
speechlessness. Von Weiler, supra, at 214. Victims 
in the United States have also reported feelings of 
depression, anger, withdrawal, low self-esteem, and 
feelings of worthlessness. Terre des Hommes, Full-
screen on View: An Exploratory Study on the Back-
ground and Psychosocial Consequences of Webcam 
Child Sex Tourism in the Philippines 12 (2013). The 
mere knowledge of the existence and circulation of 
the images of the victim’s sexual abuse causes feel-
ings of shame, humiliation, and powerlessness. Id. at 
13. Unfortunately, these feelings do not dissipate over 
time, but rather intensify to feelings of deep despair, 
worthlessness, and helplessness. Id. A recent study of 
Filipino children who were engaged by Westerners to 
participate in live digital sexual abuse via the Inter-
net (“webcam sex”) similarly demonstrated signifi-
cantly higher rates of post-traumatic stress and 
feelings of low self-esteem, worthlessness, shame, 
guilt, and being contaminated, particularly after 
learning that the images of their sexual abuse may 
be available on the Internet indefinitely. Id. at 41, 
43. 

 Compounding the problems faced by victims of 
child pornography, a recent survey among German 
 



30 

victim assistance professionals found that profes-
sionals are ill equipped to deal with the type of psy-
chological damage suffered by child pornography 
victims; thus, it is difficult for victims to find effective 
therapeutic support. Von Weiler, supra, at 218. The 
professionals in the von Weiler study indicated that 
“working with victims of [child pornographic exploita-
tion] is more complex than working with child sexual 
abuse victims.” Id. at 217. The difference in the 
psychological harm suffered by child pornography 
victims compared to victims of other crimes is the 
permanent presence of the material on the Internet. 
When the victim fully understands this reality, feel-
ings of helplessness, powerlessness, shame, and fear 
contribute to additional psychological stress. These 
victims, thus, have a higher susceptibility to post-
traumatic stress disorder, depression, and psychoses. 
Id. at 214-19. Two-thirds of professionals working 
with child pornography victims reported that they 
themselves felt “deep feelings of helplessness” because 
the victim’s sexual abuse images on the Internet were 
permanent. Id. at 217 (emphasis added). Indeed, one-
third of the professionals treating child pornography 
victims experienced thoughts such as “in this situa-
tion healing becomes impossible.” Id.  

   



31 

C. Due to the International Nature of 
Child Pornography in the Twenty-First 
Century, Imposing a Proximate Cause 
Requirement on the Plain Text of 18 
U.S.C. §2259 Would Impede the Full Res-
toration of Child Pornography Victims. 

 As discussed in more detail in Section I, supra, 
the international community recognizes the rights of 
victims of child pornography to rehabilitation, social 
reintegration, and restoration (whether through resti-
tution, damages, or some other method). However, 
the increasingly transnational nature of child pornog-
raphy means that many perpetrators harm victims 
across national borders through the distribution or 
possession of the victim’s child sexual abuse images 
digitally. A recent study by United States’ law en-
forcement agencies found that 11.8 million unique 
international IP addresses engaged in peer-to-peer 
file sharing of child pornography between October 
2008 and October 2009. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, 
at 14 (emphasis added). During that same period, 9.7 
million unique IP addresses in the United States 
engaged in peer-to-peer file sharing of child sexual 
abuse images. Id. A 2012 report by the Internet 
Watch Foundation in the United Kingdom found that 
out of the 9,477 reports of websites hosting child 
sexual abuse content outside of the United Kingdom, 
fifty-four percent were hosted in North America, 
thirty-seven percent were hosted in Europe, and 
eight percent were hosted in Asia. Internet Watch 
Foundation, supra note 14, at 14. In 2011, a trans-
national investigation resulted in the shutdown of a 



32 

child pornography network, boylover.net, which 
hosted 70,000 members worldwide. The investigation 
was coordinated among thirteen different countries, 
including the United States and the Netherlands, and 
resulted in the identification of 670 suspects, 184 ar-
rests, and the safeguarding of 230 children. More than 
200 Children Identified and Rescued in Worldwide 
Police Operation, Europol (Mar. 16, 2011), https://www. 
europol.europa.eu/content/more-200-children-identified- 
and-rescued-worldwide-police-operation. 

 The transnational and digital nature of the child 
pornography market severely restricts the ability of 
victims to pursue restitution from most perpetrators. 
Most countries do not have adequate child pornog-
raphy laws, including the criminalization of child 
pornography. See DNR, supra, at 54-55. Further, the 
patchwork nature of child pornography laws across 
jurisdictions hampers both law enforcement and the 
ability of victims to pursue restoration. Many perpe-
trators live thousands of miles away and are never 
apprehended, let alone prosecuted. If a perpetrator 
were convicted, the cost to the victim in pursuing 
restitution in a foreign jurisdiction would be consid-
erable, making recovery both impractical and unlike-
ly. Even when a perpetrator is convicted in the 
victim’s own jurisdiction (assuming there are legal 
protections), a court cannot determine the specific 
restitution proximately caused by a single offender 
among an unknown number of offenders at a certain 
place and point in time when the harm continues 
indefinitely. Imposing a proximate cause requirement 
on 18 U.S.C. §2259 makes the Mandatory Restitution 



33 

Statute unworkable, and thus, ineffective for victim 
restoration. That is the fundamental problem that is 
solved by the Fifth Circuit’s plain reading of 18 
U.S.C. §2259. 

 
D. Dutch Lawmakers Are Also Formulat-

ing Legal Solutions to Ensure Compen-
sation to Child Pornography Victims.  

 Like the United States, the Netherlands is also 
trying to implement an effective legal scheme to 
ensure compensation to victims of child pornography. 
The central provision in the Dutch Criminal Code on 
child pornography criminalizes “an individual who 
distributes, offers, openly exhibits, produces, imports, 
conveys, exports, acquires, has possession of or know-
ingly gains access to” child sexual abuse images. 
Wetboek van Strafrecht [Sr] [Criminal Code] art. 
240b (Neth.). The Netherlands added “knowingly 
gaining access” to this list, in response to the Lanzarote 
Convention, which further defines the criminalized 
possession of pornography to include viewing of child 
sexual abuse images using recently developed tech-
nologies such as “cloud storage” that do not require 
the downloading of images. Id. 

 While Dutch law does not provide the same kind 
of victim restoration as in 18 U.S.C. §2259, Sr art. 36f 
does mandate victim compensation for all criminal 
acts. Sr art. 36f (Neth.). Under this section, offenders 
may be obliged to pay compensation to the State, 
which transfers the sum without delay to the victim. 
Sr art. 36f (Neth.). In addition, this section connects 



34 

compensation in criminal proceedings to the notion of 
liability in accordance with tort law. Like Dutch 
criminal law in general, Sr art. 36f incorporates a 
causality theory of “reasonable attribution,” which is 
a comprehensive amalgamation of all older theories of 
causality that have proven inadequate under certain 
circumstances. Jaap de Hullu, Materieel Strafrecht: Over 
algemene leerstukken van strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid 
naar Nederlands recht 173-84 (4th ed. 2009) (Neth.) 
(explaining why condition sine qua non and proxi-
mate cause do not suffice and how Dutch criminal law 
has adopted the doctrine of reasonable attribution 
consistent with tort law principles). The fundamental 
question underlying causality examines when a court 
can “reasonably attribute” damage to the perpetra-
tor’s conduct. This allows judges to weigh all the 
important circumstances in the case.  

 The National Rapporteur reads the Mandatory 
Restitution Statute’s general causation requirement 
as similar to the Dutch theory of reasonable attribu-
tion, both of which are less strict standards of causa-
tion than proximate cause. In the case of possession 
of child pornography, the victim’s harm can reasona-
bly be attributed to the perpetrator’s consumption of 
child pornography, as this continues the victimization 
indefinitely.  

 Dutch child pornography case law has been con-
tinuously evolving to affirm this causal connection 
where offenders are charged solely with possession. 
Similar to this Court’s finding in Osborne v. Ohio, 
Dutch courts have held that offenders who collect 



35 

child pornography participate in the sexual abuse 
of children. Osborne, 495 U.S. at 111; Rb. Zutphen 18 
november 2009, NJFS 2010, 42, ECLI:NL:RBZUT:2009: 
BK3742 (Neth.). More recently, a Dutch court of appeals 
held that a perpetrator contributed to the perpetua-
tion of “this very grave violation of the interests of 
minors.” Hof’s-Gravenhage 2 juni 2011, ECLI:NL:GHSGR: 
2011:BR5919 (Neth.). The judgment continued, “It is 
common knowledge that thereby [minors] can incur 
heavy psychological (and physical) damage, which 
can be detrimental to their further development. The 
accused should have realized that by his actions, he 
made a considerable contribution to the conserva- 
tion of this extremely harmful worldwide industry.”15 
Id. 

 Dutch courts have begun to impose joint and sev-
eral liability principles on child pornography offend-
ers. In 2010, the United States authorities arrested 
an individual charged with possession of child sexual 
abuse images that originated from the Netherlands. 

 
 15 See also Rb. Zeeland-West Brabant 11 juli 2013, ECLI: 
NL:RBZWB:2013:5231 (Neth.). The perpetrator was found guilty 
of child pornography and the court stated, “Child pornography is 
highly undesirable, in particular because its production involves 
sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The accused should be 
held partially responsible for that, because by collecting child 
pornography he contributed to the conservation of the demand 
for this material. As long as there are consumers of child por-
nography, people who produce and distribute it will continue to 
abuse children. To effectively combat child pornography, it is 
therefore not only necessary to address the producers, but def-
initely also to tackle the collectors.” 



36 

Dutch law enforcement found the producer of the 
content and arrested him. The producer, Robert M., 
had worked in daycare centers for years, where he 
had sexually abused children and recorded the abuses 
for distribution. Robert M.’s husband, Richard van O., 
was charged with possession. The court held both of-
fenders jointly and severally liable for damage caused 
to the victims through the possession of the images, 
and ordered Richard van O. to pay compensation to 
dozens of children depicted in the abuse materials.16 
Hof Amsterdam 26 april 2013, ECLI:NL:GHAMS: 
2013:BZ8895 (Neth./Richard van O.) (Neth.). Robert 
M. was solely liable to pay for the victims’ damages 
caused by the original physical sexual abuse that was 
recorded in the images. Id. Although the offenders 
had a close personal relationship, the fact remains 
that Richard van O. was found jointly and severally 
liable for post-production damages to child pornogra-
phy victims based solely on possession of the images. 
Id. The Netherlands’ theory of causation and use of 
joint and several liability principles to multiple of-
fenders makes for an efficient system where victims 
have reduced burdens to facilitate recovery of the 
costs for their restoration. 

 

 
 16 Robert M. and Richard van. O.’s liability derived from a 
violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights, the right to private life. Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms art. 8, opened for 
signature Nov. 4, 1950, C.E.T.S. No. 005.  



37 

CONCLUSION 

 The United States’ treaty obligations and evolv-
ing international legal norms support providing mean-
ingful recovery to child pornography victims through 
the Mandatory Restitution Statute to support their 
restoration. Imposing proximate cause on the plain 
language of subsections (A)-(E) would eviscerate the 
ability of child pornography victims to obtain ade-
quate restitution for their losses from perpetrators 
who collectively perpetuate their victimization indef-
initely through the production, distribution, and pos-
session of child sexual abuse images all around the 
globe. This Court should interpret the Mandatory 
Restitution Statute so that the statute provides full, 
meaningful restoration to child pornography victims.  

 For these reasons, the Dutch National Rapporteur 
supports affirming the decision of the Fifth Circuit in 
all respects.
