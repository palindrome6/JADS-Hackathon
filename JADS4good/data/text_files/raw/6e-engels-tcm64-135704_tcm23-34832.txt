 Introduction 

1.1 Introduction 

Continuing the regular pattern of alternating between comprehensive reports with qualita-
tive and quantitative information and shorter statistical updates, this sixth report of the 
Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings (NRM) is devoted mainly to 
statistics covering the period up to and including 2006. The Dutch government has not yet 
given a detailed response to the fifth report, which appeared in the summer of 2007, nor has 
it been debated in parliament. Consequently, some of the 66 recommendations made in that 
report have not yet been implemented. Others have already been addressed or measures are 
currently being prepared to address them. For example, national legislation is being drafted 
with a framework for more stringent rules governing municipal bye-laws relating to estab-
lishments where commercial sexual services are provided (recommendation 2NRM5); there 
have been some positive developments with regard to the B9 regulation for victims of hu-
man trafficking, for example with respect to temporary residence permits, and with regard 
to continued residence (recommendations 4 to 10NRM5); a Human Trafficking Task Force 
has been set up and talks are underway on category-oriented initial reception for victims of 
human trafficking (recommendation 35NRM5). Moreover, in 2007 the police again published 
a Police Monitor on prostitution and human trafficking (Korpsmonitor prostitutie & mensen-
handel) detailing their efforts and success in monitoring licensed prostitution and combating 
illegal prostitution and human trafficking. The first trend report on the position of victims of 
human trafficking who have been exploited in the sex industry also appeared in 2007. Al-
though these and other developments are not covered in detail in this statistical report, some 
recent developments in the Netherlands are briefly described in this introductory chapter. 

1.2 Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry 

The fifth report contained a lengthy section on trafficking in human beings (THB) with a 
view to exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry. One of the conclusions was that 
the absence of a precise definition of exploitation had hampered efforts to identify, investi-
gate and prosecute human trafficking in sectors outside the sex industry in the period im-
mediately following the entry into force of Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code. In the 
meantime, several (new) chain partners have taken steps to combat exploitation in these 
other sectors and to make provision for suitable care for victims of this type of THB. We 
confine ourselves here to mentioning the first criminal prosecutions that were brought 
against persons charged with this form of human trafficking. 
Up to 1 February 2008, four investigations had led to prosecutions for the exploitation of 
workers in sectors other than the sex industry. In November 2006, a number of defendants

 2 

who were charged with using Bulgarians living illegally in the Netherlands to pick hemp 
were acquitted of human trafficking. In another case, the chef and sous-chef of a Chinese 
restaurant were also acquitted of human trafficking in the district court and the court of ap-
peal. The public prosecution service has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. In the 
autumn of 2007, the prosecution of three individuals for human trafficking with a view to 
the exploitation of Polish cleaning ladies also failed. At the time of writing, the verdicts in 
this case can still be appealed. The first convictions, which are not yet final and conclusive, 
came in December 2007. In that case, the district court described the conditions under which 
the defendants had housed and employed their illegal Indian domestic staff as tantamount to 
human trafficking. An important factor in this case was that the defendants had created a 
situation in which these people were entirely dependent on them, to the extent that it consti-
tuted a serious violation of their physical and mental integrity and their personal freedom. 
The case law up to now confirms that Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code only relates 
to excessive abuses in employment situations. At the same time, there are numerous pitfalls 
when it comes to weighing up the facts and circumstances in cases involving forms of ex-
ploitation in sectors other than the sex industry. Examples include the question of whether 
or not the worker had any realistic alternative, the relevance of who took the initiative for a 
finding that there has been human trafficking and whether or not the employee agreed to 
particular conditions. The scope of the prohibition on THB ‘not related to the sex industry’ 
will probably become progressively clearer through case law. Developments should be 
guided by the principles laid down in the treaties that the Netherlands has signed and ratified 
and European legislation. 

1.3 Some developments around B9 and continued residence 

One of the positive developments with respect to Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implemen-
tation Guidelines (the B9 regulation) is that since 14 November 2007 a temporary residence 
permit can also be granted to victims who do not report a case of THB but do cooperate in 
some other way with the investigation and prosecution.1 This latest version of the B9 regula-
tion contains a passage on granting aliens who are in alien detention a period for reflection: 
“If there is evidence that an alien in detention is a victim of human trafficking, the police 
must inform the alien of the possibility of reporting the crime to the police or otherwise co-
operating with the criminal investigation or prosecution. The suspected victim of human 
trafficking is then also entitled to the reflection period. The consequence of the granting of 
the reflection period shall be that the grounds for the detention shall lapse and the detention 
must therefore be ended”. However, the passage also states that the reflection period shall 
only be granted in these cases if the public prosecution department and the police agree to it. 
It is not yet clear what the criteria will be and what the implications of these conditions will 
be in practice.  

                                                                      
1 For example, by making a statement or testifying as a witness. 



INTRODUCTON 

 3 

Recommendation 8NRM5 was that the grounds for continued residence under section a of 
chapter B16/7 in the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (the victim has reported a 
criminal offence for a prosecution that has led to a conviction) should not be confined to 
prosecutions that have led to a conviction for human trafficking. There should be a presump-
tion in law that repatriation would involve risks for the victim if the indictment included 
human trafficking even if the suspect is convicted of another criminal offence relating to 
THB but not for THB itself. This recommendation was adopted in the most recent amend-
ment of this section of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines. 
Furthermore, in accordance with another recommendation of the NRM the grounds for 
continued residence have been amended to more clearly reflect the fact that after three years 
in the B9 regulation the length of time the victim has resided in the Netherlands constitutes 
the humanitarian ground on which an application for continued residence can be approved.  
It has also been made explicit that the stated grounds for approving continued residence, 
such as fear of reprisals, fear of prosecution for prostitution and the absence of possibilities 
for social reintegration, are not exhaustive.2 

1.4 Appointment of Human Trafficking Task Force 

The fifth report on human trafficking concluded with the observation that many of the 66 
recommendations were concerned with putting into practice arrangements that were al-
ready laid down in black and white and that a ‘high-level’ THB Task Force, with representa-
tives from all the relevant chain partners, could play an important role in stimulating and fa-
cilitating that. This recommendation was quickly addressed and a task force was indeed 
established on 27 February 2008 under the chairmanship of the member of the Council of 
Procurators General responsible for the THB portfolio. The decree establishing the task 
force, which will meet three times a year, states that one of its duties is to identify and to 
solve or address bottlenecks. The NRM, who is herself a member of the task force, assumed 
from the outset that such a task force would also include representatives of NGOs. When it 
became clear that this was possibly not the intention, she repeatedly urged that NGOs 
should participate. The fact that the victim assistance is not represented in the task force is a 
missed opportunity 

1.5 Municipalities (Amsterdam) 

Municipalities also have a responsibility in preventing and tackling human trafficking. One 
of the municipalities that has been particularly active in this regard is Amsterdam. In re-
sponse to findings of abuses in the Red Light District, the city put forward a package of 
measures designed, among other things, to crack down on human trafficking. For example, 

                                                                      
2 Other examples might be that the alien is suffering from psychological problems and is being treated in the 

Netherlands, is responsible for the care of children who were born in the Netherlands or are pursuing their 
education here, and the position of single women in the country of origin.

one of the proposals is to make enjoying financial benefits directly from a relationship with a 
prostitute a criminal offence. Other suggestions are to bar pimps who cause a nuisance from 
the area and to raise the minimum age for working as a prostitute to twenty-one. The pack-
age also contained preventive measures, some of them targeted at offenders, such as training 
for prostitutes to help them resist the overtures of people who might exploit them and se-
curing the involvement of imams to help tackle the problem of loverboys. The desirability 
and feasibility of these and other measures are still being studied. Meanwhile, the city has 
already closed and/or bought up a number of brothels and premises where window prosti-
tution was carried on. 
The NRM endorses the need for creative and innovative approaches in dealing with the 
problem of human trafficking. At the same time, it is vital to pursue an integrated approach 
and in that context the illegal prostitution circuit must also be firmly dealt with, especially 
since the envisaged plans are likely to lead to a shift of prostitution to the ‘illegal circuit’. Po-
lice capacity must be released for this. 

1.6 Trend report on the position of victims of human trafficking 

The 2006 trend report on the position of victims of THB who have been exploited in the sex 
industry (Van Vianen et al., 2007) presented the findings of a monitor that was developed to 
periodically survey the position of these victims on the basis of a number of indicators. The 
intention was to measure the trend every two years, but it is impossible to acquire reliable 
information on quite a number of indicators and the researchers have concluded that before 
monitoring the situation again investment will be needed to improve the quality of registra-
tion and information gathering. Another question raised is whether the Bureau of the NRM 
(BNRM) can include some of the indicators that are reliable in the annual THB reports. A 
number of the indicators used in the monitor are already regularly included in the BNRM 
reports; others can be added. It has to be noted here that, as Vianen et al. (2007) also men-
tioned, in several of the databases that are used it is impossible to differentiate according to 
the sector in which the exploitation occurred. Whereas in 2006, the year covered by the first 
trend report, there were still only occasional cases of exploitation in sectors other than the 
sex industry, which will have little or no effect on identified trends, this will change with the 
growing attention devoted to this phenomenon. This is also a problem for BNRM. Al-
though BNRM’s area of operations encompasses human trafficking in general, it is never-
theless very important to be able to indicate in the reports which part of the quantitative data 
about investigations, prosecutions and B9 applications and permit awards relates to exploi-
tation in the sex industry and which part relates to exploitation in other economic sectors or 
perhaps to human trafficking with a view to the removal of organs.  
An important added value of the trend report was that various databases were linked to each 
other, which provided more insight into which databases can be linked and what informa-
tion those linkages yield.

1.7 The contents of the report 

Chapter 2 is concerned with the victims of THB. It contains data about their age, gender and 
country of origin from the Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (Coordinatiecen-
trum Mensenhandel – Comensha) and information about B9 applications and permit awards 
from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Immigratie en Naturalisatie Dienst; IND). 
Chapter 3 presents data relating to suspects of THB and perpetrators convicted of THB, 
with statistics about their age, country of origin and gender. The data come from the public 
prosecution service. 
Chapter 4 concerns the prosecution of suspects of human trafficking. It contains data on the 
number and nature of the cases registered with the public prosecution department, how the 
cases were handled by the public prosecutor and the disposition of the cases by the courts. 

Finally, a word of thanks is owed to all the individuals and agencies that have contributed to 
this report.

 Victims 

2.1 Introduction 

This chapter contains statistical data on victims of THB. The background details include the 
age, gender and country of origin of the victims. There are also statistics about the number 
of applications and permits awarded under the B9 regulation and (concise) information 
about compensation awarded to victims. The information comes from the Coordination 
Centre for Human Trafficking (Comensha), formerly the Foundation against Trafficking in 
Women (Stichting tegen Vrouwenhandel; STV) and the Immigration and Naturalisation Ser-
vice (Immigratie en Naturalisatie Dienst; IND). The information about compensation comes 
from the records of the public prosecution service. 

2.2 Register of victims maintained by Comensha 

One of Comensha’s tasks is to register (possible) victims of THB. These are victims who 
have been reported to Comensha in various ways and by various reporters rather than vic-
tims who can be regarded as ‘official victims’ on the basis of a formal assessment against 
specific criteria.1 

However, not all victims are identified and victims who have been identified are not all re-
ported. Because Comensha relies on third parties for information and says itself that it lacks 
the capacity needed to retrieve this information to the extent that it is available elsewhere, 
little is known2 about many of the victims that have been reported. Consequently, it is in 
practice impossible to produce cross tabulations on more than basic features such as coun-
try of origin, age and gender. There is possibly also some duplication, especially where the 
information is limited. 

The number of (possible) victims of THB registered by Comensha has grown annually: 
from 403 in 2004 to 424 in 2005 and to 579 in 2006.3 The information in this section is based 
largely on databases provided by Comensha. The figures presented differ in several respects 

                                                                      
1 This is an important point because these statistics on victims are often compared with data from other coun-

tries, which usually relate exclusively to the ‘officially recognised victims’ and for that reason, as far as foreign 
victims are concerned, can best be compared with the Dutch B9 figures. 

2 One of the recommendations in the fifth report on human trafficking was that the registration of clients by the 
STV (as it was then called) should be improved. 

3 There were 716 notifications in 2007 (figures published from Comensha’s victim registration on 11 March 
2008).

from the figures in the STV’s annual reports.4 For some statistics reference is made to the 
annual reports. If so, it is explicitly stated. 

2.2.1 Country of origin 

Table 2.1 contains the rankings of the five most common countries of origin of victims of 
THB for each year.5

As in the two preceding years, the Netherlands was the most common country of origin of 
victims of THB. Nigeria, Bulgaria and Romania were ranked second, third and fourth, posi-
tions they have occupied, in different orders, for the last three years. The previously identi-
fied emergence of China as an important country of origin (STV Nieuws, 1, 2007) is re-
flected in that country’s entry as a newcomer in the top five in the table in fifth place. 

There are 55 different nationalities represented among the victims registered with Comen-
sha in 2006. Table 2.2 lists the most common nationalities.7 Appendix 4 (Table B2.2) con-
tains a complete list of all nationalities in alphabetical order. 

                                                                      
4 The BNRM received a STV database, which was naturally anonymous but could be broken down to individual 

victims, for the first time for 2006. This provided more insight into the limitations of the registration. Accord-
ing to Comensha, the data reported here are the correct ones (Comensha, e-mail communication). 

5 The most recent year determined the order in which the countries are listed in the table. 
6 Based on the nationality of the (possible) victims. 
7 A nationality is included if at least five victims were of that nationality in one or more of the years in the period 

from 2002 to 2006.

In 2006, 146 (25%) of the victims registered with Comensha were from the Netherlands. In 
that year there was an increase (in absolute and percentage terms) in the number of victims 
with Brazilian, Chinese, Nigerian and Polish nationality. There are still many victims from 
Bulgaria but their share of the total declined. India appeared in the list for the first time in 
2006 (7 victims). The growth in the number (and share) of victims with Moroccan and 
Czech nationality reported in 2004 and 2005 did not continue.

As in the preceding years, the majority of registered victims in 2006 were in the age group 
from 18 to 30 years. There was a striking increase in the number of registered under-age vic-
tims, particularly in the age group from 15 to 17 years. 

Of the 101 under-age victims whose age and nationality are known, 35 were Dutch, 32 were 
Nigerian, six were Chinese, six Sierra Leonean, five Bulgarian and four Romanian.8 The 
other under-age victims had 13 different nationalities.9 

2.2.3 Gender 

There were 30 men or boys among the 579 newly registered victims in 2006. Five of them 
were minors, two of whom were younger than 15. The countries of origin were – with the 
number of men or boys from that country between brackets - India (7), China (4), Bangla-
desh, Nigeria and Turkey (each 3), Congo (2), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Chile, Camer-
oon, Mauritania and Sierra Leone (one each). The country of origin of one man is not 
known. Five of the 30 men were employed in prostitution, the four Chinese men worked in 
the hospitality industry, but the largest number of cases (nine men) related to employment 
in agriculture and horticulture (STV Annual Report 2006, p.8). 

                                                                      
8 The proportion of under-age victims varies from 12 % (for Bulgarian and Romanian victims) to 37% (for Nige-

rian victims). 
9 Six under-age victims were of Congolese, Moroccan or Surinamese nationality (two each) and seven victims 

were Armenian, Italian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, Russian or Turkish respectively.

The number of reports of male victims was far greater in 2006 than in previous years and is 
still increasing.10 This is probably due to the increased attention being given to exploitation 
outside the sex industry and the launch of investigations into THB in other sectors. In 2005, 
the 424 newly registered victims included just two men, both of whom were exploited in 
prostitution. One man or boy was reported in 200411 and none in 2003. 

2.2.4 Place of residence 

Table 2.4 presents an overview of the place of residence of the victims registered in 2006 at 
the time they were reported.

Many of the victims reported to Comensha are – as far as is known – living independently at 
the time of registration, 15% are staying in some form of reception facility and a substantial 
proportion (13%) are in (aliens) detention. The latter category includes a relatively large pro-
portion of men: it covers 53% of the men compared with 11% of the women. The victims in 

                                                                      
10 49 men were registered in 2007 (figures published from Comensha’s victim registration on 11 March 2008). 
11 Oral communication from STV. 
12 ‘Aliens’ is placed between brackets, but this group consists mainly of people in aliens detention.  
13 This would include closed accommodation for a victim of a loverboy. 
14 In most cases the place of residence is not known, in some cases they are staying with parents. This latter option 

is in fact included as a separate category in the Comensha registration data for 2007 (information from Co-
mensha, by e-mail and verbally).

detention also seem to include a relatively large proportion of Nigerians (at least 26). And 20 
of the victims in detention (18 girls and 2 boys) are minors. 

2.2.5 Further background information about the victims 

In 2003 Comensha started using a computer system with various relevant (background) 
variables. After initial problems, from 2005 it should have had more information than pre-
viously about registered (possible) victims, but it is still proving difficult to retrieve this in-
formation, so that much of the information is still lacking for many clients in 2006. Never-
theless, it has again been decided to present some (background) characteristics that may be 
interesting. However, since the following figures and percentages have to be regarded as 
minima due to the absence of many statistics they are not compared with the data for 2005. 

Of the victims registered with Comensha in 2006 it is known that at least: 
– 73 of the 549 registered female victims (13%) have children. The children of 25 of them live 

with their mother in the Netherlands, the children of twelve victims live elsewhere in the 
Netherlands and those of 23 victims live in the country of origin. It is not known where the 
children of the other victims are living (Source: STV Annual Report 2006, p.8); 

– 14 of the (female) victims (3%) were pregnant at the time of registration, of whom two 
were under-age and 119 (22%) were not (this information is not known for the other 75%). 
A relatively large number of the Chinese women and girls were pregnant (3 out of 10); 

– 15 (4%) of the total of 579 victims used drugs, 156 (27%) did not (this is not known for the 
other 408 - 70%); 

– 35 victims (6%) were (also) exploited outside prostitution,15 387 (67%) were not (this not 
known for 157 - 27%); 

– 101 victims were offered a period for reflection. This represents 26% of the victims that are 
known not to have Dutch nationality. 144 victims (36%) were not offered a reflection pe-
riod and the information is not known for the other non-Dutch victims. 

– 49 victims availed of the reflection period. This represents 12% of the victims that are 
known not to have Dutch nationality. 

– 208 victims (36%) reported the crime and 101 (17%) did not. The reflection period had not 
expired for 52 victims and for the others it is not known whether they reported the crime.

15 This was in agriculture and horticulture (16 victims), the hospitality sectors (11 victims), household work (5 vic-

tims), ‘within the marriage’ (2 victims) and in abattoirs (1 victim).

2.3 Victims in the B9 

2.3.1 B9 applications and permit awards 

In 2006 the IND received 180 B9 applications and granted 150 permits. This is more than 
twice as many as in the previous year, representing an enormous increase. It concerns a spe-
cific category of victims/witness-reporters of THB, namely persons who are living illegally 
in the Netherlands and (are willing to) cooperate with the police and public prosecution ser-
vice. It is not possible to calculate a percentage of permit awards from these figures since B9 
applications are not all dealt with in the same year as the application. We refer to Appendix 2 
for an explanation of the research and some additional explanatory notes to the data.  

2.3.2 Age of persons with (application for) B9 

Table 2.5 presents the age distribution of victims/witnesses who applied for or received a B9 
in 2005 or 2006. 

Table 2.5 Age distribution of persons with (application for) B9 (2005 and 2006)

Total 77 100% 180 100% 61 100% 150 100% 

As in the preceding year, almost half of the persons for whom a B9 was requested or issued 
in 2006 were aged between 18 and 26. Given the sharp rise in the number of applications 
and awards in 2006, not surprisingly the absolute number of applications/awards increased 
in almost every age category. In percentage terms, the only substantial increase occurred in 
the 11-to-17 age group, while the proportion of applications/awards declined sharply among 
26-to-30 year-olds. In 2006, the applicants included 34 under-age persons and 27 under-age 
persons were awarded a B9 permit in the same year. Among the under-age persons, some 
children of victims and children of witnesses were also registered – incidentally and mistak-
enly – as B9 applicants. The youngest child, a boy, is probably the child of a victim. One of 
the 11-to 17 year-olds (also a boy) was probably also the child of a victim.

2.3.3 Gender of persons with (application for) B9 

The expected shift in the gender of the victims (more male victims) as a result of the expan-
sion of the article in the law on human trafficking does indeed seem to be transpiring. 
Whereas in 2005, the first year after the law was amended, almost all B9 applicants were 
women (96%), in 2006 11% of the applicants were men. The B9 awards show a similar trend: 
2% for men in 2005 and 11% in 2006 

2.3.4 Origin of persons with (application for) B9 

Table 2.6 contains an overview of the most common nationalities of victims and witnesses 
that were awarded or applied for a B9 permit.16 There is a table with a complete list of all na-
tionalities in Appendix 4 (Table B2.6).

In 2006 almost a quarter of the victims /witnesses of THB for whom a B9 residence permit 
was requested or issued had Nigerian nationality, which represents an enormous increase 
compared with the previous year. This places Nigeria at the top of the list of countries of 
origin of victims and witnesses ‘in the B9’. Romania ranks second in terms of applications 
and awards in 2006, followed by Bulgaria, which headed the list in 2005.17 

In Table 2.7 the victims/witnesses that were awarded or applied for B9 are classified accord-
ing to region of origin. In the table a distinction is made within Europe – where many of the 
victims come from – between countries that were member states of the EU in 1995, coun-
tries that were members of the EU in 2004 or were candidates for membership of the EU at

sessed that nationality in at least one of the years 2005 and 2006.

In both 2005 and 2006, the majority of the victims and witnesses for whom a B9 residence 
permit was requested or granted came from the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 
2007, Africa and non-EU countries in Eastern Europe. Africa’s share increased substantially 
in both absolute and percentage terms, while that of the non-EU countries in Eastern 
Europe declined, particularly in relative terms.  

2.3.5 Continued residence 

Many victims and witnesses wish to remain in the Netherlands on expiry of the B9.NRM3 As 
reported in the fifth report on trafficking in human beings, the IND’s contact persons for 
human trafficking received 34 applications for continued residence in 2006, of which – in 
first instance – equal numbers were accepted and rejected (17 and 17). 

2.4 Compensation 

The fifth report on trafficking in human beings described the various methods by which vic-
tims of human trafficking can secure compensation for material or immaterial damage. One 
way for the victim is to join the criminal prosecution as an injured party. The victim’s civil 
claim is then handled concurrently with the criminal case. The court can, in addition to 
awarding the civil claim, also impose a compensation order. The victim can ask for this, but 
the court can also impose this sanction ex officio. In imposing a sentence the court can also

attach a special condition that a sum of money has to be paid to the Criminal Injuries Com-
pensation Fund (Schadefonds Geweldsmisdrijven) or to another institution that represents the 
interests of victims of crimes. Victims can also make a claim on the Criminal Injuries Com-
pensation Fund,19 avail of mediation on the issue of compensation – although this is not an 
obvious option given the nature of the crime – or institute proceedings for compensation in 
civil court. 

Data from the public prosecution service provide (some) information about the decisions 
on compensation in criminal and civil law cases. Before presenting them, Table 2.8 first pro-
vides an overview of the number of perpetrators that were convicted of human trafficking 
(alone or in combination with other offences)20 in the period 2003 to 2006 and the sentences 
they received (for more detailed information about this, see chapter 4, table 4.8).

19 In 2007, 25 applications were made to the fund by victims of human trafficking and 18 applications were 

awarded. 
20 In other words, cases in which charges of human trafficking were brought but there was no conviction are ig-

nored. 
21 These are unconditional sentences. 



VICTIMS 

 17 

Although no compensation was awarded in more than half of the cases in 2006 in which de-
fendants were convicted of human trafficking, there is clearly an upward trend in the sense 
that it is an issue that the criminal courts are being asked to decide on increasingly fre-
quently. This most frequently results in an order to pay compensation or in an order to pay 
compensation measure combined with the (partial) award of a civil claim. It has to be real-
ised however that this refers to the number of cases in which such judgments are rendered. 
The judgments can relate to more than one victim and vary with respect to different vic-
tims.22 

It is not known how many victims actually received compensation on the basis of the above 
judgments nor what may have been (solely or additionally) claimed (and received) through 
the other channels of compensation. 
 

                                                                      
22 When there is a rejection/declaration of non-admissibility (with respect to a particular victim) and an order to 

pay compensation, a (partial) award of a civil claim or a combination of both (with respect to one or more other 
victims), the judgment is classified one of these last three categories.

 Suspects and convicted offenders 

3.1 Introduction 

This chapter contains statistics about persons suspected of THB whose prosecution for 
THB was registered with the public prosecution services (PPS). The number fluctuates from 
year to year and there were 201 in 2006. This chapter also contains data about offenders 
convicted of THB in first instance. This number also fluctuates from year to year and there 
were 70 in 2006. The information relates to their age, gender and country of origin. The in-
formation about the suspects covers the period from 2002 to 2006 and the data about con-
victed offenders cover the period from 2003 (the first year for which these data were avail-
able) to 2006. The information comes from the PPS database. 

3.2 Age

Table 3.1 provides an overview of the ages of suspects registered with the PPS, broken down

In almost 70% of the cases registered in 2006 the suspects were aged between 18 and 41 at 
the time of the first offence of THB.1 The average age of the suspects was 32 (SD 11.4) and

eleven suspects were minors (5%), which is more than in previous years in both absolute and 
relative terms.  
Over the entire period from 2002 to 2006 the average age of the suspects was also 32 
(SD 10.9). The female suspects were on average slightly younger: 29 (SD 10.8). 

3.2.2 Age of convicted offenders 

Table 3.2 contains similar information about the age (at the time of the crime) of the persons 
convicted in first instance of THB in the period 2003 to 2006. It is important to note here that 
the year in which an offence is registered by the PPS is not always the same year as the court 
renders its verdict. For that reason, the figures in the tables for registered and convicted per-
sons do not relate to precisely the same persons. In theory, for example, there may be more 
convictions of under-age offenders than registered suspects who were under-age at the time 
of the offence in a particular year.

time of the first offence and four of the convicted offenders (6%) in that year were minors at 
the time of the offence. 

3.3 Country of origin 

3.3.1 Country of origin of suspects 

Over the entire period from 2002 to 2006, the suspects came from 55 different countries. In 
each of the years between 2002 and 2005 the suspects came from 20 or more different coun-
tries. In this respect, 2006 surpasses every other year with suspects from 32 different coun-
tries of birth.

3 The criterion used for inclusion in this table is that at least five suspects came from the country concerned in 

one of the years between 2002 to 2006 or at least ten came from that country in the entire period. The figures 
for the years 2002 to 2005 differ slightly from those in earlier reports due to corrections in PPS data. Since the 
discrepancies are minor, they are not illuminated any further.

As in preceding years, the Netherlands was the most common country of origin of suspects 
registered by the PPS.5 Turkey, Morocco, Bulgaria and Romania also stand out as being rela-
tively frequently the country of birth of suspects (more than 5% of the cases). India is a strik-
ing newcomer in the list. Reviewing the entire period from 2002 to 2006, besides the large 
proportion of Dutch suspects, there are also large percentages of suspects born in Turkey, 
Bulgaria and Romania. Albania no longer seems important in this regard and the signifi-
cance of Nigeria seems to be declining, although the reports of (arrests in) THB cases at the 
end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 raise the suspicion that this impression of Nigeria’s 
position as a country of origin of suspects may change again. 

3.3.2 Country of origin of convicted offenders 

The previous section concerned the countries of birth of suspects of THB registered with the 
PPS. Table 3.5 contains a list of the five most common countries of birth of persons convicted 
of THB in the period from 2003 to 2006.6

As in preceding years, the Netherlands was the most common country of birth of persons 
convicted of THB in 2006.8 As in the case of registered suspects, the former Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary are relatively common countries of birth of convicted offenders, together with 
Morocco, Turkey and Bulgaria. Over the entire period from 2003 to 2006, in addition to the 
fact that the overwhelming majority of convicted offenders are Dutch, a striking feature is 
the proportion of convicted offenders who were born in Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and 
Morocco, although the number of convictions of Bulgarians, Romanians and – to a lesser 
extent – Turks does seem to be declining.  

3.4 Gender 

3.4.1 Gender of suspects 

Most suspects are male; in 2006 they accounted for 83% of the total. The 32 female suspects 
registered by the PPS came from Bulgaria, Romania, the (former) Soviet Union (each 5), the 
Netherlands (4), Morocco (3) and Brazil, Hungary, Hong Kong, India, Iran, (former) Yugo-
slavia, Lithuania, Nigeria, Poland and (former) Czechoslovakia (each 1).  
There are clear differences between the countries of origin. Confining ourselves to the main 
countries of origin of suspects listed in Table 3.4, what stands out is that the Turkish suspects 
do not include any women and that there are few women among the Dutch suspects (5%), 
while 38% and 36% respectively of the Bulgarian and Romanian suspects are women. 
Whereas it was observed in the previous report that scarcely any of the Moroccan suspects 
were women (not more than 2 to 3% measured over the previous five years), the figure in 
2006 was 23% (3 of the 13 suspects were women). 

Although Nigeria is no longer significant as a country of origin of suspects registered with 
the PPS, the number of women among Nigerian suspects is worthy of mention: of the 18 
suspects registered in the period 2002 to 2006, 78% were women. 

                                                                      
8 Convicted persons are not registered on the basis of ethnic background.

3.4.2 Gender of convicted offenders 

A review of the convictions for THB in 2006 shows that 13 of the 70 persons convicted – in 
first instance – were women. That is 19%, which is slightly more than the year before, but 
similar to the situation in 2003 and 2004.9 These 13 women came from the Netherlands, Mo-
rocco, Romania and (former) Czechoslovakia (each 2) and Bulgaria, Great Britain, Hungary, 
Poland and Thailand (each 1). There are stark differences between countries in terms of the 
proportion of women among the convicted offenders. For the eight countries which ac-
counted for more than ten convicted offenders in the period from 2003 to 2006, the per-
centage ranges from 0% (Albania) to 35% (former Soviet Union).10 
 
 

                                                                      
9 Convictions of women for THB: 13 in 2003 (16%), 21 in 2004 (18%) and 10 in 2005 (12%). 
10 The proportion of women among the persons convicted of THB from the other six countries is 3% (Turkey), 

8% (Netherlands and Morocco), 17% (Surinam), 23% (Bulgaria) and 29% (Romania).

 Prosecution 

4.1 Introduction 

This chapter presents the results of (secondary) analyses of the trafficking in human beings 
(THB) cases in the public prosecution service (PPS) database for the period 2002 to 2006.1 
For each year, the number of cases registered with the PPS, handled by the PPS and dis-
posed of by the courts is given. In other words, no cohort was followed. The research 
method is explained in Appendix 2.  

With the entry into force of Article 273a of the Netherlands Criminal Code on 1 January 
2005 – renumbered without amendment of the text as Article 273f of the Code in mid-2005 
– exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry and certain activities relating to the re-
moval of organs were also brought within the definition of ‘human trafficking’. Unfortu-
nately, the text of the article makes it impossible to give an indication – within the PPS data – of 
the nature of the exploitation on the basis of the sections and subsections of the article (in the 
sex industry, in other economic sectors or in relation to the disposal of organs). What we do 
know is that all cases up to the end of 2005 relate to exploitation in the sex industry, and that 
several cases in 2006 involve exploitation in other sectors. None of the cases relate to the 
removal of organs. 

4.2 THB cases registered with the Public Prosecution Service 

4.2.1 Number of registered cases 

In 2006, 201 cases were registered with the PPS in which human trafficking was (solely or 
also) suspected (Article 250ter (old), Article 250a (old), Article 273a (old) or Article 273f).2 In 
the context of prosecution, a (criminal) case is understood to mean a case against a single 
suspect. 

Table 4.1 shows how many cases there were in each year and (as far as is known) how many 
of these cases (also) involved under-age victims.3 

                                                                      
1 These were again performed for this report by the Statistical Data and Policy Analysis Division (SIBA) of the 

Ministry of Justice’s Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (WODC). 
2 Including cases that were later dropped by the PPS or in which the charges did not ultimately include THB. 
3 Criterion: registration under sections and subsections of the article which imply that the victims were under-age.

2005 138 36 26% 

2006 201 24 12% 

The number of registered cases fluctuates: the small numbers of registered cases in 2003 and 
2005 were followed by substantial numbers of cases in 2004 and 2006. 
The number of cases that (also) involve under-age victims also fluctuates: in both absolute 
and relative terms, the number declined in 2004, increased in 2005 and fell again in 2006. 
Over the entire period from 2002 to 2006, at least4 17% of all cases solely or also involved 
under-age victims. This says nothing about the total number of under-age victims, since there 
may be more than one involved in each case. 

4.2.2 ‘Nature’ of the cases 

Breaking down the THB cases registered with the PPS according to the different sections 
within the articles on human trafficking in the Criminal Code5 produces the results shown in 
Table 4.2.

4 Under-age victims may also be involved in cases registered under sections and subsections of the article other 

than those referred to in an earlier footnote. 
5 Perhaps superfluously: registration, summons or conviction under Article 273f section 3, 4, 5 or 6 concerns the 

aggravating circumstances under which THB is committed (Article 273f section 1). 
6 Article 250ter/a section 3, Article 273a, section 5 and Article 273a/f section 6 are not mentioned in the table be-

cause there were no cases under those provisions in the period concerned. 



PROSECUTION 

 29 

The vast majority of the THB cases in the period 2002 to 2006 concerned aggravated human 
trafficking: these are cases in which two or more persons act in concert or there is a victim 
who is younger than 16 years of age or serious physical injury is inflicted. Non-aggravated 
human trafficking also occurred fairly frequently in that period. In 2005 and 2006, five cases 
were registered under Article 273a/f, section 4 (THB committed by two or more persons act-
ing in concert, in which there was also a victim younger than 16 involved) and two cases were 
registered in 2006 under Article 273f, section 5 (human trafficking resulting in serious physi-
cal injury). 

The offence of THB is often committed in combination with other offences.7 A case may 
therefore involve more than one offence. 

Table 4.3 provides an overview of the most serious registered offences in each THB case.8

In the last few years, THB was the only, or the most serious offence, in around 80% of the 
cases. In most of the cases in which there was another, more serious offence in addition to 

                                                                      
7 Such as arranging entry to the country for an illegal alien, (attempted) rape or complicity therein, possession or 

use of weapons, (attempted) intentional deprivation of liberty or complicity therein and offences relating to 
drugs, the production and use of false or forged travel documents and assault and duress.NRM3, NRM5 

8 The classification adopted by Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek), in which the offence 
with the most severe potential punishment ‘prevails’, has been modified by creating a separate category for 
THB. Where there are combinations of offences with equal punishments, THB is included in the list as the 
most serious offence. If there are then still several offences with the same potential punishment, whichever of-
fence was committed earlier prevails. 

9 They involve, for example, (THB in combination with) fraud, bribery of a public official, making a false charge, 
bigamy, inducing a minor to drunkenness or abducting a minor.NRM3 



TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS – SIXTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 30 

THB, that offence usually involved a form of sexual violence. In 2006, sexual violence was 
the most serious offence in 18% of cases involving THB. 
Whereas the previous report identified a – gradual – decline in the (registration of) THB in 
combination with ‘participation in a criminal organisation’ (Article 140 of the Criminal 
Code), to the point where it did not occur at all in 2005, that combination did occur again in 
2006 on 29 occasions (in 14% of the cases). It would therefore appear that resources are not - 
or no longer - being devoted mainly to cases designed to deliver a ‘short, sharp blow’ to per-
petrators and relating to suspects operating on their own, a possible explanation that was 
put forward as a point of concern in the last report. 

4.3 Cases dealt with by the Public Prosecution Service 

Table 4.4 contains an overview of the number of cases, by year of registration, in which the 
suspect was remanded in custody. 

Table 4.4 Remand in custody, by year of registration10

Total 200 100% 156 100% 220 100% 138 100% 201 100% 

In 2006, more than three-quarters of the suspects were on remand at the time their case was 
brought before the court. This percentage has remained reasonably stable over the years. 

The previous sections involved cases registered with the PPS. Table 4.5 covers the cases 
dealt with by the PPS in those same years.11 

                                                                      
10 Here too there are minor discrepancies compared with the figures presented in the previous report. 
11 The reason why more cases were dealt with by the PPS than were registered with the PPS in 2006 is that no 

cohort was followed and the PPS does not always make a decision on whether to prosecute in the same year as 
a case is registered. Once again, there are (minor) discrepancies in this table compared with figures presented in 
previous reports.

The number of cases dealt with by the PPS displays a similar pattern to the number of cases 
registered with the PPS: 2004 was a peak year with 246 cases dealt with. That was followed 
by a relative trough in 2005 with only 138 cases dealt with, whereupon the PPS handled a 
substantially larger number of cases in 2006. 
As in previous years, the issuing of a summons was by far the most common manner in 
which cases were handled in 2006 (in 80% of the cases in 2006). Most summonses were is-
sued solely or jointly for THB, some exclusively for other offences. The number of cases in 
which an unconditional decision was taken not to prosecute declined slightly to 19% of the 
cases in 2006. The decisions were based mainly on technical grounds, the most common 
reason being ‘a lack of evidence’. 
Prosecutions were unconditionally dropped more often in cases where non-aggravated 
THB was suspected than in cases where there were aggravating circumstances.18 

                                                                      
12 This refers to a summons solely or jointly for THB. 
13 These are cases in which, despite an earlier suspicion of (and registration under) THB, the summons ultimately 

did not include a charge of THB but did include charges of one or more other criminal offences. 
14 To another district or another country. 
15 Joinder is the merging of different criminal offences into a single case. 
16 A conditional decision not to prosecute is a provisional postponement by the PPS of the decision on whether to 

prosecute. 
17 An out-of-court settlement involves the (voluntary) payment of a sum of money to the PPS, whereupon the 

PPS abstains from prosecuting. 
18 In 2006, non-aggravated: 64% summonses for THB and 26% unconditional decisions not to prosecute; aggra-

vated: 81% summonses for THB and 15% unconditional decisions not to prosecute.

4.4 Settlement by the court 

To recapitulate: in 2006 there were 201 cases registered with the PPS in which there was a 
suspicion of THB. In that same year, the PPS dealt with 216 cases and the courts dealt (in first 
instance) with 100 cases in which the charges included THB.19 

Table 4.6 give an overview of the judicial decisions, by year in which the case was settled.

Once again, a large majority of the cases brought to court in 2006 led to a conviction (90%). 
In 10% of the cases there was an acquittal. The other forms of settlement did not occur at all 
in 2006 and only occasionally in the preceding years.

4.4.2 Conviction for THB 

Sentences imposed 
Table 4.8 contains an overview of the sentences imposed in the cases in which the suspects 
were (also) convicted of THB. In other words, cases in which a summons was served but 
there was no conviction for THB are ignored.21

21 That happened in 20 (22%) of the 90 cases in 2006 in which the summons did include THB and which resulted 

in a conviction. 
22 In this table there are also discrepancies compared with the figures presented in previous reports. Some of 

them are substantial. 
23 These are unconditional sentences, unless otherwise stated. 
24 An additional sentence may be imposed (for example, confiscation) or a measure (for example, detention under 

a hospital order). Contrary to what the term suggests, the court can impose only an ‘additional’ sentence (Arti-
cle 9 section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). 

25 The combination of a custodial sentence and a community service order is included in the category ‘custodial 
sentence’. This combination was imposed three times in the period 2002 to 2006.  

26 Combinations of a custodial sentence and a fine or a community service order are included in the category ‘cus-
todial sentence’. These combinations were imposed eight and twelve times respectively in the period 2002 to 
2006. 

27 The combination of a community service order and a fine is included in the category ‘community service’. This 
combination was imposed four times in the period 2002 to 2004. 

28 The combination of a custodial sentence and a community service order is included in the category ‘custodial 
sentence’ and was imposed once (in 2006).

Custodial sentences 
In 2006, unconditional custodial sentences were imposed in 63 (90%) of the aforemen-
tioned 70 THB cases, 23 times in combination with an (unconditional) community service 
order or fine.  
The average term of the custodial sentence in 2006 ranged from just over 9 months (285 
days, SD 114) for a conviction under Article 273a/f section 4 (an offence committed in con-
cert) to roughly 22 months (669 days, SD 486) for a conviction under Article 250ter/a sec-
tion 2 (under-age victims). 

Perhaps more revealing is Table 4.9, which shows the terms of custodial sentences broken 
down into different categories. Percentages are only given where the subtotals are 20 or 
more.

29 The combination of a community service order and a fine is included in the category ‘community service’ and 

was imposed once (in 2006). 
30 This is a sentence of life imprisonment (for murder, rape and other sexual offences in combination with THB).

In 2006 almost half of the custodial sentences imposed in first instance were for less than 
one year.  

The table above relates to convictions for THB. Reviewing the most serious offence for 
which an offender was convicted, as in previous years the highest average custodial sentence 
in 2006 was imposed where violence was the most serious offence: 832 days (SD 678), or 
just over 27 months.31 

4.5 Appeal? 

The PPS data only contain information about the settlement of cases in first instance. It is 
also known whether an appeal was lodged in a case, and by whom. Table 4.10 provides an 
overview.32 

                                                                      
31 This involves five cases in all. 
32 Here too there are (minor) discrepancies compared with figures in the previous reports.

The table shows that an appeal was lodged in 43% of the cases in 2006, most often by 
the suspect, either exclusively or as well as the public prosecutor.33 The percentage fluc-
tuates slightly over the years. 

                                                                      
33 The suspect – naturally – does so in the event of a conviction, the public prosecutor does so most frequently in 

the event of an acquittal.

Appendix 2 
 Explanation of the research methods 

BNRM collects information in a variety of ways. This appendix briefly explains the research 
methods used. 

1 The B9 research 

Objective and research questions 
In principle, every year BNRM analyses the files provided by the Immigration and Naturali-
sation Service containing records of all the applications for and awards of residence permits 
under the B9 regulation (B9 residence permits). 

The research questions are: 
– For how many victims /witnesses was a B9 residence permit applied for? 
– To how many victims /witnesses was a B9 residence permit granted? 
– What are the (background) characteristics of persons who were granted a B9 residence 

permit? 

Research method 
At BNRM’s request, the IND – the agency to which applications for residence permits un-
der the B9 regulation are submitted – supplies files with records of all contacts with persons 
between 2001 and 2006 in which the B9 regulation played a role. In other words, these files 
contain records of all applications for B9 residence permits (initial applications and applica-
tions for an extension), as well as all decisions to approve applications (even if they were 
made later, for example after an objection or appeal procedure and/or the extension of a 
residence permit on other grounds). BNRM aggregated and consolidated all the files at a 
personal level. For various reasons that are explained in the fifth report on human traffick-
ingNRM5, this report (in Chapter 2) only covers the years 2005 and 2006.  
Where they are relevant, reference is made to the results for the period up to 2002, as pub-
lished in the 3rd report of the NRM. For the classification by year, as before the automati-
cally assigned and therefore reliable ‘entry date’ is used. 

Reservations concerning the research 
The B9 data only relate to victims and witnesses of THB living illegally in the Netherlands. 
After all, it is only for them that it is necessary to suspend deportation pending the investiga-
tion and prosecution. The regulation provides for a temporary residence permit for both 
foreign victims and foreign witnesses who report human trafficking or have otherwise co-
operated in an investigation and prosecution. The IND does not register whether a person 
received a B9 residence permit as a victim or as a witness.  



TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS – SIXTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 44 

2 The PPS data research 

Introducion 
At BNRM’s request, analyses are carried out each year on part of the PPS national database 
devoted to ‘human trafficking’, which contains information provided by 19 district offices of 
the PPS about the prosecution of suspects.1 The analyses give an impression of the course of 
the proceedings in first instance. PPS data contain information about cases and offences. By 
contrast with police investigations, for the purpose of prosecution a (criminal) case is under-
stood to mean the case against a single suspect. Criminal cases against individual suspects 
may involve multiple offences. The results of the research are presented in Chapter 3 (Sus-
pects and convicted offenders) and Chapter 4 (Prosecution). 

Objective and research questions 
The objective of the study was to provide insight into the prosecution of suspects of THB in 
the Netherlands. The research questions were: 
– How many cases relating to THB were registered with the PPS in 2006? 
– How often are under-age victims involved? 
– What is the breakdown of the suspects in terms of gender, age and country of origin? 
– What is the breakdown of persons convicted of THB in terms of gender, age and country 

of origin? 
– What offences other than THB are those persons suspected of? 
– How did the PPS deal with cases in 2006? 
– How did the courts settle cases in 2006? 
– How often do the various parties lodge an appeal against judgments of the court? 
– What trends have occurred over time with respect to THB? 

Research method 
The cases in which THB is registered (as one of the offences) were selected from the overall 
PPS database. The analyses do not follow a particular cohort. Instead, the analysis reviewed 
how many cases were registered and how many were dealt with by the PPS or settled by the 
courts.2 

Additional remarks 
The PPS data only include the principal charges in the indictment. Furthermore, if there are 
several principal offences in the charges only the first offence is registered in the PPS data. 
This means not only that the PPS data provide only a limited impression of the total number 
of THB offences (namely that portion that comes to the attention of the police and is re-
ferred to the PPS) but also that the portion of the information that does reach the PPS and 

                                                                      
1 The analyses are carried out by the Statistical Data and Policy Analysis Division (SIBA) of the Ministry of Jus-

tice’s Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (WODC). 
2 This means that they are not necessarily always the same cases.

that may play a role in the course of the prosecution is not to be found in the PPS data. It is 
not known how much information may be lost in this way.

Appendix 3 
 Notes to tables and statistics 

1 Notes to tables 

This report contains a number of tables. These notes contain some remarks that are impor-
tant for the interpretation of the tables. 

Due to rounding off, the tables do not always come to precisely 100%. To make the tables 
easier to read, however, the totals are always given as 100%. 
If numbers are given in a column, the letter N is used at the top of that column to denote 
the word ‘number’. 
In the tables a dash (-) is used to indicate that the number is zero and that the associated per-
centage is 0%. When the number is higher than zero, but the percentage after rounding off is 
0%, 0% is used instead of a dash. 

2 Notes to the statistics used 

Averages are sometimes given in this report, for example the average age of suspects in THB 
cases registered with the PPS. In that case, the number (N, see above) and the standard de-
viation (SD) are also often given. The standard deviation expresses the extent to which the 
numbers over which the average is calculated differ. The higher the standard deviation, the 
more they vary.
