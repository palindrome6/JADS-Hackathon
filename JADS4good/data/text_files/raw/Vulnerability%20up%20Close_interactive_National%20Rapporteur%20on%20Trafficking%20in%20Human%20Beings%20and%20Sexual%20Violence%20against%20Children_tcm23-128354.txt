  Foreword

Essentially, human trafficking is the abuse of a person’s vulnerable position for purely personal gain. In 
this report, I analyse abuse of the vulnerability of children. Of the many children fleeing from conflict 
zones around the world, of children who grow up in poverty and who work from a young age making 
products for our market, and children who happen to belong to a minority group and whose marginal-
ized position makes them ill-equipped to defend themselves against abusers. Although these children 
are not all victims of human trafficking, the question of what factors make some more vulnerable than 
others is more pressing than ever, since it is not only the direct victims of human trafficking who suffer, 
but also their parents, families and friends.

Gathering information about the factors that make children vulnerable is essential to efforts to prevent 
and combat their exploitation. That knowledge is crucial in order to correctly identify the groups that 
need protection. There is international agreement that measures should be taken to address the factors 
that make children vulnerable and it must not be left at good intentions. As long as we as a society are 
incapable of recognizing that thirteen-year-old Roma children who steal are possible victims of human 
trafficking, and instead see them as criminals, we are failing them. Whereas these children currently face 
the threat of prosecution, they actually need our protection. And what about Syrian child brides who 
come to the Netherlands? My concern is that some of these girls disappear out of sight behind the front 
door of their home, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Like every child in the Netherlands, these 
girls are entitled to enjoy the liberating power of our values.

These and other groups of children who could be vulnerable to human trafficking are the focus of this 
study. A study that differs from what you are accustomed to from me in that its primary purpose is not 
to contribute to the monitoring of existing policy in relation to human trafficking, but rather to explore 
the phenomenon from the perspective of human trafficking and sexual violence against children in 
order to determine whether there is cause for concern. For this report, I have selected seven groups of 
children that have recently been mentioned in relation to trafficking in human beings and investigate 
whether there is evidence of their potential vulnerability.

The multiplicity of forms that human trafficking has assumed in recent years highlights the fact that we 
have to remain alert to the emergence of new manifestations of the offence. This is particularly true 
where minors are involved. Take, for example, the reports of the possible exploitation of Eritrean chil-
dren during their journey to Europe or of Vietnamese children disappearing from shelters [in the Neth-
erlands?] and possibly being forced to work in cannabis plantations. We must remain constantly alert 
to human trafficking, maintain the capacity and willingness to examine new and existing phenomena 



from the perspective of human trafficking and, by increasing public awareness, enhance society’s resil-
ience against human trafficking.

Numerous individuals and agencies helped in the writing of this report. I would also like to thank the 
many people who were willing to read and comment on it and the staff of my office for their efforts. I 
would especially like to mention the contribution by Sjoerd van Bemmel.

1 Introduction

1.1 The expansion of the concept of human trafficking

A young boy aged twelve who sets up his uncle’s stall every morning; an eight-year-old girl who begs on 
the street; a boy of fourteen who steals under the watchful eye of his grandfather. These examples could 
all have one thing in common: human trafficking. Few people are likely to have considered examples 
like these at the time the international definition of human traffick-
ing1 was first formulated in 2000, and even the legislature could not 
have anticipated the myriad guises that human trafficking could 
take in the Netherlands, including forms of exploitation outside the 
sex industry.2

The definition of human trafficking has expanded in the last few 
decades. In addition to the growing attention to forms of exploita-
tion outside the sex industry, in recent years the spotlight has also 
turned to child victims of human trafficking. Greater awareness of 
human trafficking, fostered at every level of government, has cre-
ated a clearer picture of where human trafficking occurs and the 
forms it takes, but has also presented the Netherlands with a sad 
reality. Human trafficking is far more prevalent in our society than 
could have been imagined almost two decades ago. New forms are 
emerging, many of them involving underage victims. These cases 
are a particular source of concern, since children can be regarded as 
inherently vulnerable to human trafficking. They are, by definition, 
dependent on adults, and we must therefore remain particularly 
alert to human trafficking involving minors, especially forms of human trafficking with which we have 
had little or no experience.

‘Right now, there’s a young boy, in a brick fac-
tory, covered in dust, hauling his heavy load 
under a blazing sun, thinking if he could just go 
to school, he might know a different future, but 
he doesn’t think anybody is paying attention. 
Right now, there is a girl, somewhere trapped in 
a brothel, crying herself to sleep again, and 
maybe daring to imagine that some day, just 
maybe, she might be treated not like a piece of 
property, but as a human being. And so our mes-
sage today, to them, is – to the millions around 
the world – we see you. We hear you. We insist 
on your dignity. And we share your belief that if 
just given the chance, you will forge a life equal 
to your talents and Worthy of your dreams‘  
[Barack Obama, 25 september 2012].

Vulnerability up Close

That is the context in which the publication of this report has to be seen. This initial exploratory 
study concerns groups of children3 about whom there have recently been reports of human trafficking, 
but who have received little attention in relation to it. Seven specific groups have been selected. It is not 
a random selection; the groups have been chosen because they have been mentioned in other explora-
tory studies, in cases before the courts and in media reports or in warnings that have reached the Na-
tional Rapporteur from professionals in the field. In light of the exploratory nature of this study, it was 
decided to adopt a low threshold for the inclusion of particular groups, so further research was carried 
out even if the information about the relationship between these groups and human trafficking was 
sparse.

The seven groups covered in this analysis are:
• Syrian child brides;
• Roma children;
• Children living illegally in the country who have to work in households;
• Children working in production chains;
• Children with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa;
• Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children;
• Children who join (or wish to join) ISIS.

This report focuses primarily on human trafficking, but since the National Rapporteur’s mandate also 
extends to sexual violence against children, it also addresses children’s vulnerability to sexual violence. 
It is suspected, or is likely given the nature of human trafficking, that in some cases the possible exploi-
tation is preceded or accompanied by sexual violence.

1.2 Vulnerability 

There is no clear, uniform definition of vulnerability in the context of human trafficking.4 The term 
‘vulnerability’ in this sense was first used in 2000, in the Palermo 
Protocol,5 where ‘abuse of a position of vulnerability’ is defined 
as one of the means by which a person can be trafficked. The term 
has since also been used in most of the principal international 
instruments relating to the suppression of human trafficking.6 
Generally speaking, vulnerability in this context refers to a person 
or group’s heightened susceptibility to becoming a victim7 due to 
factors that can be exploited by a trafficker.8 This automatically 

3 In this study, children are persons below the age of eighteen. The term ‘youths’ or ‘young people’ refers to underage 
youths, unless otherwise stated. ‘Minors’ is used as a synonym for children.

and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision

‘I have come to understand trafficking as sys-
tematic exploitation of vulnerabilities. How-
ever, these vulnerabilities create an arena that 
makes exploitation possible, and one that traf-
fickers can manipulate to keep their victims in a 
situation where continued exploitation is pos-
sible’ [Tyldum, 2011].

implies that the existence of factors that make a person or group vulnerable does not, by definition, lead 
to their victimization.9 In addition to factors that cause vulnerability, there are other, protective factors 
that can influence a person’s vulnerability, such as a close family, strong ties to the local community and 
the existence of effective policies to preventing victimization.10

In various international legal instruments the term ‘vulnerability’ is used in combination with the 
stipulation of obligations to adopt measures to prevent human trafficking. The Palermo Protocol and 
the EU Human Trafficking Directive,11 for example, explicitly stress the importance of providing informa-
tion and advice for vulnerable groups. It is therefore essential to know what it is that makes a particular 
group of persons, in this case children, vulnerable.12

To gain a clearer understanding of the factors that can make children vulnerable to human trafficking, 
this study adopts the ‘clusters’ of vulnerability introduced by the Eu-
ropean Commission, namely (1) individual vulnerability, (2) familial 
vulnerability, (3) socio-economic vulnerability and (4) structural vul-
nerability. The factors affecting individual vulnerability are connect-
ed with the child’s personal situation and history. Past abuse, for 
example, increases the likelihood of a child becoming a victim of 
human trafficking, as does impaired cognitive and emotional devel-
opment. Other factors that can increase the risk of a child becoming 
a victim of human trafficking are an unstable family situation or poor financial management in the 
household (familial) or membership of a marginalized population group and lack of access to care and 
justice (socio-economic). Finally, an example of structural vulnerability is the absence of a government that is 
adequately equipped to identify vulnerability and to provide protection to children who become or could 
become victims of human trafficking.

The classification adopted by the European Commission is idealistic in nature. In practice, it is not 
easy to determine a child’s vulnerability on the basis of these four clusters, since it is difficult to evaluate 
risk factors in isolation. They influence and can reinforce one another. However, the European Commis-
sion’s clusters do provide a clear conceptual design for reflecting on the various factors that influence a 
person’s vulnerability. Accordingly, the summaries preceding the analyses of the seven groups covered in 
this report are based on those clusters.

10 Protective factors are essentially the mirror image of risk factors; i.e., factors that make children less vulnerable to 

human trafficking (also referred to as resilience factors). Given the scope of this report, the National Rapporteur has 
confined the analysis to factors that make children vulnerable.

replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA of 5 April 2011, OJ 2011, L 101/1.

12 The European Commission carried out its study in preparation for the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Traf-
ficking in Human Beings 2012 – 2016. To investigate the factors contributing to vulnerability, in-depth interviews 
were conducted in various member states and stakeholders at European level were also interviewed. Stakeholders 
from the 28 member states then discussed a detailed list of possible risk factors. Finally, professionals who work with 
child victims of human trafficking were asked to comment on a new list and to present evidence and concrete exam-
ples to substantiate the risk factors. The research did not in fact only cover factors that make children vulnerable, 
but also protective factors (European Commission, 2015: p. 27).

‘[…] the extent to which a child is vulnerable 
to trafficking is only rarely determined by one 
particular factor. Rather, children are usually 
exposed to a combination of circumstances 
which result in them becoming victims of 
trafficking’ [Europese Commissie, 2015].

1.3 Research questions

The seven groups discussed in this study have all recently been mentioned in connection with human traf-
ficking and have been analysed in order to gain greater insight into their vulnerability. With a better under-
standing of their vulnerability, it could ultimately be possible to take the correct measures to prevent the 
members of these groups from becoming victims of human trafficking. Accordingly, the key objective of 
this report is:

to acquire insight into vulnerability with the aim of improving efforts to address the factors lead-
ing to vulnerability and ultimately preventing and combating the exploitation of children.

To learn more about the vulnerability to human trafficking of the groups covered in this report, two 
specific questions were addressed:

(1) To what extent is there evidence that these groups of children are vulnerable to human traffickers?
(2) To what extent is there evidence that human traffickers specifically target these groups?

For the sake of clarity, the answers to these two questions are presented in accordance with the model 
shown in figure 1.

Introduction
15

The model in figure 1 comprises four categories. The extent to which groups are vulnerable and human 
traffickers actively target them is expressed by the ‘scores’ of strong or weak. In Chapter 6 each of the 
groups is assigned to one of the categories on the basis of the exploratory analysis, which shows wheth-
er, and to what extent, the group that was discussed is vulnerable and whether any actual evidence has 
been found that human traffickers target them. The classification in this diagram helps to identify what 
further steps need to be taken. The nature of the follow-up measures depends on the extent of a particu-
lar group’s vulnerability and on whether human traffickers actually target it. As regards a group whose 
score is ‘strong’ on both scales, the response should logically take the form of concrete measures. If 
there is no evidence of actual victimization, but the members of the group are very vulnerable, further 
investigation is needed into whether additional research is required or whether preventive measures 
need to be taken to prevent human traffickers from exploiting the identified risk factors in the future.

The descriptions of each of the seven groups are preceded by concise answers to the two research 
questions, together with the category in the diagram to which the group has been assigned. The analyses 
of each individual group are followed by an overarching analysis in Chapter 6, in which the above mod-
el is used to compare the seven groups and to show at a glance which groups of children should receive 
priority. This overall analysis also includes a brief explanation of the reasons for assigning a group to a 
particular category and explains what further action could and should be taken.

1.4 Constraints

The principal constraint in this report is that the subjects discussed in the following chapters are not 
covered exhaustively. That fact immediately indicates the limited pretence of this report, the purpose of 
which is to draw attention to groups of children that might be vulnerable to human trafficking and to 
guard against what Chuang calls exploitation creep13 (the steady expansion of the definition of the con-
cept of human trafficking by extending it to include phenomena that cannot realistically be compre-
hended under the term). It sometimes seems to be assumed that the concept of human trafficking is 
unlimited, the ultimate effect of which is to deprive the concept of its authority and undermine the ef-
fectiveness of efforts to combat it. In that respect, investigating vulnerable groups requires a balancing 
act. On the one hand, it is important, and even essential, to be alert to current developments in society 
that could be linked to human trafficking. On the other, it has to be realized that there are limits to the 
concept.

2  Domestic human trafficking and potentially 
vulnerable children

LHBT children

On the basis of this initial study, the group of lesbian, homosexual, bi-
sexual and transgender (LHBT) children is estimated to be moderately to 
reasonably vulnerable to human trafficking, with the proviso that ho-
mosexual and bisexual boys and transgenders are regarded as more vul-
nerable to human trafficking than lesbian and bisexual girls. The vul-
nerability of homosexual and bisexual boys and transgenders is mainly 
connected with individual and socio-economic factors. It did not appear from 
this study that human traffickers target LHBT children on a large scale. On the basis of this initial study, 
the group of LHBT children, with particular emphasis on homosexual and bisexual boys and transgen-
ders, are assigned to the category ‘research and prevention’.

Children with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa

On the basis of this initial study, children with the eating disorder ano-
rexia nervosa are regarded as slightly vulnerable to human trafficking. 
Their potential vulnerability could be connected with individual factors. 
The members of this group that might be most vulnerable to human 
trafficking are the girls who suffer from anorexia and go online in 
search of fellow sufferers. However, the indications in this initial study 
that human traffickers target this group are very weak. On that basis, 
this group of children is assigned to the category ‘vigilance’.

2.1 Introduction

Children are vulnerable to human trafficking.1 However, only a small proportion actually become vic-
tims. Which groups face a greater risk than others has been the subject of research for some time.2 Re-
cent research into domestic human trafficking has focused mainly on factors that make children vulner-
able to sexual exploitation, the relationship between a victim and the perpetrator and the personal 
characteristics of the victim and the perpetrator. Although the research into the factors that make chil-
dren vulnerable to sexual exploitation is still relatively new, more has been learned about them over the 
years. For example, it has been found that children who have been abused, bullied or neglected are at 
greater risk of becoming victims.3 The same applies for children who are mildly mentally handicapped.4 
The fact that one or more of these risk factors applies to a child does not imply that he or she will actu-
ally become a victim of human trafficking.5 That would be too simplistic an assertion. Nevertheless, 
knowledge about these factors is important so that more can be done in the way of prevention. For ex-
ample, institutions in the Netherlands that work with mildly mentally handicapped children know that 
they need to be particularly watchful for signs of human trafficking and have to know what to do if they 
have any suspicions. In short, with knowledge about sources of vulnerability, it is possible to design 
prevention programmes and offer protection.6

To further map the population of children at risk, this analysis starts with a review of the statistics. 
In 2014, 1,561 possible victims of human trafficking were reported to the Coordination Centre for Victims 
of Human Trafficking (CoMensha). Of this total, 283 were minors, a large proportion of whom were 
Dutch girls.7 The National Rapporteur has also analyzed the sectors in which minors were exploited in 
the period 2008 – 2012. According to the reports that CoMensha received, 58% were sexually exploited 
and a further 27% had not yet worked during that period.8 However, those figures were not broken down 
by nationality.

With respect to domestic human trafficking, the greatest concern in recent years has been for Dutch 
girls who are sexually exploited. Not surprisingly, therefore, there has been a great deal of research on 
this group. These studies have concentrated mainly on the loverboy method, an approach used by boys to 
manipulate Dutch girls, under the guise of a loving relationship, to earn money for them by performing 
sexual acts with clients for payment.9 The angle taken in the exploratory analysis of the two groups 
discussed in this chapter is different, focusing not on the method adopted by the human trafficker but

5 The European Commission says on this point: ‘The analysis of risk and resilience factors revealed that the extent to which a child 
is vulnerable to trafficking is only rarely determined by one particular factor. Rather, children are usually exposed to a combination of 
circumstances which result in them becoming victims of trafficking. It should be noted that the factors alone do not cause trafficking. 
Trafficking happens because of the demand for the services of the victims and the goods produced through their exploitation, generating 
huge profits’ (European Commission, 2015: p. 8).

These two groups were chosen because they have been mentioned in connection with sexual exploi-
tation in the last two years and because too little is known about them to be able to confirm or rebut 
this connection. As mentioned in chapter 1, this chapter attempts to answer two questions: (1) To what 
extent is there evidence that this group of children are vulnerable to human trafficking? and (2) To what 
extent is there evidence that human traffickers specifically target this group?11 This section contains an 
initial study. Since little research has been conducted into these two groups from the perspective of hu-
man trafficking, the information in it is based on exploratory studies, anecdotal material12 and warnings 
received by the National Rapporteur from the professional field.

The research also explicitly covers the vulnerability of these two groups to sexual violence.13 It is 
likely that when exploitation of members of these two groups occurs, it will often be preceded or ac-
companied by sexual violence.14 To properly identify and prevent exploitation, it is important to inves-
tigate this interconnectedness.

2.2 LHBT children

2.2.1 General risk factors and Dutch policy
‘The 20th century is also characterized by the emergence of the gay emancipation movement,’ the Min-
ister of Education, Culture and Science said in a letter to the Dutch parliament on 10 May 2013.15 The 
letter outlined the growing attention being devoted to the emancipation of lesbian women, homo-
sexual men, bisexuals and transgenders. The government’s first letter to parliament on ‘government 
policy and homosexuality’ dates from 1988. It set out the aim of creating a situation where everyone, 
whether homosexual or heterosexual, ‘can take part in every facet of social life on the basis of equality’.16 
Since then, there has been growing attention to the emancipation of the LHBT community in the Neth-
erlands, one of the aims being ‘to prevent discrimination and combat violence against this vulnerable 
group’.17

It is not known precisely how many young LHBTs there are in the Netherlands. It also depends on how 
one defines a person’s sexual orientation. ‘Sexual orientation is usually seen as a relatively stable charac-
teristic of a person that can be expressed through sexual behaviour or self-identification as gay, bisexual 
or heterosexual. It refers to the extent to which an individual is sexually and romantically oriented to-

10 For the sake readability, the report uses the terms children and youths. Both terms refer to minors, unless otherwise 
specified.

11 The vulnerability of a particular group and the extent to which its members are targeted by human traffickers with 
a view to exploiting them often coincide, but not necessarily. See also Chapter 1. 

12 The anecdotal material is often taken from the media.
13 Although this report focuses on human trafficking, the National Rapporteur’s mandate also extends to sexual vio-

lence against children. 
14 ‘Despite the strong evidence that victimized youth often experience multiple victimizations, researchers and prac-

titioners treating maltreated youth tend to focus on and treat one particular type of victimization (e.g., sexual abuse, 
witnessing domestic violence) and fail to take into account the reality that many victimized children experience 
more than one type of abuse’ (Reid et al. 2015: p. 3). See also Finkelhor et al. 2007.

wards men, women or both’.18 In a survey carried out for the report from roughly 9% of the respondents19 
described themselves as gay or lesbian or bisexual. In the survey, more men also described themselves as 
gay than bisexual and more women as bisexual than lesbian.20 The term ‘transgender’ is reserved for 
persons whose gender at birth, gender identity and gender expression do not correspond.21 There are no 
reliable estimates of the size of this group.22 The government reported that in 2013 there were a million 
lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders in the Netherlands.23

Although there is a high level of acceptance of homosexuality in the Netherlands,24 there are still 
concerns. For example, it is less accepted in orthodox religious communities25 and it has also been found 
that young people take a more negative view of homosexuality.26 LHBT emancipation is also certainly not 
regarded as complete and a range of measures have therefore been adopted over the years. One of them 
is that tackling homophobic violence is a priority for the police and public prosecution service (PPS).27 
Legislation is also constantly being amended in order to reverse any legal inequalities between LHBTs and 
heterosexuals.28

There is also an emphasis in policies on the emancipation of 
young LHBTs in non-Western migrant communities. For example, 
the government is exploring possibilities of creating a dialogue 
about homosexuality and strengthening the position of LHBTs with-
in these communities. It is also looking at the psychological prob-
lems faced by young LHBTs and has found it necessary to adopt spe-
cific measures to prevent suicide among members of this group.

In addition to the fact that young LHBTs seem to be more vul-
nerable to (sexual) violence, psychological problems, discrimina-
tion and stigmatization, in recent years they have also been men-
tioned on several occasions in terms of a particular vulnerability 
to human trafficking. This has emerged from exploratory studies, news reports and signals that have

reached the National Rapporteur.29 In the United States’ Trafficking in Persons report in 2014,30 LHBTs were 
even described as a group requiring specific attention. The Federal Strategic Action Plan on Services for Victims of 
Trafficking in the United States for the period 2013 – 2017 specifically mentioned the need to gather informa-
tion about LHBTs in order to provide them with better protection against human trafficking. This ex-
ploratory analysis looks in more detail at the information that is known about underage LHBTs in relation 
to human trafficking, including a review of their possible vulnerability and indications that could suggest 
that young LHBTs in the Netherlands are exploited by human traffickers.

This section focuses on three specific factors that increase vulnerability to human trafficking that have 
emerged from exploratory research and which could apply to young LBHTs:

I. Minority stress and possible vulnerability to human trafficking
II. Psychological problems and possible vulnerability to human trafficking
III. Sexual violence and possible vulnerability to human trafficking

These three possible relationships are discussed individually. Nevertheless, they usually coincide and 
have to be understood in conjunction with each other to understand the potential vulnerability to hu-
man trafficking.31

This exploratory study concludes by looking at what is known about the possible exploitation of 
young LHBTs in the Netherlands. Because exploratory research has highlighted the difficulty of identify-
ing members of this group who might be exploited, this section also reviews what is known about young 
LHBTs who have sex for payment and who work in prostitution, since it is to be expected that if young 
LHBTs are sexually exploited, they will belong to this group.

2.2.2 Minority stress and possible vulnerability to human trafficking
As mentioned above, young LHBTs can be vulnerable in a number of respects. One factor that makes 
them particularly vulnerable is minority stress,32 which Meyer defines as ‘additional stress that you might 
experience if you are a member of a minority. It consists of various components: experiencing upsetting 
events, anticipating them, internalized homosexual- or trans-negativity, hiding one’s identity and a lack 
of social support’.33 Meyer writes the following about the factors underlying minority stress:

29 See, for example, Los, 2014; Martinez and Kelle, 2013; Polaris, 2015; Secret Garden, 2012. See also the website of LGBTQ 
–nation, an organization in the US that keeps records of reports of LHBT persons who have been exploited (available 
at http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/human-trafficking/, consulted on 4 February 2016) and the statement in 2014 by 
the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons in the United States, which referred to this as an area requir-
ing special attention (available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/233940.pdf, consulted on  4 Febru-
ary 2016).

Vulnerability up Close

Minority stress and underlying factors
‘In developing the concept of minority stress, researchers’ underlying assumptions have been 
that minority stress is (a) unique—that is, minority stress is additive to general stressors that are 
experienced by all people, and therefore, stigmatized people are required an adaptation effort 
above that required of similar others who are not stigmatized; (b) chronic—that is, minority 
stress is related to relatively stable underlying social and cultural structures; and (c) socially 
based—that is, it stems from social processes, institutions, and structures beyond the individual 
rather than individual events or conditions that characterize general stressors or biological, ge-
netic, or other non-social characteristics of the person or the group.’34

One of the characteristics of minority stress is that it is linked to membership of a group with distinc-
tive characteristics and arises from social interaction. The European Commission says in its report that 
belonging to a group that is socially excluded and/or marginalized is a contributory factor to vulnera-
bility to human trafficking.35 Marginalization, as defined by the European Commission, relates to so-
cial groups that are discriminated against, have a lower socio-economic status and have fewer oppor-
tunities in society.36 The LHBT community in the Netherlands does not meet all of these criteria. The 
concerns about the LHBT group relate mainly to the areas of discrimination and social acceptance. The 
vulnerability of LHBTs will therefore probably also depend to a large extent on the degree of stigmatiza-
tion and marginalization experienced by the group. Although attitudes towards LHBTs are generally 
positive in the Netherlands, there are also some concerns.

Social acceptance of LHBTs in the Netherlands
In general it seems that youths and young adults have positive attitudes towards LHBTs. In 2012, 
72% of young adults said their attitude was positive37 and 6% said they had a negative attitude.38 
‘Among both pupils and young adults, girls and young people who are not religious are far more 
positive than boys and religious young people. Non-Western pupils are also more negative,39 as 
are secondary students with a lower level of schooling’.40 Four in ten of the young LHBs41 who 
were interviewed in the study by the Dutch Institute of Social Studies (SCP)42 said that they had 
had at least one negative experience43 in the previous year because they were LHB. ‘More serious

its report. 
36 European Commission, 2015.
37 In 2006, 61% of young people said this (SCP, 2015).
38 In 2006, 18% of young people felt this (SCP, 2015). As regards views towards about transgenders, 45% of young people 

are positive, 11% are negative and the rest are neutral or don’t know (SCP, 2015: p. 26).
39 For example, research by Amsterdam’s municipal health service shows that ‘more than a fifth of the young people 

in Amsterdam have negative views about LHBT schoolmates’. According to the same study, ‘more than four to five 
times as many Turkish and Moroccan as Dutch students have a negative attitude [towards homosexuality than native 
Dutch pupils]’ (Amsterdam GGD, 2012: p. 35). 

40 SCP, 2015.
41 In the same study by the SCP, lesbian girls and homosexual and bisexual boys were asked about their experiences. 

Transgenders were not included in the study. 
42 The young LHBTs were questioned in 2013 (SCP, 2015: p. 48, table 3.6).
43 ‘Homosexual and bisexual youths experienced this more often than girls (47% versus 34%). This could be related to 

the finding that attitudes towards homosexual and bisexual boys are more negative than towards girls’. Half of the 
LHBT youths who had told someone had had a negative experience (SCP, 2015: p. 48 – 49).

forms of negative reactions such as threats, sexual harassment or fighting occurred less often, 
but were still mentioned by roughly one in twenty LHB youths’.44 Young LHBs are also bullied on 
a weekly or even daily basis four times more often than heterosexual youths.45 They generally 
feel less comfortable at school and take days off more often than young heterosexuals.46 ‘Of the 
transgenders who have “come out” and go to school, a quarter experienced violence in the year 
preceding the study [2012]’.47

Although social acceptance of young LHBTs in the Netherlands has improved in recent years, there are 
still concerns, 48 which relate mainly to young LHBTs who grow up in orthodox religious communities 
and in migrant communities.49 Research also shows that there are concerns about the treatment of 
young LHBTs at schools50 and in the home.51

It is known that young LHBTs use the Internet to establish contacts more often than young hetero-
sexuals, often with the aim of meeting people with the same orientation outside their own social envi-
ronment.52 It has also been found that young homosexuals and male bisexuals have contact of a sexual 
nature or sex on the Internet or with a person they have met online relatively more frequently than 
lesbian and heterosexual youths.53 Gay and bisexual youths also transmit materials of a sexual nature via 
social media more often.54 Although the Internet can play an important role in establishing contact with 
peers55 and is a useful source of information, it can also make young LHBTs more vulnerable to sexual 
violence and human trafficking, particularly when they open themselves up to individuals whose mo-

51 In the SCP study, LHB youths say they receive far less support from parents than heterosexual youths say they do. ‘For 

example, they are less able to talk about their problems and receive less emotional support than they need’ (SCP,

53 Homosexual and bisexual youths [have] sexual contact on or via the Internet more often, for example by displaying 

something sexual in front of the webcam themselves, sending photos or films of a sexual nature, or having sex with 
a partner they have met on the Internet. This applies for 58% of homosexual and bisexual youths compared with 28% 
of heterosexual youths. This is a significant difference. This study looked at ‘differences in sexual problems and risks 
among youths aged between 17 and 24’ (De Graaf et al. 2012: p. 43 – 44). See also Bauermeister et al. 2014. The re-
search population in the latter study comprised young people aged between 18 and 25.

tives are unknown to them and when they share sexually explicit material with others.56 Research by 
Dank et al. has shown, for example, that young LHBTs between the ages of 18 and 24 experience vio-
lence, including sexual violence,57 significantly more often than their heterosexual contemporaries.58 
Although the question of whether young LHBTs who seek contact 
with other persons on the Internet face an increased risk from 
human traffickers has not been investigated, it is not inconceiv-
able. For example, it has repeatedly been found that human traf-
fickers also search for vulnerable young people online59 and use 
material of a sexual nature that they acquire in this way as a 
means of coercing young people into a situation in which they 
can exploit and maintain control over them.60

Young LHBTs from religious and ethnic communities appear 
to face a higher risk of marginalization and social exclusion than 
other LHBTs.61 For example, the parents of three in four young 
Moroccan and Turkish LHBTs regard it as a problem. The figure 
among Antillean and Surinamese parents is one in three, com-
pared with one in six among native Dutch parents.62 According to 
the Netherlands Centre for Social Development (Movisie), these 
young people face ‘a three-fold problem’. The first problem faced 
by ethnic LHBs63 is ‘an inner conflict between homosexual feel-
ings and loyalty to their family and religion. The inability of eth-
nic [LHBs] to give expression to their feelings can lead to a series 
of psychological and somatic problems (isolation, parasuicide, 
dropping out of school, unsafe behaviour, unwanted pregnancies, etc.)’.64 If they can accept their sexu-
al orientation, a potential problem is that their social environment will not accept their sexual prefer-
ence. It can therefore also be difficult for young ethnic LHB persons to discuss their sexual orientation 
with family and friends.65 It can be very difficult to tell others about it because doing so ‘can lead to an 
accumulation of practical problems in areas such as housing, problems with the family and difficulty in 

56 ‘In general, social networking sites play a role in the recruitment of children — in particular for sexual exploitation’ (European Com-
mission, 2015: p. 65). A protective factor against human trafficking could be safe offline and online meeting places 
where young LHBTs can meet others who have or have not already come out. For example, see www.jongenout.nl,

establishing contact with others in the same situation’.66 The latter 
problem arises from the fact that members of this group who need 
help might have difficulty gaining access to ‘white’ social services, 
such as social work and shelter, youth care agencies and local wel-
fare facilities. As Movisie puts it, ‘[the social services] currently still 
lack expertise with regard to the problems of this group’.67 A study 
by the SCP has shown that religious LHB youths68 are also particu-
larly vulnerable. ‘Religious young people are more often in a situa-
tion where no one around them is aware of their feelings towards 
members of their own sex and they themselves have a more negative attitude to their own sexual 
orientation’.69 An earlier study by the SCP also showed that religious individuals have a negative attitude 
towards homosexuality far more often than non-religious individuals.70 Young religious people are also 
less inclined to declare their sexual preference than their non-religious peers and their sexual orienta-
tion is also accepted less often by their parents.71

One potential effect of the lack of social acceptance and the negative treatment of religious and 
ethnic LHBT youths is that these young people will start using riskier ways of establishing contact with 
like-minded individuals and/or experimenting with their own sexuality.72 The three-fold problem that 
they face can also give these young people the feeling that they have few options because of a fear of 
social exclusion, which can result in their being  forced to break off contact with their social 
environment,73 thus creating a vulnerable position that can be abused by human traffickers. Although 
religious and ethnic young LHBTs could be more vulnerable to exploitation for these reasons, there is 
no evidence that large numbers of them actually become victims.74

66 Movisie, 2007. See also GGD Amsterdam, 2012; Regioplan, 2015. According to Regioplan’s report, specialized facili-
ties are almost only to be found in the large cities and scarcely ever in smaller towns (2015: p. 89).

67 Movisie, 2007. In Amsterdam, for example, there is an organization specifically for LHBTs with a distinct ethnic-
cultural background (http://www.stichtingsecretgarden.nl/?page_id=11, consulted on 25 February 2016). The or-
ganization Veilige Haven is also devoted specifically to LHBT youths from a multicultural and/or religious commu-
nity (http://www.veiligehavenamsterdam.nl/C251-Veilige-Haven.html, consulted on 25 February 2016). For other 
social services that are available, see also Regioplan’s study (2015: p. 33 ff.).

68 Naturally, there is some overlap between the groups of ethnic and religious LHBT youths. 
69 SCP, 2015: p. 57. 
70 Religious youths are described as particularly vulnerable in the SCP’s study because homosexuality is often a sensi-

tive subject in their social environment and it is certainly not automatically acceptance. This is apparent, for exam-
ple, from the fact that 34% of people who attend church once a week or more are negative about homosexuality, 
compared with 4% of individuals who never go to church (SCP, 2010).

71 The same study also argues that ‘[LHB] youths with a religious upbringing have attempted suicide more often’ (SCP, 
2010: p. 202).

72 European Commission, 2015. See also Reid, 2014. In her article, she discusses the risk of becoming a victim of human 
trafficking and bases her arguments on the General Strain Theory. She describes how frustration and disappointments 
can lead to risky behaviour and how that makes them vulnerable to human traffickers.

73 According to figures from Veilige Haven, 44 of the 102 clients they helped in 2011 required shelter. These cases often 
involved threats, domestic violence or homelessness (GGD Amsterdam, 2012). See also Secret Garden, 2013. 

74 Concerns arose in the Netherlands about Moroccan youths in 2001, when a study by van Horn et al. showed that they 
appeared to be over-represented in youth prostitution. The concerns receded in 2009 when research by Korf et al. in 
that year found no empirical evidence to support that claim. 

‘There is generally little acceptance of homosex-
uality in Moroccan, Turkish, Chinese, Suri-
namese and Protestant groups. It is often re-
garded as irreconcilable with marriage and 
family values, for example because sex must be 
intended for the purposes of procreation. This is 
seen as the natural order of things’[Rutgers 
WPF, 2013a].

Vulnerability up Close

International research also shows that young LHBTs are over-represented in the youth homeless 
population in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.75 The explanation given for this is 
that their sexual orientation is not accepted by their social environment and they are sometimes forced 
to leave home.

Homeless young LHBTs in other countries
International studies in the United States,76 Canada77 and the United Kingdom78 have shown that 
young LHBTs are homeless significantly more often than their heterosexual peers. In many cases, 
the parents do not accept their child’s sexual preference, which can lead to physical and mental 
abuse and to the youth’s (forced) departure from home.79 Because they usually lack a social net-
work and have limited access to help, they consequently often end up on the street. Once home-
less, young LHBTs find themselves in a particularly vulnerable position. They experience sexual 
violence seven times more often than young heterosexual homeless persons,80 they engage in 
unsafe sex more frequently81 and they suffer more severely from psychological complaints.82 
According to a study by the Urban Institute in New York83 in 2015, many young homeless LHBTs 
in New York end up in prostitution in order to survive.84 This too is often accompanied by physi-
cal and sexual abuse and threats.85 The fact that these young people do not have a safe place to 
go to, usually experience social exclusion and psychological problems and engage in risky situa-

76 According to various studies, between 20% and 40% of the homeless youth population in the United States describe 

themselves as LHBTs (e.g. Ventimiglia, 2012; Ray, 2006; Martinez and Kelle, 2013). 
77 A study of young homeless persons between the ages of 15 and 24 in Canada showed that 29.62% regarded them-

selves as ‘non-hetero’, with 5% of the respondents describing themselves as exclusively gay or lesbian and 24.62% 
saying they were bisexual or ‘bi-curious’ or that they did not yet know their sexual reference (Gaetz, 2004). 

78 Research in the United Kingdom shows that LHBT youths between the ages of 16 and 25 make up almost 24% of the 
homeless youth population (The Albert Kennedy Trust, 2015). 

79 For example, in a survey by Rew et al. of 425 homeless youths in the United States, 73% of the homeless gay and 
lesbian youths and 25.6% of the homeless bisexual youths said they ended up on the street after an argument with 
their parents over their sexual orientation (Rew et al. 2005). See also The Albert Kennedy Trust, 2015; Edidin et al. 
2012; Cull et al. 2006. 

80 Ray, 2006. 
81 Cochran et al. 2002. The study by Rew et al. also showed that sexually transmitted diseases are more common among 

LHB than heterosexual homeless youths, although the difference is not significant (Rew et al. 2005). 
82 Cochran et al. 2002.
83 For the study by the Urban Institute in New York, interviews were held with 283 young homeless persons between 

the ages of 15 and 26 in New York who engaged in ‘survival sex’. Of them, 37% were bisexual, 23% homosexual, 15% 
lesbian, 3% ‘queer’, 13% heterosexual and 9% ‘other’, for example pansexual. On average, the participants’ first 
sexual contact in exchange for money and/or another form of remuneration occurred at the age of seventeen (Urban 
Institute New York, 2015). 

84 In an earlier study of homeless LHBT and heterosexual youths in America between the ages of sixteen and nineteen 
(366 heterosexuals and 63 LHBTs) it was found that homeless homosexual youths engaged in ‘survival sex’ far more 
often than heterosexual youths (27.8% compared with 9%) (Whitbeck et al. 2004). 

85 In the study by the Urban Institute in New York, 91% of the participants also said they performed this work reluc-
tantly.

tions in order to earn money makes this group vulnerable to sexual exploitation and human 
trafficking.86

Reflecting the findings in other countries, Felten et al. do not rule out the possibility that young LHBTs 
are also over-represented in the homeless youth population in the Netherlands. They concluded that 
further research is needed to learn more about the situation in this country.87 It seems advisable that 
such research should also investigate whether and to what extent sexual violence, sex for payment and/
or sexual exploitation occurs among young homeless LHBTs in the Netherlands.

2.2.3 Psychological problems and possible vulnerability to human trafficking
International research into the emotional and psychological well-being of LHBT persons shows that 
members of this group suffer more from depression and anxiety than heterosexuals.88 The SCP study 
into young adult LHBs supports that finding and showed that ‘the prevalence of some psychological 
complaints (feeling down, not being calm and at ease, and being unhappy) is (almost) twice as high’.89 
Furthermore, ‘more than half of the LHB schoolchildren also have psychological or behavioural prob-
lems. They suffer from emotional problems, behavioural problems and hyperactivity more than twice 
as often, and problems with contemporaries three times as often’.90 Moreover, research has shown that 
‘the negative treatment of young people by peers because they are LHBTs is accompanied by diminished 
psychological health, more school-related problems and greater drug use’.91 Another notable finding is 
that the chance of suicide is greater among LHBTs.92 ‘One in seven lesbian or bisexual girls and one in 
eight gay or bisexual boys suffer from complaints connected with depression often or very often. Sixteen 
percent of these girls and nine percent of these boys have actually attempted suicide at least once. The 
figure is even higher among young transgenders’.93 The poorer psychological well-being of young LHBTs 

86 Martinez and Kelle argue that human traffickers target homeless minors more often because they are easy to ma-
nipulate and are defenceless. According to them, underage LHBTs in particular face a serious risk of becoming vic-
tims of sexual exploitation’(Martinez and Kelle, 2013). The study by the Urban Institute New York also showed that 
15% (43 participants) of the LHBT youths who engaged in survival sex had had an ‘exploiter’ at some point. The major-
ity of them had to surrender at least part of their income to this person. Some respondents also said they had been 
raped, assaulted and threatened by their ‘exploiter’. It is not known to what extent this applies to homeless hetero-
sexual youths. (Urban Institute New York, 2015). 

87 Felten et al. 2015. Amsterdam’s city council has also called for special attention for homeless LHBT youths who, be-
cause they are over the age of eighteen, disappear from sight as soon as the mandatory youth care ends (proposal 
from van Kaya, Duijndam and Toonk: ‘Give young homeless persons a chance in Amsterdam’. Municipality of Am-
sterdam, 2015). 

88 Cochran, 2001; Gilman et al. 2001; Herrell et al. 1999; Sandford et al. 2001; Bailey, 1999. Meyer ultimately reaches the 
same conclusion, but does explain in his meta-analysis that there are also some reservations to be expressed about 
many of the studies conducted into this subject. The reservations mainly concern a possible bias in the research 
population (Meyer, 2003). One of the reservations Meyer makes about studies into LHBT youths is that those who 
volunteer to take part in them are usually persons who have had their coming-out, so that the group that have not 
are probably not covered in the study.

Vulnerability up Close

can be explained in part by their less positive situation at home and at school,94 but possibly also by 
loneliness,95 diminished self- esteem96 and minority stress.97

These underlying factors and psychological problems can push young LHBTs into a position of vul-
nerability that can be abused by human traffickers. Young people who find themselves in such a vulner-
able position and seek contact with individuals in a similar position and acceptance and/or love outside 
their own environment could be particularly susceptible to being recruited by human traffickers.98

2.2.4 Sexual violence and possible vulnerability to human trafficking
A great deal of research has been conducted into LHBTs in relation to sexual violence. A drawback of 
that research for the purposes of this exploratory study is that it covers the situation of young LHBTs 
between the ages of 12 and 25 and does not focus specifically on minors.99 What stands out in a review 
of these studies is that, on average, homosexual men and bi-
sexual men and women in particular suffer more sexual vio-
lence100 during their lives than heterosexuals.101 ‘Where sexual 
violence has occurred, the average age at which a homosexual 
boy was a victim for the first time was fourteen, compared with 
nineteen for heterosexual boys’.102 Gay and bisexual boys had 
also experienced pressure or coercion to engage in sex more often than heterosexual boys and lesbian 
girls of the same age.103 The differences between LHBs and young heterosexuals in terms of experienc-
ing sexual violence could possibly be explained ‘by the stress that their minority status brings with it 
(minority stress)’.104

Transgenders have ‘far more experience of sexual violence than non-transgenders […]’.105 Transgen-
ders who were born as male had suffered violence four to eight times more often than non-transgen-
ders. They had also relatively frequently experienced sexual violence before reaching the age of six-

96 Steiger et al. 2014.
97 Meyer, 2003; SCP, 2015.
98 The Internet is one way in which young people can come in contact with like-minded persons outside the safe en-

vironment. The European Commission refers in this context to the risk that human traffickers seem to have become 
increasingly active on the Internet, and particularly in chatrooms, in establishing contact with vulnerable young 
people (European Commission, 2015). 

99 Whenever a study is referred to, information is also given about the ages of the respondents.
100 For the study by Rutgers WPF, ‘”sexual violence” is broadly defined and ranges from offensive sexual remarks and 

unwanted touching to being forced to perform or submit to sexual acts. People who said in the follow-up to the 
questionnaire that they had only experienced sexually offensive remarks were not included in the further analysis 
[of the research]’ (Rutgers WPF, 2013a: p. 25). The respondents in in this study were aged between 15 and 70.

101 According to research by Vermey et al., homosexual boys and bisexual girls reported sexual transgressions signifi-
cantly more often than other groups. This was a secondary analysis of data from the representative population study 
‘Sex under the age of 25’, in which almost 8,000 young people were questioned via an online questionnaire (Vermey 
et al. 2014). 

102 This is a significant difference (Rutgers WPF, 2013a: p. 27).

sexual violence at least three times more often 
before reaching the age of sixteen’ [Rutgers

teen.106 A possible explanation for this is that it can be difficult for transgenders to indicate their sexual 
desires and boundaries,107 while at the same time they can also feel a deep need for validation of their 
gender identity because of uncertainty about their body.108 Another possible cause could be gender 
dysphoria,109 which can be described as ‘feelings of dissatisfaction with the gender in which a person is 
addressed by others and/or the gendered body’.110 It is often difficult for individuals who are struggling 
with gender dysphoria to get in touch with their own feelings, making it more difficult for them to de-
fine their own boundaries and then maintain them.111

Research in the field of human trafficking has shown that there is a possible link between a history 
of sexual violence and the chance of becoming a victim of human trafficking,112 and the European Com-
mission has described this as one of the risk factors for human trafficking.113 As the research discussed 
here has shown, young gays and male bisexuals and transgenders experience sexual violence more of-
ten, which could also suggest that they are more vulnerable to human trafficking than lesbian girls114 
and heterosexual boys.115

2.2.5 LHBTs, sexual exploitation and ‘youth prostitution’116

No research was found specifically about the relationship between LHBTs and sexual exploitation. Re-
search into this subject is complicated by the fact that no records are kept of the sexual orientation of 
possible victims of human trafficking who are known to the authorities. In order to learn more about 
whether and, if so, to what extent human traffickers might target LHBT youths with a view to exploiting 
them sexually, it was decided to analyse the information that is known about young LHBTs who provide 

106 ‘The people with transgender feelings who were born as women have also experienced sexual violence more often 
than non-transgender women. The observed differences cannot be attributed to an age effect’ (Rutgers WPF, 2013a: 
p. 28).

107 Rutgers WPF, 2013a: p. 29. See also Doorduin and Van Berlo, 2012; Iantaffi and Bockting, 2011; Kosenko, 2010; Seve-

112 European Commission, 2015; Van Dijke et al. 2012; Verwijs et al. 2011; Reid et al. 2015.
113 The European Commission says of this: ‘The analysis of individual factors demonstrates that the two main characteristics which 

are most widely recognised as determinants of vulnerability are a history of physical, psychological and/or sexual abuse, and a low level 
of awareness of risks.’ (European Commission, 2015: p. 28).

114 ‘Among lesbian women, the chance [of experiencing sexual violence] does not differ significantly from that of het-
erosexual women (Rutgers WPF, 2013a: p. 4).

115 See also Korf et al., who discuss the possible relationship between unwanted sexual experiences and entering pros-
titution at an early age. The researchers conclude that ‘sexual abuse […] is not a generally applicable causal explana-
tion for youth prostitution. However, that does not mean that victim trajectories cannot be an explanation at all, but 
factors other than sexual abuse apparently play at least play in boys starting to engage in paid sex’ (Korf et al. 2009: 
p. 101).

116 In the Netherlands, it is a criminal offence under Article 248b DCC to pay for sex with a child aged sixteen or seven-
teen. ‘Youth prostitution’ is an unfortunate term, since it seems to imply that it could be a legal activity. However, 
the prostitution is always an offence against public morals. The terms youth prostitution and young male prostitutes 
are nevertheless used in this section for the sake of consistency with earlier research (National Rapporteur, 2015: pp. 
8 and 23).

sexual services for payment in this section.117 The assumption behind this is that young LHBTs who are 
sexually exploited will fall into this group.

There is no known research in which underage LHBTs have 
been specifically asked to what extent they have provided sexual 
services for money or some other form of compensation. In one 
study, in which young people between the ages of 17 and 25 were 
asked whether they had ever done so, it emerged that homosex-
ual and bisexual boys had received money or some other form of 
remuneration for sex more often than heterosexual boys.118 The 
differences between lesbian and bisexual girls and heterosexual girls were less great.119 Future research 
into the subject could also explore the extent to which children in younger age groups provide sexual 
services in exchange for money or other form of compensation and at what age they did so for the first 
time.120

Another source of information about a possible relationship between young LHBTs and sexual ex-
ploitation is perhaps to be found in studies that have been conducted into ‘youth prostitution’ and what 
those studies have revealed about young LHBTs. What immediately stands out is that, other than the 
information mentioned above, scarcely anything is known about lesbian and bisexual girls who provide 
sexual services for payment.

There is more information with regard to homosexual and bisexual boys,121 about whom the follow-
ing situation can be described on the basis of exploratory studies of young male prostitutes. First and 
foremost, a report by Movisie shows that prostitution involving young males occurs in paedophile and 
homosexual circles.122 It is important to stress, however, that a young person who works as a prostitute 
is not necessarily gay or bisexual. Nevertheless, a large majority of the respondents in research by Korf 
et al. and Repetur and Veenstra into young male prostitutes described themselves as gay or bisexual.123 
Weijnen124 divides boys working in prostitution into different categories. He is the only person who also 
consistently links the sexual orientation of the boys to the classification he uses. Although there are 
reservations to be expressed about his classification and more research is needed,125 that classification 

117 An individual who pays for sex with a minor is guilty of a criminal offence under Article 248b DCC.
118 Fourteen percent of gay and bisexual males between the ages of 17 and 24 who were interviewed for the study by De 

Graaf et al. had been paid for sex, compared with 4% of young male heterosexuals. This is a significant difference. 
The extent to which underage boys have been paid for sex is not known (De Graaf et al. 2012: p. 43).

121 ‘Male prostitution’ is a term that covers both minors and adults working in the sector. Wherever the text is referring 

solely to minors, that is explicitly stated.
122 Movisie, 2009.
123 Korf et al. interviewed 44 boys who started engaging in prostitution when they were still minors. They found that a 

‘small majority regard themselves as homosexual (26; 59%), a third as bisexual (13; 30%) and a few see themselves as  
heterosexual (5; 11%)’ (Korf et al. 2009: p. 67). Repetur and Veenstra interviewed 11 boys who began working as 
prostitutes when they were still minors. One boy said he was heterosexual, two said they were bisexual and six said 
they were homosexual. Two boys did not comment on their sexual orientation (Repetur and Veenstra, 2010: p. 110). 

124 Weijnen, 2006. 
125 Van der Poel, 1991 and Korf et al. 2009 use a different classification, for example. The latter state that the research 

they had studied in order to produce their classification might have been outdated (p. 103).

‘There is evidence that the desire to maintain a 
good relationship with the other person is 
sometimes more important for victims of sexu-
ally transgressive behaviour than respecting 
their own boundaries. […]’ [Rutgers WPF et al. 
2014].

is followed here with the aim of gaining a clearer picture of the number of young gay and bisexual boys 
working in prostitution.126

Weijnen identifies two main categories: ‘amateurs’ and ‘professionals’. He divides the amateurs into 
three groups: gemarginaliseerde, gelukzoekers and bijverdieners. The first category consists of marginal-
ized individuals who seldom have a permanent place of residence or a regular income. They generally live 
on the street and engage in theft and prostitution, sometimes to fi-
nance an addiction. According to Weijnen, most of the members of 
this group are heterosexuals.127 The gelukzoekers, or fortune seekers, 
are in a similar situation, a distinction being that many are from East-
ern Europe and dream of a ‘better future’. Many of these young peo-
ple do not have homosexual or bisexual inclinations.128 The bijverdi-
eners are young people who sell sexual services to earn extra money. 
They usually have a permanent place to stay and experiment with 
their sexuality; they are often gay or bisexual. The professionals, 
Wijnen argues, earn ‘most of their income from prostitution’.129 Ac-
cording to him, these young people, almost without exception, have 
homosexual or bisexual feelings. As this classification shows, by no 
means all the young people who work in male prostitution have gay or bisexual feelings.130 There is also 
little that can be stated with certainty about possible exploitation of young male prostitutes on the basis 
of this classification. However, recent research into male prostitution by Los has shown that Dutch gay or 
bisexual boys who grow up in an environment that refuses to accept their sexual nature can be particu-
larly vulnerable to coercion and exploitation.131

As regards the nature and scale of male prostitution involving boys in general (in other words, includ-
ing heterosexual sex workers), the research is fairly unanimous that it is impossible to produce reliable 
statistics.132 Scarcely anything is known about the ages of the boys who work as prostitutes, although 
most seem to have reached the age of majority. Interviews with professionals, for example, have shown 
that ‘by far the largest group of young male prostitutes are over the age of eighteen; most are actually 

126 Where necessary, if possible reservations that can be expressed about the classifications on the basis of available 
research are mentioned.

127 Reservations can be expressed about the statement that this category consists mainly of heterosexuals, since the 
statement seems to be based on the response of a single respondent. Another reservation is that research in the US 
has shown that homeless homosexual boys engage in ‘survival sex’ more than three times more often than homeless 
heterosexual boys (Whitbeck et al. 2004). 

128 ‘By extension it is not unlikely that a small proportion of these boys do experiment with their sexual feelings, al-
though they are unlikely to openly express themselves as bisexual or homosexual’ (Weijnen, 2006: p. 36). See also 
the news report ‘Seksnetwerk opgerold: Zuid-Limburgers opgepakt voor het exploiteren en chanteren van tientallen 
jongens uit Roemenië’ [Sex network dismantled: group from South Limburg arrested for exploiting and blackmail-
ing dozens of boys from Romania], 26 May 2012, available at http://www.riec.nl/doc/limburg/LD%20Roemenen.pdf,

129 Weijnen, 2006: p. 38.
130 This is also supported by the research carried out by Korf et al. 2009 and Repetur and Veenstra, 2010.
131 For his study, Los examined eight large police files and six smaller files, as well as five reports of male prostitution 

involving young people. The other two vulnerable groups that are mentioned are young adults with an East Euro-
pean and Spanish-speaking background and African asylum seekers. There is still some uncertainty about the latter 
group because it was usually impossible to verify their statements (Los, 2014).

older than 22. Respondents felt the average age of young male prostitutes was more likely to be rising 
than falling’.133

The exploratory studies are also practically unanimous as regards the extent to which boys are sexu-
ally exploited in male prostitution, i.e., that there is too little evidence to presume that it occurs on a large 
scale.134 Although some studies mention examples of the exploitation of boys,135 the vast majority of boys 
appear to have chosen to engage in this work themselves.136 However, Repetur and Veenstra question this 
finding in their study,137 arguing that the boys who have not chosen the work themselves could be sup-
pressing negative feelings as a form of coping behaviour.138 Those negative feelings could relate to aspects 
such as experiencing coercion and sexually transgressive behaviour, but possibly also situations in which 
they are exploited. Also mentioned in that context is the possible influence of codes of masculinity, which 
can lead to young people not seeing themselves as victims.

Codes of masculinity
Movisie gives the following example: “I have never talked to a young person who has said they had 
been sexual exploited or abused”.139 ‘This is a statement that many professionals will endorse,’ 
says Movisie. ‘Young people who work as prostitutes and young people who have been abused 
often use this myth themselves to hide their mixed feelings and vulnerability. It is an example of 
the masculine code that a man is in control of his life, which exists in many cultures and is intended to 
help boys and men get through difficult situations’.140

133 Los, 2014. The research by Korf et al. shows ‘that the assertion that half or more of male prostitutes are minors can-
not be sustained. It is even likely that the majority are 21 or older’ (Korf et al. 2009: p. 63). 

134 Los, 2014: p. 41; Van der Borne and Klooster, 2005; Korf et al. 2009; Salou et al. 2009.
135 According to the research by Salou et al., there are boys who ‘are used as an object of profit by means of human 

trafficking’ and who ‘enter the circuit via the path of manipulation, coercion and violence’ (Salou et al. 2009: p.6). 
Van der Borne and Klooster also refer to a number of cases in which there was clearly sexual exploitation of underage 
male prostitutes by third parties (Van der Borne and Klooster, 2005). In a study by Korf et al., for which 44 youths 
who were or had been engaged in prostitution as minors were interviewed, many of the respondents said they had 
sex with an adult in exchange for board and lodging or because they had debts. There were also a number of boys 
who were introduced to clients by their adult ‘sugar daddy’ or had to pay off a debt to a pimp by having sex with other 
men (Korf et al. 2009). 

136 Van der Borne and Klooster, 2005; Korf et al. 2009; Salou et al. 2009.
137 A further reservation to be expressed here is that this does not affect the criminal liability of the person who pays for 

sex with a minor pursuant to Article 248b DCC. See also National Rapporteur, 2015: p. 8, where it says: ‘Paying for sex 
with minors is never legal, and always constitutes an offence against public morals. It has therefore nothing to do 
with legal, regulated prostitution by adults. For “client”, one could equally read “sex offender”, for “youth prostitu-
tion” one should think in terms of a sex offence’.

This code of masculinity and the coping mechanisms developed by young people who have sex for pay-
ment can make it difficult to identify abuses and, possibly, exploitation. A review of the case law shows 
that there have nevertheless been convictions for the exploitation of underage Dutch boys in 
prostitution;141 however, it is not known whether or not the child victims were homosexual or bisexu-
al.142

Sexual exploitation of underage boys143

On 28 November 2013, the Noord-Holland District Court convicted an 18-year-old boy of conspir-
ing with others in the commission of human trafficking. In this case, a minor was persuaded that 
he had a debt and then forced by violence and threats to work as a prostitute in order to repay 
the non-existent debt. Potential clients were approached on chat sites and sex games were 
played online. Appointments were later made to continue the sex game in ‘real time’. The sexu-
al acts were filmed with a hidden camera, whereupon the clients were blackmailed or robbed. 
They were forced to pay large sums of money to prevent the images being shown to others. The 
threats were accompanied by severe violence, including the use of guns and knives. When the 
underage boy went into hiding, the suspect immediately found a new victim and tried to put him 
to work in the same way, but without success.

Cases like this show that there is in any case a demand for sex with underage boys.
The studies referred to above provide evidence that gay and bisexual boys work as male prostitutes 

and that they are potentially vulnerable to coercion and exploitation. However, nothing can be said with 
any certainty about the number of homosexual and bisexual youths engaged in youth prostitution or 
the possible exploitation of members of this group. Even when it comes to the nature and size of the 
entire group of underage male prostitutes, including heterosexual boys,144 or the scale on which coer-
cion and exploitation occur, there are no hard figures. The studies suggest that there is no reason to 
assume that exploitation occurs on a large scale,145 but what makes it so difficult to draw any firm con-
clusions is the so-called ‘triple taboo’:146 the taboo on homosexuality and bisexuality, the taboo on 
prostitution and the taboo on victimization of young men.147 According to the researchers, this makes

144 Research has also shown that it is not only homosexual and bisexual youths who engage in prostitution. This group 
also includes young heterosexuals (Van Gelder, 1998; Los, 2014).

145 Los, 2014: p. 41; Van der Borne and Klooster, 2005; Korf et al. 2009; Salou et al. 2009.
146 There may be a fourth taboo in the case of young male prostitutes because, more than with visits to heterosexual 

prostitutes, the taboos apply not only to the nature of the work, but also to the preference of the visiting client 
(Written information from an employee of De Koppeling, 23 November 2015). 

147 What can also make it difficult is that young male prostitutes have disappeared almost entirely from traditional loca-
tions and moved to the Internet (Los, 2014).

it difficult to ascertain the true scale of male child prostitution and complicates attempts at in-depth 
research into exploitation.148

2.2.6 Research and prevention
This initial exploratory study has identified a number of risk fac-
tors that make the LHBT group vulnerable to human trafficking. 
They relate to their isolation, the existence of taboos, minority 
stress, the search for like-minded individuals and (sexual) contact 
on the Internet and the increased chance of suffering sexual vio-
lence at a young age.149 These are worrying issues.150 Homosexual 
and bisexual boys and transgender youths are generally more 
susceptible to factors that make them vulnerable to human traf-
ficking. On the other hand, various exploratory studies have pro-
duced no evidence that young LHBTs are victims of exploitation 
on a large scale.151 This could be connected with factors that pro-
tect this group against human trafficking152 or the fact that hu-
man traffickers do not specifically target this group. However, 
further in-depth research is required before any firm conclusions 
can be reached. On the basis of this first exploratory analysis, it has been decided to assign the group of 
young LHBTs to the category ‘research and prevention’.153

In a letter to parliament in January 2016, the Minister of Security and Justice and the State Secretary 
for Health, Welfare and Sport announced that a qualitative study will be carried out into young male 
victims of human trafficking.154 This study will cover, among other things, the ‘forms of exploitation, 
recruitment (for example, the role of blackmail), the role of social media, perceptions, identification, 
risk assessment, care and possible relapse’.155 It is not known whether the study will also address the 
sexual orientation of possible victims. The research might also make it possible to gain a better insight 
into whether gay and bisexual boys face a greater risk of sexual exploitation. Studies into young male 
LHBTs have highlighted a number of risk factors that would justify looking specifically at the vulnerabil-
ity of gay and bisexual boys.

In his study, Los recommended that the police should be more proactive in conducting investiga-
tions online and should approach boys themselves with a view to preventing situations of coercion 
and exploitation.156 This method of investigation could provide a clearer picture of whether gay and 
bisexual boys who have sex for payment are being exploited. In response to that recommendation,

‘It is unclear to the Azough Commission to 
what extent boys are victims of human traffick-
ing/the loverboy problem. There have been a 
number of surveys of child male prostitution, 
but too little is known about the nature of the 
phenomenon and the numbers involved. It is 
therefore unclear whether it is mainly inciden-
tal and whether policy measures are required. 
Regardless of the scale, every form of male 
prostitution involving children must be tackled 
and prevented. The commission therefore rec-
ommends carrying out a quick scan on this sub-
ject’ [Azough Commission, 2014].

in 2015 the police organized a national week of action targeted at possible child victims of human 
trafficking and sexual violence157 in male prostitution.158

Another way of learning more about whether homosexual, bisexual and transgender youths offer 
sexual services for payment and/or are exploited is by interviewing 
social workers who specialize in providing care for these young peo-
ple. The reservation to be made here is that these young people ap-
pear to be reluctant to approach the social services when abuses 
occur, either because they do not regard themselves as victims or 
are unwilling to discuss the work they do.159 According to Repetur 
and Veenstra, boys are also often not recognized or treated as vic-
tims.160 To improve matters, it is worth considering setting up an 
accessible system of care for this group,161 with the necessary exper-
tise, which could also provide dedicated services for young ethnic 
and religious LHBTs.162

egy and procedure for engaging in a conversation with boys who engage in transactional sex. By displaying engage-
ment, the social worker can try to steer the conversation towards motives for and against, and the positive and 
negative consequences of, engaging in transactional sex. In this way, the young person can be helped, within certain 
limits, to make the right decision and possibly stop engaging in transactional sex’ (Movisie, 2013: p. 1).

162 Movisie, 2007. 

‘The specialized help appears to reach almost 
exclusively older children engaged in male 
prostitution. East European youths are over-
represented in this group. Younger male prosti-
tutes, both Dutch and from other countries, do 
have contact with other social services, but they 
are usually not aware that the youths engage in 
paid sex’ [Korf et al. 2009].

2.3 Children with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa

The decision to review the group of children with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa163 was based on a 
single court case in the Netherlands and two news reports in other countries. All three sources showed that 
girls with anorexia had been specifically approached for the purpose of abusing them and/or securing sexu-
ally explicit material from them. In the court case in the Netherlands, the perpetrator was also convicted of 
trafficking a girl he had met when she was still a minor and with respect to whom, once she had reached 
adulthood, he performed acts with the intention of sexually exploiting her. What stands out is that in both 
the court case and one of the newspaper reports there were references to ‘pro-ana coaches’ and ‘pro-ana 
makers’. This exploratory analysis sets out to discover whether girls with anorexia nervosa face an increased 
risk of becoming victims of sexual violence and/or human trafficking and whether there are reasons to as-
sume that they are actually being exploited.

2.3.1 Anorexia nervosa in the Netherlands
Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder that involves a preoccupation with eating, personal appearance 
and weight, resulting, among other things, in harmful eating behaviour.164 Although anorexia actually 
means ‘loss of appetite’, in reality victims suffering from the dis-
order suppress their appetite and/or hunger. The German word 
magerzucht comes closer to covering the nature of the disorder: 
‘an obsession with being thin’.165 Anorexia patients typically do 
not seek help, display no significant complaints and do not re-
gard themselves as being ill. Anorexia almost never occurs before 
puberty,166 and is most common among girls between the ages of 
fourteen and twenty.

It is difficult to determine how prevalent this eating disorder 
is in the Netherlands, partly because of problems in diagnosing 
it, and partly because of the denial and shame felt by patients 
because of the ‘fetish for thinness’ in Western culture.167 It is es-
timated that 0.4% of young women suffer from anorexia.168

163 It was decided not to discuss the eating disorder bulimia in this section because the National Rapporteur has not 
received any warnings in relation to it and the average age of girls and boys with bulimia is between 18 and 25 (Hoog-
duin and Hoogduin, 2008). 

164 These psychiatric disorders are also included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5), 
which is the standard work of the American Psychiatric Association.

165 Hoogduin and Hoogduin, 2008: p. 332.
166 Ibid: p. 337.
167 Ibid: p. 342.
168 ‘The 12 month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is approximately 0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among 

males, but anorexia is far less common in males than in females […]’ (DSM-5, 2013: p. 344).

‘Eating disorders are more than a fad or an out-
of-control diet. Nevertheless, our culture of di-
eting/slimming does seem to breed an excessive 
preoccupation with an “ideal weight”, particu-
larly among women. When this exaggerated 
concern is coupled with a negative self-image, 
fear of failure and perfectionism or takes hold 
in a social context of tensions in relationships 
and a lack of individuation during adolescence, 
there is a serious risk of a pathological disorder’ 
[Hoogduin and Hoogduin, 2008].

2.3.2 Eating disorders, sexual violence and human trafficking
At first glance, there does not seem to be any logical connection between eating disorders, sexual vio-
lence169 and human trafficking. However, as mentioned above, the existence of a connection is apparent 
from a Dutch court case in 2013 and two newspaper articles about how this specific group of girls has 
been targeted online with the aim of securing sexually explicit material and/or sexually abusing them.

In 2013, the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal convicted a 45-year-old man and sentenced him 
to two years in prison and mandatory placement under a hospital order for offences including rape, 
uttering threats and human trafficking of six girls/young women170 with an eating disorder and/or ano-
rexia-related  problems in the period 2006-2012.171 He was also 
charged with producing pornographic material of one of the under-
age victims. It emerged from the statements that the perpetrator 
had consciously established contact with insecure girls with an eat-
ing disorder on the Internet,172 for example on so-called ‘pro-ana 
websites’, which are usually created by people who suffer from an 
eating disorder and extol the virtues of being thin. The websites 
publish tips and tricks for losing weight quickly and suggestions on 
how to hide this behaviour from family and friends. Once the man 
had established contact on these websites, the conversations 
moved to social media, such as Skype, Kik and Whatsapp, where the 
man posed as a confidant of the victims, complimented them and told them he could help them to 
achieve their goal of losing weight.173 According to a number of the victims, the man called himself the 
‘ana-maker’, which, according to one of the victims, meant that ‘he transformed girls who were suscep-
tible to it into anorexia patients’.174 He also tried to force one of the girls, who had since reached the age 
of majority, to work as a prostitute in his sex club in Rotterdam by telling her that she had to repay a debt 
she owed to him.175 For some of the girls, because of their dependence on and loyalty to their ‘trainer’, 
their vulnerable background and the manipulative methods he used, the situation persisted for years.

169 ‘Consistent with previous findings, the present results indicate that the prevalence of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is high among individuals 
seeking inpatient treatment for Anorexia Nervosa (AN). A history of CSA was associated with greater psychiatric disturbance overall and a 
higher rate of dropout for patients of the binge-purge subtype’ (Carter et al. 2006).

170 It is not known precisely how many victims were minors. The suspect was in any case convicted of intentionally re-
moving a minor from the person with the legal capacity to exercise authority over her (Gelderland District Court 27 
June 2013, ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2013:2467). 

171 The suspect was convicted of human trafficking with respect to one victim (Gelderland District Court 27 June 2013, 
ECLI:NL: RBGEL:2013:2467; ECLI:NL:GHARL:2013:9961). 

172 A number of victims said that the suspect had contacted them via websites and/or social media visited by many girls 
with eating disorders. In a number of cases, the contact continued via Hyves (Gelderland District Court 27 June 2013, 
ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2013:2467; Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal 24 December 2013, ECLI:NL:GHARL:2013:9961).

Vulnerability up Close

On 6 April 2011, the British newspaper The Guardian176 published an article describing how recruiting 
agencies for producers of pornography were specifically targeting girls with anorexia to come and work 
for them as ‘models’. The article described how the girls were promised a lot of money if they accepted 
the offer. The girls were also approached on pro-ana websites. In 
order to win their confidence, on these websites and on forums 
the agencies posed as girls who were also struggling with ano-
rexia. Once they had gained the girls’ trust, the agencies looked 
for ways of securing revealing photographs of them.177 A number 
of these photos, and other photos that underage girls had them-
selves posted on pro-ana websites, were acquired by pornograph-
ic websites. Girls who were interviewed for the article did not 
know that their photos were being used for these purposes. They 
had assumed they were visting a website with other girls with 
anorexia and that they were speaking to girls who were going through the same things they were.

On 3 June 2015, an article by an investigative journalist about men who posed online as ‘pro-ana 
coaches’ with the aim of securing sexual material of girls suffering from anorexia appeared in Germa-
ny.178 Posing as a 15-year-old girl, the journalist contacted one of these ‘coaches’. The coach was an adult 
male, whose profile described him as a ‘professional pro-ana coach’ and said that girls could only reg-
ister with him if they were willing to do anything to lose weight and become thin. Among other things, 

the man asked for a photo of the journalist in her underwear in or-
der to determine how much weight she needed to lose and told her 
she would have to meet a number of conditions before he would 
agree to coach her. One of the conditions was that she had to pre-
pare to be ‘sexually humiliated’, because only then could she really 
lose weight and become genuinely anorexic. The man finally in-
structed her to make a film of herself masturbating on the toilet. He 
also ‘summoned’ her to his home in Frankfurt. The journalist then 

informed the German police, who in turn contacted Interpol, which investigated the case. The journal-
ist later returned to the pro-ana websites and found more advertisements for so-called ‘pro-ana coach-
es’.179

philen-getroffen-der-mich-in-die-magersucht-treiben-wollte-897, consulted on 26 October 2015. 

179 Members of the National Rapporteur’s staff have also visited websites and forums where girls with anorexia contact 
each other (various websites consulted on 18 February 2016). The impression they had was that underage Dutch girls 
also visit these sites in search of a coach or buddy who can help them to lose weight. Many of the messages sent also 
contained the sender’s mobile telephone number, Kik account and/or e-mail address. There were also a number of 
active users who offered their services and said they would ‘help’ the girls achieve their goals. The question is to what 
extent adults also visit these forums posing as young girls in an attempt to secure photos and films, for example. 

‘Anorexic porn is growing in popularity and the 
prevalence of pro-anorexia websites is making 
those with eating disorders easy targets for 
grooming. Vulnerable users of pro-anorexia 
websites are increasingly being courted for their 
emaciated frames by pornography agencies 
specialising in images of extremely thin wom-
en’ [Hobbs, The Guardian, 6 april 2011].

‘All the ads looking for ana-twins or WhatsApp 
groups seemed to have been placed by girls. But 
all of the pro-ana coaches either claimed to be 
male and over 20 or didn't offer any informa-
tion about their identity at all’ [Brenneisen,

At first glance the method used in these cases is similar to the 
loverboy approach that is adopted with vulnerable girls who are 
looking for love and/or social acceptance.180 But in the case of girls 
with an eating disorder, the perpetrator is not a human trafficker 
trying to recruit them by forming a relationship (the loverboy meth-
od), but a ‘coach’ offering to help the girl to achieve her goal.181 
These ‘coaches’ can sometimes induce the girl to send naked or 
semi-naked photos of herself so that he can ‘measure’ her and de-
cide what is needed to help her achieve the goal of ‘perfection’. The 
next step seems to be that the girl has to prove her loyalty. The coach 
puts pressure on her by suggesting that he is doing her a favour and 
that he will abandon her if she does not cooperate. This carrot-and-
stick approach, in combination with the vulnerable position in 
which these girls may find themselves, increases the chance that the 
girl will go to great lengths to prove her loyalty.182 This can result in 
her doing whatever the ‘coach’ expects of her, including sending 
nude photos or films of a sexual nature or visiting his home to work on her ‘slimming’. A position of 
dependence in relation to such a ‘coach’ makes these girls vulnerable to sexual violence and to sexual 
exploitation.

Because the information presented here is confined to a single court case and two news articles from 
other countries, the question is whether and, if so, to what extent girls with anorexia in the Netherlands 
become victims of a ‘pro-ana coach’. The situations described above reveal a number of risk factors for 
human trafficking. Girls who suffer from anorexia are generally between the ages of fourteen and twen-

ty, often do not see themselves as being ill and frequently suffer 
from low self-esteem. They often do not speak to their parents 
and/or friends about their extreme desire to lose weight because 
they feel the subject is taboo. These girls therefore move outside 
their safe environment in the search for information and contact 
with others who share their feelings. The main factors that hu-
man traffickers can abuse are their isolation, psychological prob-
lems and desire for acceptance.183 What can further increase 
these girls’ vulnerability is that some of them go online to find 

others who ‘understand’ them and are also striving for ‘perfection’. This has led to the creation of the 
so-called pro-ana websites, and girls who visit them can make themselves vulnerable if they share infor-
mation and photos that could then be used for the purposes of exploitation.184 Revealing photographs 
and films, in particular, can be used by human traffickers for blackmail. Girls who visit chatrooms and 
take risks in establishing contact with strangers are also more vulnerable to human trafficking.185 All of 

180 See also National Rapporteur, 2009; National Rapporteur, 2013; Verwijs et al. 2011; Brayley et al. 2011.
181 The case described by Hobbs (6 April 2011) differs from the other two cases. The article published in The Guardian was 

mainly concerned with pornography agencies that specifically targeted girls with anorexia. However, these agencies 
also used deception.

182 Srikantiah, 2007.
183 This is also identified as one of the risk factors by the European Commission (European Commission, 2015).
184 Ibid. 
185 European Commission, 2015.

‘The ‘loverboys’ are men who consciously 
make women (or men) emotionally dependent 
by starting a love affair with their victims and 
subsequently exercise force to involve them in 
prostitution and sometimes other criminal ac-
tivities like fraud with phone subscriptions, 
ATM cards and credit cards, or drug trafficking. 
The internet is used to recruit victims. Victims 
are identified through the internet and/or 
asked to send compromising pictures of them-
selves. Compromising images are used to 
blackmail them. […] There are often profound 
psychological reasons why children engage in 
risky activities, such as neglect and abuse’ [Eu-
ropese Commissie, 2015].

‘Optenet, an international IT security compa-
ny, reported that between 2006 and 2008 the 
number of pro-ana websites globally increased 
470% to more than 1,500 and social network-
ing and blogging has seen a surge in online 
pro-anorexia content’ [Hobbs, The Guardian, 6 
april 2011].

Vulnerability up Close

these risk factors possibly increase the vulnerability of girls who 
suffer from anorexia to becoming victims of (sexual) exploitation.

Although there are a few specific risk factors that could make 
girls with anorexia vulnerable to human trafficking, no evidence 
has been found that they have actually become victims of exploita-
tion, apart from the man who was convicted on appeal in 2013 for 
the trafficking of a girl whom he had got to know when she was a 
minor and intended to exploit when she reached adulthood.186 The 
court case and the two newspaper articles further show that the 
main threat is of sexual violence, such as the production and dis-
tribution of child pornography and grooming.187

2.3.3 Vigilance
This section explored the risk factors that could make girls suffering from anorexia nervosa vulnerable 
to human trafficking. Their vulnerability lies mainly in the taboos surrounding eating disorders, their 
isolation, psychological problems and search for acceptance outside their safe environment. Girls with 
anorexia could also face a greater risk of becoming a victim of human trafficking if they share explicit 
material on forums on the Internet and allow themselves to be taken in by so-called ‘pro-ana coaches’. 
On the other hand, there is scarcely any information to suggest that this supposed vulnerability is actu-
ally abused by human traffickers. There is in fact more cause for concern about the possible risk of sex-
ual violence against members of this group, as illustrated by the court case and the two news reports 
discussed in this analysis. On the basis of this exploratory analysis, this group is therefore assigned to 
the category ‘vigilance.

Professionals who work with girls who suffer from anorexia should obviously be alert to signs of 
sexual violence, and possibly also of exploitation. There is no immediate reason to conduct further re-
search or take specific measures. If it is decided to conduct further research, it should focus on the ac-
tivities of the so-called pro-ana coaches who offer their services on online forums, as well as exploring 
the possibilities of interviewing girls who suffer from anorexia and visit pro-ana websites for signs of 
sexual violence, and perhaps even of exploitation.

3  Civil war in Syria and potentially 
vulnerable children

Syrian child brides

On the basis of this initial study, Syrian child brides are estimated to be 
relatively vulnerable to human trafficking. Their vulnerability is connect-
ed mainly with familial and structural factors and is a consequence of their 
youth, their position of dependence on their husbands and the fact of 
being forced to marry by their families. The hidden nature of the phe-
nomenon makes it difficult to actively capture signs of sexual violence 
and human trafficking. There is no evidence of human trafficking in rela-
tion to this group. On the basis of this exploratory research, Syrian child brides have been assigned 
to the category ‘research and prevention’.

Children who join or wish to join ISIS

On the basis of this initial study, the group of children who join or wish 
to join ISIS is estimated to be moderately vulnerable to human traffick-
ing. The main finding is that it is difficult to classify this group of chil-
dren according to strictly defined profiles in terms of vulnerability. 
Their vulnerability appears to arise mainly from individual factors. It is 
also difficult to say whether human traffickers specifically target these 
children because so little is known about the methods and intentions 
of recruiters for ISIS. At present, there is no evidence of human trafficking within the meaning of 
Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC). On the basis of this exploratory research, the group 
of children who join or wish to join ISIS has been assigned to the category ‘vigilance’.

3.1 Introduction

In the midst of a lengthy civil war in Syria, on 29 June 2014 Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) pro-
claimed a worldwide caliphate united in a single state governed by a ‘Caliph’. ISIS regards the Caliph, Abu 
Bakr al Baghdadi, as the successor of the Islamic prophet Mohammed. The caliphate claims religious, po-
litical and military authority over all Muslims and calls on Muslims worldwide to swear loyalty to the Caliph 
and to settle in ISIS territory.1 ISIS controls an area inhabited by more than ten million people, within 
which it commits war crimes and grave violations of human rights.2 
That is the reason why millions of men, women and children have 
left their homes and fled to safer regions. On 31 December 2015, 
4,602,203 Syrians were registered as refugees from the civil war.3 
The vast majority have fled to the neighbouring countries of Tur-
key, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.

In addition to the many victims and displaced persons that the 
conflict has created, there are also signs that it has increased the 
risk of human trafficking in the region.4 According to a report by 
the International Organization for Migration (IOM),5 for example, 
human traffickers have free rein in the region because of the effec-
tive absence of the rule of law. William Lacy Swing, the IOM’s Direc-
tor-General, has said of this: ‘The on-going conflict in Syria has 
forced many families and individuals to adopt harmful coping 
mechanisms such as forced early marriages and child labour, often 
resulting in exploitation and trafficking.’6 ISIS also exploits adults 
and children.7 The Yezidi girls and women who have been kept as slaves and forced to provide sexual ser-
vices are an appalling example of this.8

This chapter focuses on two distinct groups of children who might be vulnerable to human trafficking 
and have a link with the Netherlands as a result of the situation in Syria and parts of Iraq. The first group 
comprises children who fled to the Netherlands to escape the war, while the second group consists of

‘Trafficking in persons is typically not consid-
ered as a direct consequence of a crisis. This 
misplaced assumption often hampers the field 
response to human trafficking cases, not only 
in terms of documentation, reporting, identifi-
cation and assistance to the victims, but also in 
the subsequent criminal investigation. Count-
er-Trafficking efforts are not necessarily under-
stood as immediate life-saving in an emergen-
cy situation. In reality, these efforts are a 
matter of life and livelihood for the Victims of 
Trafficking and should therefore be considered 
with as much priority as for any other crisis af-
fected population’ [IOM, 2015].

children who travel to Syria and/or Iraq to join ISIS. The former group comprises underage Syrian girls who 
have been forced to marry an older man in their country of origin or in a refugee camp and are living or 
intend to live in the Netherlands.9 According to written information from the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service (IND), between 24 July 2014 and 18 February 2016 there had been approximately 210 Syrian child 
brides living in the Netherlands.10 The second group is made up of boys and girls who travelled or wished 
to travel from the Netherlands to join ISIS in Syria and/or Iraq. According to figures from the National Co-
ordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (NCTV), up to October 2015, 220 Dutch nationals had travelled 
to join ISIS,11 including minors who had decided to leave on their own and children who were taken abroad 
by their parents.

Although at first glance these two groups seem to have little in common, they are united by the fact that 
both have been mentioned in connection with human trafficking in other studies and/or in the media. The 
question, however, is to what extent these groups are actually vulnerable to human trafficking and wheth-
er human traffickers specifically target them. One of the difficulties in answering these questions is the 
often hidden nature of both of these phenomena, taking place as they do within the household, on the 
(encrypted) Internet, on social media and/or in other countries. This chapter presents an initial study of 
both groups of children, which is based, since there has been little research into either group, on explora-
tory research, anecdotal material12 and reports that have reached the National Rapporteur.

3.2 Syrian child brides

The number of Syrian refugees has risen steadily since the start of 
the country’s civil war in 2011. While most of them have fled to the 
neighbouring countries of Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, 
16,65513 Syrians requested asylum in the Netherlands between 
January and September 2015.14 The journey to the Netherlands is 
expensive and not without danger. In 2014, it was principally Syr-
ian men who came to the Netherlands.15 In addition to requesting 
asylum, some of these men also applied for family reunification. 
In 2015, however, reports started appearing that families were in 
fact sending their children to Europe in the belief that this would 
increase the chance of a positive decision on an application for 
family reunification.16 The Ministry of Security and Justice dis-
missed this reasoning, however, and said that it made the chance

of family reunification in the Netherlands neither greater nor smaller. Europol reports that child refu-
gees are vulnerable to sexual violence and human trafficking,17 so it is worrying that more than 10,000 
children have reportedly crossed the Syrian border without their parents and that more than half of the 
Syrian refugees in the region are minors.18

3.2.1 Syrian child brides
It is not only the number of refugees that poses a challenge for the Netherlands, it is also the fact that 
the refugees arriving in the Netherlands are vulnerable to human trafficking.19 This section focuses on 
one specific group of Syrian children who have come to the Netherlands and seem to be particularly 
vulnerable to sexual violence, and possibly also to human trafficking.20 These are Syrian child brides,21 
girls who married before their 18th birthday in Syria or in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.22 
According to a report by UNICEF, child marriages23 have been an 
accepted practice in Syria for a long time, but the number of 
such marriages has risen substantially since the start of the Syr-
ian civil war in 2011.24 Reasons given for the increase are the 
worsening economic conditions of the brides’ families and the 
unsafe situation for underage girls in Syria and in the refugee 
camps.25 A family can ease its economic difficulties by marrying 
off an underage daughter. Families also believe that a marriage brings sutra26 for the young girl, that a 
marriage will ensure that their traditions are continued and that it is a way for girls to escape an unsafe 
environment. On that latter point, it has been found that girls in Syria or in refugee camps marry in

civil war in Syria and come to Europe are also generally a vulnerable group for human trafficking, according to Eu-
ropol. See, for example, Sharifi, 6 November 2015 and Feenstra, 16 January 2016, ‘Mensenhandel actief rond asiel-

order to secure protection against abuse or rape.27 Although the number of child marriages is growing, 
it seems that, since the start of the civil war, the families of brides are less insistent in demanding 
guarantees for the girls’ welfare as an essential condition for an arranged marriage. According to 
UNICEF, this increases the risk that the girl who is being forced to marry will suffer sexual violence and 
exploitation.28 The factors that could make Syrian child brides vulnerable to sexual violence and ex-
ploitation are reviewed in the following sections.29

3.2.2  Syrian child brides, sexual violence and human trafficking
Minors are, by definition, in a position of dependence, which 
can make them vulnerable. The risk of suffering sexual violence 
and exploitation is possibly even greater for Syrian child brides 
because they are often forced to marry older men they do not 
know30 (an age gap of ten years is not uncommon).31 After all, 
the position of an unmarried girl living in a refugee camp and on 
the journey to Europe is dangerous and uncertain, with a greater 
chance that she will be sexually abused or raped.32 Although in 
such cases an arranged marriage can provide protection against 
sexual violence by other men in the short term, research has also 
shown that girls in arranged marriages generally become in-
creasingly dependent on their adult husband and that the ar-
ranged marriage can lead to an unsafe situation within the mar-
riage.33 For example, married girls abandon their schooling 
sooner34 and can become victims of sexual violence by being 
expected to be sexually active at a young age, before they are 
physically and emotionally ready.35

between five and fifteen years.

34 Research has shown that few girls who marry at a young age continue and complete their education, even when it 

was a condition for the marriage. The demands of married life and motherhood almost always take priority. Never-
theless, more research is needed to confirm the causality (UNICEF, 2014: p. 9).

possibly play a role in combating them.

tended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mor-
tality and morbidity, […], as well as increasing

Vulnerability up Close

It has also been found that girls who marry at a young age often 
become pregnant shortly after the consummation of the mar-
riage and can consequently face greater health risks.36 In addi-
tion, in most cases the girl is expected to care for the children 
and the household.37 The danger is that (sooner or later) these 
girls will disappear into the home, become so-called ‘hidden 
women’38 and be forced into complete subservience to their 
husband.39

3.2.3 Syrian child brides in the Netherlands
On 28 September 2015, a news report drew national attention to the issue of Syrian girls living in the 

Netherlands and married to adult men.40 The report prompted 
considerable political and public outrage. The ages at which the 
girls were married ranged from thirteen to seventeen.41 Asked 
how many child brides there are in the Netherlands, the State Sec-
retary for Security and Justice said: ‘Child brides are not recorded 
separately in the Immigration and Naturalisation Service’s regis-
tration system. In response to various signals, the IND has been 
keeping manual records. These records only provide a rough indi-
cation from which no firm conclusions can be drawn.’42 In re-
sponse to the State Secretary’s statement, the National Rappor-
teur asked the IND how many child brides there were according to 
the manual records.43 The records showed that roughly 230 child 

36 Research has shown that having a child at a young age causes greater health risks for both the mother and the child 
(UNICEF, 2014: p. 30). See also Save the Children, 2014.

37 Save the Children, 2014.
38 These girls can be linked to the phenomenon of ‘hidden women’. Drost et al. define hidden women as follows: 

‘women who are forced by their partner and/or family or family-in-law to live in isolation from others’. This is often 
accompanied by psychological intimidation or even physical violence. They are kept at home against their will and 
are allowed to have no contact or only very limited contact with the community’. In fact, neither study covered situ-
ations of human trafficking because each of these situations have their own problems and approach, according to 
the researchers (Drost et al. 2012). See also Drost et al. 2015.

39 Save the Children says the following about this: ‘The greater the age difference, the more likely girls are to be disempowered and 
at risk of violence, abuse or exploitation’ (Save the Children, 2014: p. 6). See also International Center for Research on 
Women, 2007: p. 10 and Child Protection and Gender-Based Violence Sub-Working Group Jordan, 2013: p 29.

41 The group of children must also be understood to include boys who are married at a young age and are eighteen 
years or older when they arrive in the Netherlands.

42 Parliamentary Documents II 2015/16, schedule number 639.
43 The IND noted the following constraints and reservations in relation to the figures: ‘Child brides are not separately 

registered in the IND registration system. In order to give an indication, since the end of 2014 the IND has kept rough 
manual records of reports of principal persons who have an underage spouse. In other words, these reports relate 
not only to underage spouses in a procedure for a residence permit or asylum, but also to principal persons who 
inform us that they have an underage partner or spouse in another country for whom no procedure has yet started. 
The method of gathering and registering information gives a limited impression and is indicative. No firm conclu-
sions can be based on it’ (written information from IND, 19 February 2016).

‘My father forced me to get married because he 
heard about a rape case nearby. He was scared 
the same would happen to my sister and me. He 
forced my sister to get married first, and then he 
made me get married right after that. It was all 
very forceful and I had no choice. I didn’t want to 
get married. I would’ve liked to finish my stud-
ies, but I couldn’t do that’. [Maha, 13 year old, 
The Guardian 2014]

‘According to Ineke van Winden of the Centre 
against Child Trafficking and Trafficking (CKM) 
in Leeuwarden, in many cases they are trauma-
tized teenagers. “These girls are still children. 
They usually come from Syrian refugee camps 
in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, where they 
were forced to marry. They actually require 
help. Once they are captive in a forced mar-
riage, there is a serious risk of further traumas”’

brides had been reported to the IND between 24 July 2014 and 18 February 2016.44 The total number 
of Syrian child brides was approximately 210.45 The reports were mainly from individuals who said 
they had an underage spouse in another country.46 The IND estimates that 60 child brides entered the 
Netherlands between 1 September 2015 and 18 January 2016 with-
out a residence permit, accompanied by their husband or other-
wise.47 In addition, ten requests were made for child brides to join 
their husband in this country in the context of family reunifica-
tion during that period.48 The youngest child bride registered with 
the IND in the period between 24 July 2014 and 18 January 2016 
was fourteen years of age, and in most cases, the age gap between 
the bride and the husband was between five and fifteen years.49 
Furthermore, there were cases of girls who were married at a very young age (between the ages of 
twelve and fifteen) in Syria or in one of the neighbouring countries, but who were older when they 
arrived in this country.50

In the Netherlands, these girls are still vulnerable to sexual violence, and possibly also to human traf-
ficking. Depending on their age,51 the members of this group face the risk of becoming victims of sexual 
violence within the marriage,52 including sexual assault53 and rape.54 In addition to the risk factors dis-
cussed above, these girls are in a country where they usually do not have a network of their own and are 

44 The manual registration commenced on 24 July 2014 and the figures mentioned in this document are rounded off 
to the nearest ten.

45 There were also reports during this period of child bride cases connected with other countries, such as Iraq (10) and 
Eritrea (10). 

46 ‘These reports contain various signals, such as underage spouses in a procedure for a residence permit, but also 
underage spouses who have travelled to the Netherlands together with the principal person and have entered the 
asylum procedure (request for an independent asylum procedure)’ (written information from the IND, 19 February 
2016). 

47 Written information from the IND, 19 February 2016.
48 The youngest person for whom family reunification was requested was twelve. However, the youngest person for 

whom a request for family reunification was granted was fifteen (written information from the IND, 19 February 
2016). 

49 Written information from the IND, 19 February 2016.
50 An estimated 110 of the 230 reports, evenly distributed throughout the period, were reviewed to ascertain at what 

age the girls were married. The distribution for each age group is as follows (rounded off to tens and although Syr-
ians are by far the largest group, other nationalities were also included): 12 years: <10; 13 years: 10; 14 years: 20; 15 
years: 20; 16 years: 30; 17 years: 30. 

51 For example, children under the age of sixteen are considered to be minors with regard to sexual consent, which in 
principle means that having sex with these children constitutes sexual assault. 

52 Save the Children, 2014; ICRW, 2005. See also UN Resolution A/HRC/29/L.15, which builds on two earlier resolutions 
(Resolutions 24/23 of 27 September 2013 and 69/156 of 18 December 2014) calling on States to intensify efforts to 
prevent child marriages.

53 Committing indecent acts with children under the age of sixteen is a criminal offence in the Netherlands by virtue 
of Articles 245 and 247 DCC. However, these articles contain the phrase ‘out of marriage’, which means that the in-
decent acts defined in those articles are not crimes within marriage. 

54 Rape is a criminal offence under Article 242 DCC in the Netherlands. There have in fact been disturbing reports of 
Syrian girls being raped in asylum camps and then forced to marry the rapist in order to restore the family’s honour 
(Save the Children, 2014). 

‘Sexual violence is inherent within child mar-
riage: sex with a child under the minimum age 
for consent and unwanted sexual relationships 
are gross violations of a child’s rights, regard-
less of whether they take place within the con-
text of a marriage’ [Save the Children, 2014].

Vulnerability up Close

unfamiliar with the culture, the language or the law.55 This makes them particularly vulnerable, because 
they do not know how to protect themselves against violence and abuse and a possible situation of ex-
ploitation, nor do they know where they can turn to for help and 
protection. Consequently, if a girl does suffer sexual violence and/
or exploitation, it can continue for a long time.

A factor that can further complicate and sustain a girl’s vul-
nerability is the risk of ‘honour-related violence’.56 This is a term 
used to connote ‘the motive for committing or threatening 
violence’,57 usually connected with the assumed duty to defend 
the family’s honour,58 for example if the girl seeks a divorce.59 
The family uses the threat or use of violence (usually carried out 
by a family member) in order to preserve its honour.60 The prac-
tice is not reserved to immediate family members such as parents 
or brothers and sisters, but can also be carried out by grandpar-
ents, aunts, uncles and cousins.61 Nidos, the Dutch child guardi-
anship agency, reported a case where a Syrian girl was threatened 
by family members to prevent her from requesting a divorce.62 In other cases, honour revenge has been 
regarded as a possible risk factor when decisions were being made on whether spouses should be held 
in detention separately.63 All of these factors can contribute to the vulnerability of Syrian child brides to 
sexual violence and exploitation. However, there have been no specific signs of human trafficking oc-
curring during the period that Syrian child brides have been living in the Netherlands.64

child marriages (Batha, 4 December 2013, ‘Syrian War Causing ‘Honour Killings’, Child Marriages’, Thomson Reuters 
Foundation, available at http://www.trust.org/item/20131204182854-8hegf/, consulted on 5 August 2015).

‘With honour-related violence, mental or physi-
cal violence is employed to protect the family’s 
honour or to restore its honour. The threat of 
honour-related violence (including honour kill-
ing) or of ostracization by their family can make 
a woman fearful of altering her situation, for 
example by getting a divorce. She therefore goes 
along with the situation. In the eyes of the hid-
den women divorce is a scandal, it is not permit-
ted and it is wrong. A divorce seriously offends 
the family’s honour. With all the ensuing conse-
quences’ [Drost et al. 2015].

3.2.4  Arranged marriages, Syrian child brides and the possible link with human 
trafficking

The question is what forms the exploitation of these girls could take and whether they fall within the 
scope of the human trafficking article in the Dutch Criminal Code.65 The premise of the EU’s Human 
Trafficking Directive is that human trafficking must not be defined by the location and context within 
which it occurs; if the elements of the offence can be proved, it is human trafficking regardless of the 
sector or (cultural) setting in which it has taken place.66 A link can also be made between arranged mar-
riages and human trafficking.67 In the context of the problems discussed in this chapter, one should 
think mainly in terms of the situation of dependence on her partner that a girl finds herself in when she 
is forced to marry. Although there is no evidence of it occurring at the moment, this situation could 
eventually lead to exploitation, for example if the girl is kept in continuous servitude for years, as was 
demonstrated in a case in which a couple required their ten-year-old niece to perform domestic work 
for them for years, without allowing her to go to school. The girl literally disappeared behind the front 
door, removed from public view. In this case the court found as follows:68

Continuous servitude
The suspect and her partner exploited their niece [victim], who was in a position of vulnerability, 
for seven years. [Victim] came to a strange country at the age of ten, where she did not speak the 
language and did not know its customs. [Victim] was in a disadvantaged position in the family […]. 
In contrast to the other children in the family, [victim] did not go to school. Instead, she had to 
perform household chores and care for the other children.[…]. If [victim] did not meet the expecta-
tions of [suspect] […], she was beaten, verbally abused and humiliated by the couple. Nor was any 
health insurance taken out for [victim] and during the time she stayed with the suspect […] she was 
not able to visit a doctor or a dentist. […] [Victim] felt trapped. By their actions, for years the suspect 
and her partner violated [victim’s] fundamental human rights, her human dignity and her per-
sonal liberty, and did so during her formative years, a period when she was actually entitled to 
expect love, support and assistance from her family. The suspect harmed the mental integrity of 
[victim] and placed her own and her husband’s personal comfort above that integrity. Through her 
actions, the suspect deprived [victim] of a free and untroubled childhood.69

In the Netherlands, the question of whether the situation of dependence on her spouse in which a Syr-
ian child bride can find herself actually crosses over into exploitation is answered on the basis of the 
legislation on human trafficking (Article 273f DCC) in combination with the interpretation of that legis-
lation in the case law. According to the Supreme Court, relevant factors in assessing whether there was 
an intention to exploit another person70 are the nature and duration of the work that had to be per-
formed, the restrictions that the work imposed on the victim and the economic benefit gained by the 
person employing the victim, in this case the husband. 71 In the opinion of the Supreme Court, that as-

sessment should be based on the standards that apply in the Netherlands; it is irrelevant, for example, 
that the situation concerned is acceptable under other frames of reference (the Syrian context, for ex-
ample). The Supreme Court recently ruled that the assessment of these factors can lead to a different 
outcome in the case of underage victims than in the case of adult victims. This finding can be under-
stood as an exhortation to take explicit account of the fact that the possible victim was a minor in as-
sessing whether there was the intention of exploitation.72

3.2.5 Prevention and research
This initial study has identified various factors that could make Syrian child brides vulnerable to human 
trafficking. Potential risk factors are their isolation, the increased threat of sexual violence, their posi-
tion of considerable dependence on their husband and their lack of familiarity with the customs and 
laws in the Netherlands and the agencies they can turn to for help if they become victims of sexual vio-
lence or exploitation. These are worrying aspects. On the other hand, there are no explicit signs that 
human trafficking occurs within this group. On the basis of this initial exploratory analysis, the group 
of Syrian child brides is therefore assigned to the category ‘Research and prevention’.

The moral indignation that arose following the reports73 of the presence of Syrian child brides in the 
Netherlands led to the accelerated adoption of a bill for the prevention of forced marriages74 in the 
Dutch Senate on 6 October 2015. The effect of the law is that minors are no longer permitted to marry 
and that the Netherlands will no longer recognize marriages performed with minors in other coun-
tries.75 The law entered into force on 5 December 2015.76 The National Rapporteur had been an advocate 
of the Forced Marriage (Prevention) Act for some time, but the law does not mean that all of the prob-
lems have been resolved at the stroke of a pen. The Netherlands may no longer recognize child mar-
riages, but the spouses and the community could still regard the marriage as valid. It might therefore be 
expected that agreements made and payments promised still have to be complied with. This creates the 
risk that the marriages will informally remain in force and that married girls might disappear from view 
entirely for fear of being separated from their partner. This is a situation that poses challenges that can-
not be resolved solely by a change in the law.

The law does not affect marriages that have already been recognized. The State Secretary for Security 
and Justice has said that it is not legally possible to annul a marriage that has already been performed and 
recognized.77 However, he did promise to identify the vulnerable girls concerned and, where possible, 
offer them separate and secure shelter and medical and psychological help.78 Various partners in the 
chain have a role to play in protecting these girls, including Nidos, the IND, the Central Agency for the 
Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA), the Child Care and Protection Board, the National Expertise Centre

ter is more appropriate is reviewed’ (Parliamentary Documents II 2015-2016, schedule number 639).

for Honour-Related Violence (LEC EGG) and the National Centre for Forced Marriage and Abandonment.79 
But how can these girls be monitored closely enough to intervene and protect them if there are signs of 
sexual violence or human trafficking and to prevent them from ending up as ‘hidden women’.80 That calls 
for the creation of opportunities to establish contact with these girls so that problems that might suggest 
they are experiencing sexual violence and/or exploitation can be spotted at an early stage.81 These con-
tacts could be arranged, for example, in asylum centres, in schools,82 and during appointments with 
family doctors,83 hospitals and social community teams84 and possibly at child health clinics.85 It is also 
important to monitor girls who have split up with their partner, and, if necessary, provide protection and 
intensive counselling for them.86

Another possible consequence of the Forced Marriage (Preven-
tion) Act is that Syrian child brides and/or their partners will search 
for alternative ways of remaining together. For example, a girl might 
apply for asylum, together with her family, in the European country 
where her husband is already living.87 Once she has secured resi-
dence status, she can then join her husband.88 This makes it difficult 
for agencies like Nidos, the COA and the IND to discover these mar-
riages or do anything to prevent them. For example, there have been 
cases where Syrian men have applied for asylum in the Netherlands 
and said they were married to a Syrian girl, but have not made a re-
quest for their bride to be allowed to join them. The authorities 
should be particularly on their guard with members of this group 
and remain alert if the child bride does later join her husband, for 

79 Parliamentary Documents II 2015 – 2016, schedule number 477.
80 See also the study by Drost et al. into hidden women, which shows that these women are difficult to reach and that 

‘it often takes years before a hidden woman realizes that she deserves more than a life in forced isolation and that 
this situation is not good for her or her children. Only when the hidden woman herself has realized that the situa-
tion cannot continue is she willing to accept help’ (Drost et al. 2015: p. 8–9).

81 As suggested in the study by Drost et al. into hidden women, the measures already developed in relation to domes-
tic violence could also be adopted for Syrian child brides (Drost et al. 2015: p. 10).

82 These girls fall under the obligation to follow education or obtain a qualification, whereby the calendar age is deci-
sive. See also the Compulsory Education Act.

they encounter a possible victim. The handbook can be found at www.payoke.be/websites/52/uploads/file/Guide

85 If domestic violence occurs, Veilig Thuis could also pay a role (http://www.informatiehuiselijkgeweld.nl/, consulted

86 The study into hidden women by Drost et al. found that it is important for social agencies with sufficient expertise 
in the field to closely monitor women who have split up with their partner (Drost et al. 2015: p. 9).

87 State Secretary Dijkhoff also referred to this problem in a plenary debate on 30 September 2015, when he said that 
the relevant agencies must be alert to it (see Parliamentary Documents II 2015 – 2016, 19637, no. 2080). 

88 The National Centre for Forced Marriage and Abandonment ‘identifies the risk that some Syrian refugees want their 
underage daughters to have a religious marriage in the Netherlands. The centre has taken active steps with the rel-
evant national partners to determine how to deal with these children and to review working arrangements where 
necessary’ (Parliamentary Documents II 2015 – 2016, schedule number 639).

‘A hidden woman has little freedom of move-
ment. Most of her life is spent indoors. She is 
sometimes literally locked up in the home. The 
husband dictates, dominates and controls her 
life. She has no possibility to shape her own life 
or to make her own choices. Chatting with the 
neighbour, bringing the children to school or 
going shopping are usually forbidden or only 
allowed under strict supervision or with an es-
cort. The women are subdued by psychological 
intimidation or even physical violence’ [Drost 
et al. 2015].

example when he has been granted asylum and has settled in a municipality. A second group of child 
brides that could arrive in the Netherlands via an alternative route are girls who have previously lived with 
their husband and had children with him. On the basis of Article 8 of the European Convention on Hu-
man Rights (Article 8), they could invoke the family life89 criterion in making an application for family re-
unification. If so, consideration will have to be given to how these girls and their children can best be 
protected.

The problem is not confined to the Netherlands. Although there 
is no clear picture of the situtation, other EU member states, in-
cluding Norway,90 Denmark,91 Sweden and Germany92 are also 
confronted with Syrian child brides.93 If the Netherlands is uni-
laterally able to put an end to these child marriages, there is 
likely to be a waterbed effect. In other words, couples will move 
to European countries where child marriages are allowed. It is 
therefore important for the Netherlands to actively seek coop-
eration with other member states in pursuit of a common course 
of action against child marriages and so ensure that these girls 
are protected throughout Europe.

The Forced Marriage (Prevention) Act could also have the ef-
fect of preventing girls who are married from coming to the Neth-
erlands by means of an application for family reunification. 
Speaking on behalf of the organization Girls not Brides, Princess 
Mabel of Orange has said that it cannot have been the intention 
that the law would have the effect of forcing underage girls to remain behind alone in a refugee camp.94 
Ways of protecting members of this group against sexual violence and human trafficking will also have 
to be explored, since the change in the law must not result in these girls ending up in a worse situation 
than if they had come to the Netherlands.

basis of the ‘actual family ties’ criterion (Article 29 (1)(e) and (f ) of the Aliens Act). On this criterion, see also Strik et 
al. 2012.

The youngest girl was eleven years of age. At least ten girls were below the age of sixteen when they were registered. 
Most of the girls came from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan (Lupi, 2 February 2016, ‘Minors as Young as 11 Already Married

92 In Germany, Syrian child brides are treated as unaccompanied minor aliens, so the German guardianship agency 
exercises authority over them and they can be separated from their husbands (Zeronian, 22 October 2015, ‘Fear Rises

not necessary. She experienced an extreme form 
of forced dependence with no networks, no lan-

left him. She was simply not able to go. This 
way the marriage turns into a coercive mecha-
nism, a position of power that could be exploit-
ed. Being in a situation of power is of course 
not enough in itself for a person to be classified 
as a trafficker. Marriages with uneven power 
balances and a high degree of dependence are 
not uncommon […]. But when this dependence 
is systematically exploited it starts to look like 
trafficking’ [Tyldum, 2013].

Finally, the United Nations has adopted resolutions drawing at-
tention to the need to protect women who are forced into marriage 
as children.95 There are most likely also Syrian women In the Neth-
erlands who were still children when they married but were adults 
when they applied for asylum with their husband. Even after reach-
ing the age of majority, these women still face an increased risk of 
psychological and physical problems and various forms of violence, 
including sexual violence and possibly also exploitation. The Unit-
ed Nations also calls for attention for this group.

even more concerned about what will happen

3.3 Children who join or want to join ISIS

ISIS controls an area inhabited by more than 10 million people in which it commits war crimes and grave 
violations of human rights.96 While millions of people have fled from the violence of ISIS, many thou-
sands from different regions of the world are also travelling to 
Syria and Iraq97 to join ISIS.98 According to the Soufan Group, 
5,000 men, women and children have travelled to Syria from 
Western Europe,99 most of the men and boys to join ISIS as fight-
ers. Since 2014, a growing number of women and girls have also 
travelled to territory controlled by ISIS, for example to marry a ji-
hadist fighter.100

The NCTV has reported that roughly 220 people had travelled 
from the Netherlands to Syria and Iraq in the period up to 1 Octo-
ber 2015. Approximately 40 of them have since returned and almost the same number have died in the 
fighting.101 Between February 2013 and 8 June 2015, the Child Care and Protection Board investigated 58 
unique jihad-related cases involving 37 children who had left the country with their families and 21 
minors who had travelled alone as potential jihadists.102 According to a report by the General Intelli-
gence and Security Service (AIVD) entitled Life with ISIS: the Myth Unravelled, ‘at least 70 Dutch children 
are living in territory controlled by jihadists in Syria and Iraq, the large majority of them with ISIS’.103 
These are children who were either born there or taken there by one or both of their parents.

This section deals with minors who have travelled or planned to travel to Syria or Iraq without their 
parents.104 Since little research has been carried out on this subject, this study is based mainly on a 
number of exploratory surveys, anecdotal material105 and signals from the professional field.

96 See the following documents from the United Nations illustrating this: A/HRC/27/60S-17/2/Add.1; A/HRC/19/69, A/
HRC/ 21/50; A/HRC/22/59; A/HRC/23/58; A/HRC/24/46 and A/HRC/25/65.

97 Barret, 2014; AIVD, 2016. 
98 Although there are other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq that young people from the West have joined, such as 

Jahbat al-Nusra, this section focuses on ISIS. This decision is based in part on the report by the AIVD, which said that 
Dutch youths prefer to join ISIS rather than the traditional branches of Al Qaida, including Jabhat al-Nusra (AIVD, 
2016: p. 3).

104 There are also concerns about children who have been taken by one or both of their parents to ISIS. For example, 
children are prepared from a young age (the age of nine) for the conflict and also fight at the front. ‘Whereas child 
soldiers were formerly forced to fight, the young ISIS fighters are so indoctrinated with radical Islam that they vol-
untarily commit the most gruesome acts’ (Van der Bas, 24 July 2014, ‘Schokkend: ISIS gebruikt steeds vaker kindsol-

3.3.1 Jihadism, radicalization and recruitment
The NCTV defines the term ‘jihadism’ as a specific, highly radical interpretation of Islam.106 Whereas 
Islam is a world religion, jihadism can be seen as a political ideology. Jihadists are convinced that a ‘holy 
war’ has to be fought against anything that deviates from the ‘pure 
doctrine’,107 a simple message that seems to appeal to certain 
groups of men, women and children.

No child is born a terrorist. To understand how a child becomes a 
terrorist it is necessary, according to the NCTV, to consider two pro-
cesses: radicalization and recruitment. The NCTV defines radicalism 
as follows: ‘The active pursuit of and/or support for fundamental 
changes in society that may endanger the continued existence of the democratic legal order (aim), which 
may involve the use of undemocratic methods (means) that may harm the functioning of the democratic 
order (effect)’.108 According to the NCTV, radicalization is a social process, while ‘recruitment is a form of 
“direction” that taps into radicalization and seeks to channel it in the direction of violence. In order to 
tackle terrorism effectively, it is therefore important not to view these processes as separate, but to ap-
proach them in conjunction with each other.’109

3.3.2 Similarities and differences compared with human trafficking
The link between radicalization, recruitment, the jihad and human trafficking is being made more fre-
quently.110 For example, there have been references in exploratory studies111 and national and interna-
tional media to jihad loverboys,112 and trafficking in women in combination with boys and girls travelling

106 The term ‘jihadism’ has a number of definitions (Streusand, 1997), not all of which relate to the armed conflict. The 
NCTV’s definition is followed in this study.

than a premeditated loverboy-like plan to recruit girls’ (Groen and Kranenburg, 2006: p. 57). In 2015, De Telegraaf 
also referred to jihad loverboys. The lawyer Michael Ruperti was quoted as saying: ‘These girls are approached, 
charmed, poisoned with extremist ideologies and persuaded to travel to IS territory with loverboy-like practices’

‘Although global jihadism is often linked to po-
litical Islam (Islamism), and indeed to some 
extent relies on the same sources, it in fact rep-
resents a radical break with Islamism as a po-
litical movement’ [NCTV, 2014].

to territory controlled by ISIS.113 Rob Wainwright, the head of 
Europol, also referred to the possible connection with human 
trafficking in 2015.114 This section looks more closely at the pos-
sible link between human trafficking and the recruitment of 
young people for ISIS on the basis of the three following ques-
tions:

I. Are there possible similarities in terms of vulnerability?
II. Are there possible similarities in terms of recruitment?
III. Is there possibly exploitation in the recruitment of children for ISIS?

This section concludes with a discussion of the differences between young people who are victims of 
human trafficking and those who are possibly recruited for ISIS and who travel or wish to travel to join 
it.

3.3.3 Possible similarities in terms of vulnerability
Research has shown that human traffickers take advantage of the vulnerabilities of minors in order to 
draw them into a situation of exploitation and keep them there.115 Although some young people know-
ingly travel to Syria and Iraq in order to join a terrorist organization, various studies have shown that 
some might have been in a vulnerable position before the process of radicalization and recruitment 
commenced.116 It is not known whether recruiters for ISIS have taken advantage of that vulnerability 
and, if so, to what extent. What is known is that the vulnerability of these young people can arise from 
a personal crisis, such as the death of a close relative,117 a bad situation at home,118 the lack of good fu-
ture prospects119 or a sense of social exclusion.120 This vulnerability can prompt these youngsters to 
search for meaning in their lives or a new personal identity, making them more susceptible to new 
ideas and world views.121

According to the NCTV, socio-economic conditions and relative deprivation are also potential breed-
ing grounds for radicalization.122 Psychological processes are another possible explanation for a per-
son’s vulnerability to radicalization and susceptibility to recruit-
ment.123 For example, by nature people have two deep-seated 
needs: to have an individual identity, and at the same time to be 
part of a group.124 Young people who do not feel they receive respect 
as individuals or acceptance by a group might be particularly sus-
ceptible to adopting a radical religious identity.125 ‘What this iden-
tity offers above all is security, (absolute) certainty and the kind of 
unconditional love that many people (young adults in particular) 
long for. Loneliness, a sense of being left to one’s own devices in a 
hyper-individualistic society and all the attendant pressures (not least the pressure to perform) can drive 
people to join others who think the same way and embrace radical ideas that offer a refuge’.126

Other elements apart from a vulnerable background can also help to explain why young people join 
ISIS. Feddes et al.127 mention group pressure as an important factor, and Bovenkerk and Roex128 refer to 
the existence of a new jihadist youth culture in which important motives for joining ISIS are greed and 
a desire for adventure and romance.129

There are also a growing number of reports of girls leaving home to join ISIS,130 many of them departing 
for Syria and Iraq in order to marry or to actively work for ISIS.131 The explanations given for ISIS’s appeal to

‘final push’ to travel to Syria (Bakker and Grol, 2015). 
124 NCTV, 2014: p. 21.
125 See also Noor, who has researched the motives of girls who have joined ISIS. She says that one of the reasons female 

Muslims are susceptible to radicalization is that ‘young Muslim women live under enormous psychological pressure 
and that pressure can lead to vulnerability and emotional isolation’. In combination with intensive events in their 
lives, according to Noor, this can lead to ‘religion becoming the most important coping mechanism for finding stabil-
ity in a difficult situation’ (Noor, 2016: p. 6).

126 NCTV, 2014: p. 21.According to the NCTV, it is also not surprising that young people with a criminal record feel an 
attraction to jihadism. ‘Jihadists appeal to young people’s feelings of guilt about their sinful life and offer them an 
easy way out […] that quickly leads to redemption, atonement and a strong social identity from which a new status 
can be derived‘ (NCTV, 2014: p. 22).

129 See also Barrett, 2014. A similar observation is made in the report by the Soufan Group: ‘A search for belonging, purpose,

issues in the international fight against terrorism’ (Soufan Group, 2015: p. 6).

male or female, armed or not, is playing an active part in ISIS’s struggle’ (AIVD, 2016: p. 15). However, although 
women would like to fight with ISIS, they are not permitted to at the moment (AIVD, 2016). 

‘I have come to understand trafficking as sys-
tematic exploitation of vulnerabilities. Howev-

Vulnerability up Close

girls are that they have a romanticized image of life in the ‘Caliphate’,132 no longer want to live among 
apostates, see it as their duty as a Muslim to travel to Iraq and Syria and support ISIS and/or because they 
feel they have been dishonoured133 and hope that by joining ISIS they can start a new life.134 Noor asserts135 
that these assumed motives can be clustered under one or more of the following motives: religious, po-
litical or romantic. In other words, girls feel called on by their reli-
gion to join ISIS; girls have the idea that Muslim communities 
around the world are under attack and wish to display their solidar-
ity with their fellow believers; or they want to marry an ISIS fighter 
from a desire for affection and romantic love.

Research by Noor into the motives of girls and women who 
have joined ISIS has shown that, although it is a diverse group, 
there are some similarities between them.136 For example, the ‘girls 
are usually from families where the parents are divorced; [from 
families] where the girls have experienced a form of traditional 
and/or cultural pressure; [from families] where they had difficulty 
shaping their identity because they felt a lack of stability [and from families] in which religion did not play 
an important role in their upbringing.137 In general, most girls also have a low level of education, there are 
a large number of early school leavers and some girls have also worked as prostitutes.138 Noor divides the 
females who have travelled to join ISIS into three ‘types’: 1) naïve, 2) idealistic and politically engaged and 
3) ideological. The vast majority fall into the first of these categories, according to Noor.139 They are primar-

132 ‘Recruiters frequently describe the glory and honor of being the wife of a jihadi living in utopia, without mention of the extreme violence per-
petrated by ISIS, or the possibility that these girls will contribute to, and find themselves subject to, such violence’ (PBS Frontline, 12 No-
vember 2014, ‘Examining the Rise of ISIS’, available at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/iraq-war-on- 
terror/rise-of-isis/how-isis-uses-sexual-predators-techniquesto-lure-western-women-podcast, consulted on 3 March 
2016).

133 For example, according to an article by Bloom and Winter, before their departure many girls and women were ‘dis-
honored’ in the eyes of their families and often had a history of sexual abuse and alcohol or drug use (Bloom and 
Winter, 7 December 2015 ‘The Women of ISIL’, Politico, available at http://www.politico.eu/article/the-women-of-isil-
female-suicide-bomber-terrorism/, consulted on 3 March 2016. In research by Noor it was also asserted that some 
Dutch female jihadist travellers had worked as prostitutes in the past (Noor, 2016). 

134 See, inter alia, Bloom, 9 October 2014, ‘How the Islamic State is Recruiting Western Teens, The Washington Post, available at

135 Noor, 2016: pp. 8- 9.
136 A reservation to be expressed about this study is that Noor’s information comes from a single expert who counselled 

fifteen female jihad travellers. ‘The anonymous expert bases her findings on her analysis of various deradicalization 
programmes for girls and women who travelled or were planning to travel to Syria or Iraq’ (Noor, 2016: p. 6).

137 Noor, 2016: p. 6. The  study by Wessels and Dijkman sketches a similar picture and they say that the girls were conse-
quently vulnerable and impressionable, ‘particularly in relation to groups that combine extreme loyalty to the group 
with a radical ideology’ (Wessels and Dijkman, 2012: p. 101).

138 Noor, 2016.
139 Naive (70%), idealistic-politically engaged (15%) and ideological (15%). It is argued that girls in the category ‘naïve’ 

are fed with religious one-liners by members of the other two categories. The ideological in particular are report-
edly often strong online recruiters for ISIS (Noor 2016: pp. 6-7). 

‘The men tend to become fighters much like 
previous generations of jihadists seeking out 
battlefields in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
But less is known about the Western women of 
the Islamic State. Barred from combat, they 
support the group’s state-building efforts as 
wives, mothers, recruiters and sometimes on-
line cheerleaders of violence’ [Bennhold, The 
New York Times, 17 augustus 2015].

ily sixteen or seventeen years old with a deep need for a guiding figure.140 Wessels and Dijkman write that 
among Muslim girls a feeling of isolation during puberty can contribute to their vulnerability and suscep-
tibility and lead to a greater risk of addiction, recruitment and sexual violence.141 Finally, it also appears that 
ISIS actively targets women in the West,142 for example in the belief that the presence of more girls and 
women will encourage more boys and men to join.143

The impression to emerge from this review is that those who become radicalized and/or are recruited 
come from different backgrounds.144 Young persons from a vulnerable background are not all equally 
susceptible to radicalization and recruitment.145 According to the AIVD, vulnerability does not mitigate 
the fact that a young person who travels to Syria and/or Iraq makes a conscious decision. The AIVD says: 
‘Anyone travelling to the so-called Islamic State is knowingly opting to join a terrorist group which re-
gards all outsiders as “infidels” and uses excessive violence on a daily basis.’146 Finally, it is evident that the 
young people who travel to join ISIS do not all have a vulnerable background. There are some who join 
because of an ideological conviction, in order to fight for what they regard as a legitimate cause or be-
cause they want to help in the war against the Assad regime.147

3.3.4 Possible similarities in terms of recruitment
ISIS makes considerable use of the Internet and social media in the process of radicalization and recruit-
ment.148 There are many stories circulating about its enormous propaganda machine and recruitment 
methods. For example, ISIS allegedly has at least 46,000 Twitter accounts with which it reaches millions 

140 According to Noor, these young people practice a detailed ISIS interpretation of Islam within two or three months 
(Noor 2016: p. 6). 

141 Wessels and Dijkman, 2012; Noor, 2016.
142 This was said by Abbee Corb, executive director of the International Institute for Radicalisation and Security Studies in the National 

Post (Bell, 17 November 2014, ‘Reported ISIS Recruitment of Women as Jihadist Brides Prompts Canadian Govern-
ment to Call for Study’, National Post, available at http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/reported-isis-recruit-
ment-of-women-as-jihadist-brides-prompts-canadian-government-to-call-for-study, consulted on 3 March 2016). 
Noor also argues that ISIS contact persons persuade girls to travel to join ISIS and marry a jihad fighter (Noor, 2016: 
p. 9).

143 Other reasons are that women can actively support ISIS by having as many children as possible as quickly as possible 
and raising their sons as ISIS fighters. Women can also recruit other women and producing ISIS propaganda is a key 
task for many of them. Some women also work as teachers or doctors, while others perform logistical tasks for ISIS. 
What all women have in common is that they make an active contribution to keep the terrorist organization ISIS 
running (AIVD, 2016: p. 8). Girls can marry from the age of nine and ISIS prefers children to be married before the 
age of sixteen or seventeen (Winter, 2015).

144 See also the exploratory study by Bakker and Grol in 2015. The NCTV has found the same thing and has written as 
follows: ‘The many studies that have been conducted into this subject indicate that there are no clear “roots” to be 
found for radicalization’ (Parliamentary Documents II 2014/15, 29754, no. 270, appendix 409858).

145 The same applies for victims of human trafficking. In addition to risk factors, protective factors probably also influ-
ence whether or not young people travel to join ISIS. See also Chapter 1.

146 The question is how this statement can be reconciled with the message in the AIVD report that ISIS creates a success 
story that does not correspond with reality. After all, its report ‘unravels the myth that ISIS presents in propaganda 
[…]’ and it is argued that ‘the great majority [of young people making the journey to join ISIS in Syria and/or Iraq] 
think they have a realistic picture of the life awaiting them’(AIVD, 2016: p. 5).

of followers.149 Its strategy seems to be to arouse the interest of vulnerable groups in ISIS, so that recruit-
ers can then establish contact with them on social media such as Kik, Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp,150 
applications that are designed for one-to-one contact.151 Ashton 
Carter, the United States’ Secretary of Defense, said at the begin-
ning of 2015: ‘This is a social media-fuelled terrorism group in a 
way we haven’t seen yet. People who are very distant from any 
battlefield, from any experience of radicalism, are suddenly be-
coming enticed through social media’.152 The process of radicali-
zation, and possibly recruitment, also occurs in more traditional 
locations such as mosques, schools and sports clubs, as well as 
places where young people hang out.153 The AIVD regards radi-
calization as ‘a social phenomenon that often takes place in both real and virtual life. The Internet is 
only a means to an end in this context, and serves as the “place” where part of the radicalization process 
transpires’.154 The Internet also seems to play an increasingly prominent role in the recruitment of vic-
tims of human trafficking,155 and in the case of human trafficking contact is also not only made online, 
but also in the real world.156

150 Noor also argues that recruiters for ISIS appear to use Facebook, for example, to recruit vulnerable girls (Noor, 2016: 
p. 9). 

151 ‘Social media such as Twitter or Facebook are highly effective in spreading a violent extremist ideology. They play a significant role in the 
recruitment and fundraising efforts of extremist groups such as ISIS and Jabhat al Nusra’ (Barret, 2014: p. 7).

152 Ibid.
153 On this point, the Soufan Group says the following: ‘There is […] more evidence of community based recruitment in countries 

with the highest numbers of foreign fighters, where groups of acquaintances are drawn into a common identity’. […] ‘While social media 
undoubtedly plays a role in the recruitment of fighters from Western Europe, it is—perhaps—understandable that, over time, people who 
have already gone to Syria reach out in person to their friends and acquaintances to encourage them to do the same. Recruitment efforts 
both on and offline appear to have become more insistent and better organized. The influence of returnees in this process is still unknown’ 
(The Soufan Group, 2015: p. 13).

154 AIVD, 2012: p. 9.
155 ‘Prior to the Internet [recruitment of victims] often required one to gain a position of trust from a location in which many children were 

present. Today, however with a computer or mobile device, one can encounter large amounts of minor children through social networking 
sites, newsgroups, internet chatrooms, etc. Therefore, that is frequently a location where a purchaser or trafficker will seek children for 
sexual exploitation’ (Leary, 2014: p. 31). See also European Commission, 2015; National Rapporteur, 2012: pp. 132 ff.

156 ‘It is predicted, however, that over time the majority of recruitment, just like the majority of relationship commencement outside of the 
criminal context, will occur online or through cellular telephones. But in person, recruiting will continue as long as it is fruitful’ (Leary, 
2013: p. 32).

‘ISIS has the most sophisticated propaganda 
machine of any terrorist organization, a global 
communications strategy that has stumped 
counterterrorism officials while making signif-
icant inroads among […] sympathizers. What 
we’re seeing is unprecedented, […] It’s a change 
in strategy’ [Sanchez, CNN, 5 juli 2015].

The method by which young boys and girls are recruited for the jihad is also sometimes similar to 
how human traffickers operate.157 Studies by Silber and Bhatt158 and Precht159 have shown that contact 
with a charismatic individual and/or a leader can produce a breakthrough in a young person’s radicaliza-
tion and can be seen as an important trigger factor.160 These persons address vulnerable youths on as-
pects such as their philosophy and identity. Research and media reports seem to suggest that these 
charismatic individuals and/or ‘leaders’ sometimes give young peo-
ple an unrealistic portrayal of what they can expect from life in the 
‘Caliphate’ in persuading them to join ISIS.161 The use of deception 
and untruths to persuade a person is a method that is also used to 
recruit persons with the intention of exploiting them.162

Studies into recruitment methods for the jihad also show that 
recruiters employ a strategy designed to build emotional and ro-
mantic relationships with vulnerable young people, while at the 
same time isolating them from their family and friends. Buijs et 
al.163 have written, for example, that recruiters for the jihad some-
times employ the technique of simultaneously gaining the trust of potential recruits and isolating them 
socially.164 With this method, also known as bridge burning,165 prospective members are encouraged or 
forced to break their other social ties if they wish to be accepted into the group. It is a method that 
greatly increases their dependence on and loyalty to the group.166 Research by Wessel and Dijkman into 
the scale, characteristics and causes of possible radicalization among female Muslims in Amsterdam 
painted a similar picture.167 It showed that vulnerable female Muslims can have an ‘extreme need for 
affection, love and respect and that they are sought within the family relationships and friendships, but 

157 The AIVD qualifies the impression that there are many recruiters and/or recruitees in the Netherlands, saying that 
‘the current jihadist movement has little hierarchy and fewer clear leaders than in the fluid networks that were active 
in the Netherlands in the first decade of this century. There is still a widespread belief that covert recruiters and 
controllers are at large, manipulating unwary youngsters into joining their struggle. But the true picture is less 
straightforward. In only one case has a hierarchical leader been found to have put pressure on members of “his” 
group to join the jihad abroad’ (AIVD, 2014: p 23). The Context case is also interesting in that regard. In that case the 
District Court in The Hague sentenced nine suspects to terms of imprisonment of up to six years. According to the 
court, six suspects were members of an organization engaged in recruiting, facilitating and financing young people 
who wished to travel to Syria to fight (The Hague District Court 10 December 2015, ECLI:NL: RBDHA:2015:14365).

161 But recruiters (insofar as they are charismatic figures and leaders who cannot be regarded as recruiters) and jihadist 

propaganda can present this unrealistic picture of life in the ‘Caliphate’ (see, inter alia, AIVD, 2016; Feddes et al. 2015; 
Bakker and Grol, 2015; Binetti, 2015).

164 Binetti, 2015.
165 Feddes et al. 2015; NCTV, 2014. 
166 In the opinion of Prudon and Doosje (2015), this method is very similar to the way in which sects operate. See also 

National Rapporteur, 2013: (§ 2.10), which includes a description of how a gang in the US exploited more than 100 
girls by creating dependence on and loyalty to the group. 

167 For their study Wessels and Dijkman sent a questionnaire to 155 female Muslims in Amsterdam, the large majority 
of whom (85.8%) were between the ages of 16 and 26. They then selected twelve of them for a narrative biographical 
interview (Wessels and Dijkman, 2012). 

‘The jihadist movement in the Netherlands is 
a small, but dangerous, extremist, sect-like 
group that propagates violence as the sole 
means of achieving its goals. […] Social media 
help in the rapid dissemination of the jihadist 
ideology, which is also proclaimed by preachers 
who incite hatred’ [Letter to parliament, 29 June 
2014].

also in romantic love’.168 The authors believe that this need ‘can lead to the creation of risky (loving) 
relationships, probably in the hope of receiving genuine affection’ and ‘to a search for “bad friends” or 
a radical group that demands and receives extreme loyalty’.169 These factors can increase an individual’s 
vulnerability to being recruited for the jihad.170 There are significant similarities between the methods 
described by Wessels and Dijkman and Buijs et al. and the loverboy approach, where a relationship and/
or a deep friendship or romance is formed and used to make vulnerable young people emotionally de-
pendent and to isolate them from their family and friends with the aim of creating a situation in which 
the victim can be exploited.171 However, further research is required to ascertain the extent to which the 
methods used to recruit for ISIS and for human trafficking are actually similar.

3.3.5 Is there exploitation of minors who are recruited?
Another question is whether recruiting minors for ISIS consti-
tutes exploitation within the meaning of the article on human 
trafficking.172 Under Article 237f (1)(2) DCC, it is a criminal of-
fence to recruit a person under the age of eighteen with the 
intention of exploiting that person. The question is whether 
the person who recruits someone for an armed conflict (which 
is a separate offence under Article 205 DCC) is also guilty of 
human trafficking in certain circumstances. That would be the 
case if the intention of the recruitment173 is also to exploit the 
other person. Particularly in the case of a person who has not 
yet left for Syria, that intention would be difficult to establish. 
Relevant factors in determining the intention of exploitation 
include the nature and duration of the work performed, the 
restrictions imposed on the victim by the work and the eco-
nomic benefit obtained by the recruiter.174 Also relevant is a 
recent ruling by the Supreme Court that the fact that the pos-

friendship and affection’ (Wessels and Dijkman, 2012: p. 102).
170 ‘It would be useful to examine the development of these girls and their specific need for love and respect. It is per-

haps no exaggeration to assert that the process of socialization is different for girls than for boys and that the shape 
of the relationship with their social environment perhaps has a greater influence. Consideration of the vulnerabil-
ity that can ensue from that might well be essential for reducing the personal and social risks, including the risk of 
becoming a victim of sexual and physical violence and being recruited for the “jihad” (Ibid: p. 102).

172 Inserted in Article 273f DCC. 
173 In addition to recruitment, it is also possible that the recruiter transports, accommodates or shelters the victim with 

the intention of exploiting him or her. According to the AIVD report, ‘minors receive help from ISIS members al-
ready in Syria or Iraq in planning their journey, usually without their parents’ knowledge.’(AIVD 2016, p. 7). How-
ever, the report does not say what his help comprises. It would be worthwhile investigating whether recruiters play 
a role in the transport, movement, accommodation or sheltering of minors, all of which are elements of the crime 
of human trafficking under Article 273(f ) DCC.

sible victim is a minor must also be taken into account in assessing those factors.175 If others are 
involved in the human trafficking – such as persons who, in contrast to the recruiter, are in Syria  – 
one option might be to prosecute them for a form of participation in human trafficking.

Although there is no reliable research,176 there are indications that Western youths probably are 
exploited by ISIS.177 There are reports, for example, that foreign fighters risk being killed if they refuse 
to fight with ISIS,178 that female recruits are sexually abused by male fighters,179 that foreign recruits are 
turned into domestic slaves,180 that women are forced to have children181 and that recruits’ passports are

drawn their passport184 and/or because they fear repressive measures will be taken against them on their 
return.185

As well as similarities, there are also differences. Whereas hu-
man traffickers approach vulnerable persons with the aim of ex-
ploiting them, there has been no evidence to date of recruiters 
for ISIS being influenced by financial motives. It seems that re-
cruiters act from ideological and/or religious motives when they 
persuade others to travel to Syria and/or Iraq. Nevertheless, it is 
not inconceivable that recruiters could profit personally from 
finding recruits for ISIS. Acquiring status186 and/or exploiting people for ISIS could also be motives. In 
the latter case, it would be important to prevent recruiters from tempting vulnerable young people with 
the intention of using them as an instrument for achieving their own ideals, namely an ‘Islamic State’. 
This might follow from the reports that foreign men and youths who arrive in Syria are sometimes 
forced to take part in the fighting.187 To gain a better picture of this, it would need to be shown what the 
motives of the persons who recruit for ISIS are. Only then can it be investigated whether and to what 
extent the motives and intentions of these recruiters are similar to those of human traffickers.

Vigilance
This initial study has identified possible risk factors for human trafficking with respect to children who 
travel or wish to travel to join ISIS. However, it remains difficult to produce distinct profiles of the degree 
of vulnerability. And although there are indications that recruiters for ISIS possibly use methods similar 
to those used by loverboys, neither that nor whether the recruiters can be regarded as human traffickers 
can be established with certainty. On the basis of this initial exploratory analysis from the perspective of 
human trafficking, young people who travel or wish to travel to join ISIS are assigned to the category 
‘Vigilance’.

The Ministers of Security and Justice and Social Affairs and Employment published the Comprehen-
sive Action Programme to Combat Jihadism188 on 29 August 2014. The programme includes five catego-
ries of measures: 1) risk reduction, 2) intervention, 3) tackling radicalization and social tensions, 4) so-
cial media and 5) information sharing and cooperation (both national and international). The 

184 Research by Van Grol et al. has shown that Dutch and Belgian fighters in Syria are aware that their passports could 
be revoked by the government (Grol et al. 2014). 

185 ‘A nuanced understanding of ISIS’s recruitment tactics, which may fit the international definition of human trafficking, affects how the inter-
national community must address this issue—including the strategies employed to combat recruitment, the content of the counterterrorism 
policy and research agenda, and how to rehabilitate girls who are, in fact, victims of human trafficking. Under the UN Trafficking Protocol, 
States have promised to protect women and girls from becoming victims of trafficking, punish traffickers, and rehabilitate survivors. Honoring 
this commitment, the international community should not vilify young women and girls as “terrorists” before running this critical assessment 
(Binetti, 2015: p. 8). An interesting initiative to adopt a different approach to returning jihadists is the method devel-
oped in Aarhus (Henley, 12 November 2014, ‘How do you Deradicalise Returning ISIS Fighters’, The Guardian, available at 
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/12/deradicalise-isis-fighters-jihadists-denmark-syria, consulted on 3 
March 2016). 

186 It follows from research by Feddes et al. that in some radical groups the members compete with each other as to who 
is the most devout ‘Muslim’ and for the accompanying status it gives. However, it is not clear from the study what 
the motives of recruiters for ISIS are (Feddes et al. 2015) 

187 ICSR, 2015. 
188 NCTV, 2014. 

‘The report [of ICSR] does not attempt to ex-
cuse, justify or glorify people’s decision to join 
IS. […] Their experiences, motivations and 
mindsets are diverse, and too little information 
is available to know whether they were perpe-
trators, victims – or indeed both’ [ISCR, 2015].

programme also provides for the withdrawal of Dutch citizenship from jihad travellers and the deten-
tion of any who might return.189

It might be possible to supplement this programme with an investigation into similarities between 
human trafficking and the recruitment of vulnerable young people for ISIS and whether, on the basis of 
the expertise gained in combating human trafficking, measures to combat jihadism can be improved, 

or vice versa. It might, for example be possible to use the experi-
ence gained in combating human trafficking at the international 
level in the last decade in formulating measures for dealing with 
individuals who recruit young people for ISIS. After all, there is 
no need to reinvent the wheel and create an entirely new infra-
structure to address the issue of the recruitment of jihadists when 
there is already a system in place in relation to human trafficking 
(to identify the nature and scale of the problem, to protect mi-
nors, to apprehend and prosecute offenders and to address the 
problem comprehensively). With the global recognition that hu-
man trafficking undermines our societies, for example, a highly 
repressive approach was initially chosen. The simplistic idea was 

that human trafficking would end if human traffickers were apprehended and it was made impossible 
for them to create victims. The strategy of protecting victims, pre-
venting human trafficking and an approach that balanced between 
caring for victims and punishing human traffickers only came later. 
Nowadays, the idea of a holistic approach to human trafficking is 
commonplace and increasingly appears to be bearing fruit.

The head of Europol190 has said that it is important not to treat 
every returning jihadist traveller immediately as a terrorist. 191 Bi-
netti seems to share that opinion and goes a step further, suggesting 
that whenever a girl returns it should be investigated whether she 
was the victim of exploitation.192 Although there is a need to remain 
vigilant, priority should always be given to determining the threat 
posed to society by returnees. The importance of doing so is further 
underlined in the study by CT Infobox,193 which stated that ‘the fu-
ture returning jihadist travellers could well include far more hard-
ened fighters who, on the instructions of groups in Syria or otherwise, undertake activities in the Neth-
erlands that could pose a threat to national security’.194

189 NCTV, 2014, particularly points 1 to 11. On the various strategies that countries could adopt , see also Barret, 2014.
190 Nevertheless, it must be investigated for every returning jihadist whether and, if so, to what extent he or she poses 

a threat to society, according to the head of Europol. See McDonald-Gibson, 5 March 2015, ‘Europol Head: Treat Ji-
hadi Runaways like Trafficking Victims’, Independent, available at http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/eu-

‘The Head of Europol, Robert Wainwright, 
drew a direct comparison between foreign fight-
ers and people who are trafficked over borders 
for sexual exploitation or labour. “The facilitat-
ed movement of foreign fighters to Syria and 
Iraq – aided by false promises and the coercion 
of victims upon arrival – carries similar charac-
teristics,” he said, urging governments to look at 
the policies which have helped battle traffick-
ing’ [Mcdonald-Gibson, The Indepent, 2015].

‘If some recruits fit international or national 
definitions of trafficked persons, it affects the 
way that the justice system categorizes their 
recruiters—who would be criminally liable for 
human trafficking—and also influences how 
the law interprets the actions of the trafficked 
young women when they sit as criminal defen-
dants. Furthermore, if women from the West 
joining ISIS are victims of human trafficking, 
this impacts how the international community 
should design its counter-terrorism policies and 
research agenda’ [Binetti, 2015].

Vulnerability up Close

If it is found that recruiters are recruiting minors with the intention of bringing them into a situation 
of exploitation, it might also be possible to arrest and prosecute them under the human trafficking ar-
ticle.195 A crucial element in that context remains the fact that the intention of exploitation has to be 
proved.196 If recruiters can be prosecuted as human traffickers, the next question is to what extent the 
doctrines relating to human trafficking would apply, including the non-punishment principle and the 
principle of non-consent. The former refers to the power of the PPS to waive prosecution of victims of 
human trafficking and of the court not to impose a sentence for offences that have been committed in 
a situation of exploitation. The rationale behind the principle is that the young person should be pro-
tected rather than punished because the offence was committed under duress.197 The non-consent prin-
ciple provides that the victim’s consent to human trafficking is irrelevant when it can be shown that all 
of the criteria for human trafficking are met.198

Another aspect that needs to be considered is whether, and if so how, specialized help that has been 
developed for victims of human trafficking199 could also be effectively used (perhaps in a different form) 
for young people who wish to travel to Syria and/or Iraq or have 
returned from there. The programmes designed to help with the 
deradicalization of young people and to remove the structural 
factors that make some young people vulnerable to radicaliza-
tion are similar to the programmes for treating underage victims 
of human trafficking who have been exploited by means of the 
loverboy method.200

Finally, a lot has been learned over the years from the experi-
ences of victims of human trafficking. The information they have 
shared has made a valuable contribution to improving measures 
to combat and investigate human trafficking. Their stories are 
also used to inform young people of the potential risks. After all, 
no one can describe the dangers of human trafficking better than 
those who have experienced it. The same seems to apply for young people who have possibly been 
misled and/or manipulated into travelling to join the jihad and later return disillusioned.201 Their testi-
mony could also play an important role in preventing the radicalization and recruitment of other young 

195 Article 273f DCC.
196 Binetti also describes this as a difficult element (Binetti, 2015). 
197 On this point, Binetti says: ‘If a girl is lured under false pretences and is exploited by ISIS, States should consider whether it is sound 

policy to label her a “terrorist,” when she would be considered a victim of human trafficking under the international definition’ (Binetti, 
2015: p. 6). 

198 ‘The Trafficking in Persons Protocol states that the consent of the victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation is irrelevant 
when any of the “means” set forth in it are used’ (UNODC, 2014: p. 6). See also Article 3 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (New York, 15 November 2000), Bulletin of Treaties 2001, 69 and 2004, 35.

collaborates with the NCTV, through the ‘Exits’ facility and the Family Support Centre for Radicalization which are 
part of the Stichting Fier Fryslân. See Parliamentary Documents II 2015/16, 29754, no. 326. 

201 ‘Despite the fact that the Netherlands has been confronted for more than three years with the phenomenon of foreign fighters in Syria, we 
still have little insight into the backgrounds and motivations of these persons. Most knowledge available on this subject comes from 
journalistic work. Scientific studies into the characteristics and biographies of these foreign fighters are scarce. Also, they are based on only 
a small number of cases’ (Bakker and Grol, 2015). 

‘Returning fighters themselves could play a sig-
nificant role in helping the State or their com-
munity to understand these issues and so miti-
gate the threat, and this also argues for careful 
treatment of each returnee on a case-by-case 
basis. A returning fighter will have a great deal 
of credibility in radical circles at home, and if he 
argues against participation in the war, and 
against the al-Qaeda narrative more generally, 
this is likely to be more effective than anything 
a government can do’ [Barret, 2014].

202 ‘The importance of a story or counter-story (“narratives”) that counterbalances propagandist messages that offer a utopian, “romantic”

4  Children who are exploited within families 
(familial exploitation)

Roma children

The European Commission has classified Roma children as a group that 
is particularly vulnerable to human trafficking because of their familial 
and socioeconomic circumstances. In recent years there have been convic-
tions in the Netherlands of adults who have induced children in their 
family to commit crimes (criminal exploitation). Nevertheless, the con-
nection with human trafficking does not always seem to be made in this 
type of case, creating the risk that these children do not receive ade-
quate protection. Moreover, the authorities sometimes wrongly fail to consider question of whether the 
non-punishment principle should apply. Besides criminal exploitation, there is also a relationship be-
tween arranged child marriages and human trafficking. This is a link that demands closer attention, not 
only because child marriages are undesirable in themselves, but also because they can increase the 
child’s vulnerability to exploitation and sexual violence. On the basis of this study, this group has been 
assigned to the category ‘Concrete actions’.

Children living illegally in the Netherlands who  
are exploited within the family

Children who have to work within a family are vulnerable because of 
the private context in which the work is performed and the relationship 
of dependence that automatically exists between adults and a child. 
This vulnerability is magnified if the child is living illegally in the Neth-
erlands and is not familiar with the Dutch language and culture. A num-
ber of persons have been convicted in recent years for forcing children 
to work for their family, often for years. To tackle this form of human trafficking, it is important for 
measures to be taken to ensure that it is identified. When it comes to children living illegally in the 
Netherlands who do not go to school, it is crucial for the general public to know about human traffick-
ing and for medical professionals to increase their expertise in the subject. On the basis of this analysis, 
these children are assigned to the category ‘Concrete actions’.

4.1 Roma children

4.1.1 Roma in the Netherlands and policy
For the last 40 years the Dutch government has devoted attention to the Roma communities1 from a vari-
ety of perspectives and with varying levels of intensity. One of the questions that has been addressed is how 
to promote the integration (‘inclusion’) of the Roma in Dutch society, for example by preventing children 
from staying away from school and increasing the labour participa-
tion rate among this group.2 That perspective was based mainly on 
the history of the Roma as a group that has been discriminated 
against and permanently marginalized.3 More recently, policymak-
ers have adopted a more repressive perspective,4 with the focus not 
only on the inclusion of Roma communities, but also on the en-
forcement of Dutch law, including the punishment of crimes re-
portedly committed by these communities.5 Both perspectives are 
clearly recognizable in the communication by the Dutch government on policies towards the Roma in the 
last decade,6 which has repeatedly referred to ‘setting boundaries and offering perspective.7

From both perspectives, there is growing attention to the situation of children in Roma communi-
ties. This is evident, for example, from the establishment of the Programme to Combat the Exploitation 
of Roma Children, a joint programme established by a number of ‘pilot municipalities’.8 The aim of the

People in Need, where the following is noted: ‘Certainly trafficking exists and its impact on Roma is grave. But it does 
not explain the migration of Roma, which is due largely to structural poverty, marginalisation and discrimination’ 
(ERRC, 2011: p. 1).

pression (Sollie et al. 2013: p. 72). 

5 Rodrigues and Van Baar refer to a ‘repressive target group policy’ and are critical of it. According to them, such a 
policy leads to stigmatization and fails to reflect the varied backgrounds of Roma families in the Netherlands (Rod-
rigues and Van Baar, 23 July 2015, ‘Discriminatie: fraudebestendige meter in Roma-wijk’ [Discrimination: fraud-
proof meter in Roma district], NRC Handelsblad). See also Van Baar, 26 October 2013, ‘Roma worden weer zigeunerbo-
even’ [Roma are once again gipsy thieves], Trouw. Van Baar observes that there is ‘[…] excessive attention to law 
enforcement and crime fighting’. See also Davidović and Rodrigues, 2010. 

6 For a recent example of this, see the letter to the House of Representatives from the Ministers of Security and Justice 
and Social Affairs and Employment on the current state of affairs regarding the Programme to Combat the Exploita-
tion of Roma Children, in which the ministers wrote that an ‘[…] important principle of the programme is that of-
fering a perspective for children and enforcing the law should have equal weight. Enforcement is essential for ulti-
mately being able to offer a perspective for the child.’ Letter from the Ministers of Security and Justice and Social 
Affairs and Employment of 14 April 2015 on the current state of affairs regarding the Programme to Combat the Ex-
ploitation of Roma Children.

7 For this terminology, see Parliamentary Documents II 2008/09, 31 700 XVIII, no. 90, p. 3. In this so-called ‘Roma letter’ 
the minister explains the guiding principles of his joint approach with the ‘Roma municipalities’. In addition to the 
primary decentralized approach, the basic generic policy and the involvement of the Roma community, a fourth 
principle is ‘setting boundaries and offering perspective’. ‘In other words, equal rights and duties, law enforcement, 
but at the same time offering help’. 

8 For the most recent letter on the status of the programme, see the aforementioned letter from the Ministers of Se-
curity and Justice and Social Affairs and Employment of 14 April 2015 on the current state of affairs regarding the 
Programme to Combat the Exploitation of Roma Children. 

‘It is evident that Roma children are often per-
ceived as units of malleable and easily control-
lable labour due to their parents’ low economic 
status, which places them in vulnerable situa-
tions conducive to labour exploitation’ [Ahrin, 
2012].

programme is to allow the participating municipalities to formulate policies on this issue and to share 
their experiences with the implementation of those policies. It is also the intention that by sharing their 
experiences they will encourage more municipalities and agencies to take action of their own. Policies 
relating to Roma children are also being formulated at the EU level. For example, the European Com-
mission regards Roma children as particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and specifically includes 
‘awareness-raising activities’ in relation to the subject in the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of 
Trafficking in Human Beings.9 Reports have also appeared in Europe in the last few years in which special 
attention has been devoted to the vulnerability of Roma children to becoming victims of human traf-
ficking.10 That vulnerability is the focus of this report. 

It cannot be stressed often enough that the problems discussed here do not apply for every Roma 
family. Furthermore, this chapter has been written in the full realization that the Roma community is 
highly diverse and comprises numerous sub-groups.11 It is therefore difficult to talk about ‘the Roma’, 
as though it were a single community with the same customs and culture. It is also important to stress 
that the exploitation of children within the family is not confined to Roma communities. Section 4.2 
provides one example of that, but there are other vulnerable groups that could also be mentioned. For 
example, there are signs that human trafficking also occurs in other groups (nomadic or otherwise), 
such as Irish Travellers.12

At both the national and European level, the attention to Roma children extends to a number of 
connected themes, and the problems can only be properly understood by considering all of the themes 
together.13 Because such a comprehensive exercise is beyond the scope of this study, this chapter is 
confined to a discussion of the position of Roma children in Dutch society, including their vulnerability 
to human trafficking. The focus then shifts to specific cases and signals that the National Rapporteur has 
received about subjects related to human trafficking, specifically:

1) The criminal exploitation of children, for example by inducing them to engage in shoplifting; and
2) The arranged marriages of Roma children (arranged child marriages).

Both phenomena – criminal exploitation and arranged child marriages  – occur in the Netherlands, 
prevent children from enjoying free and independent personal development and violate fundamental 
children’s rights, including the right to education and physical and mental integrity (and thus also sex-
ual integrity).

4.1.2.1 Background and vulnerability of the Roma community in the Netherlands

Vulnerability up Close

revealed a number of factors that appear to make some members of the Roma community vulnerable 
in Dutch society. For example, research by Movisie has shown that poverty is relatively common among 
Roma families in the Netherlands.16 The explanation given for this is that it is less common for members 
of this group to have a regular job and that many are reluctant to accept salaried employment. Dis-
crimination against the Roma in the labour market is also a factor and the Roma say that their back-
ground is a major obstacle to finding regular work.17 Crime – particularly shoplifting, deception and 
illegal trade – appears to occur more frequently in some families.18 Poverty can also create pressure on 
women and children to contribute to the family’s income, which increases the chance that they will be 
exploited.19 The participation in education by the Roma is also a source of concern in the Netherlands. 
Research by the Trimbos Institute20 shows that many children from Roma families have language and 
development deficits, which are reflected in poorer grades in school. It is therefore argued that Roma 
children in primary school, and possibly also in secondary school, appear to be less resilient and ‘suffer 
more from feelings of insecurity, anxiety, low self-confidence and low self-esteem’.21 Other research 
shows that a relatively large number of young Roma drop out of secondary school, because boys see no 
perspective in the labour market and girls are preparing for their role as housewives.22 The school drop-
out rate among girls is possibly also connected with the high number of teenage pregnancies in this 
group.23 The number of early school leavers is possibly also a factor in the inability of many Roma fami-
lies to break out of the situation of relative poverty in which they find themselves.24

4.1.2.2 Human trafficking and related phenomena in Roma families in the Netherlands
The discussion above shows that Roma children could be vulnerable in a number of respects. In the last 
few years it has been found that these children are also victims of human trafficking, specifically of hu-
man trafficking for the purposes of criminal exploitation, whereby children are induced to commit 
crimes. Furthermore, there are also arranged marriages of children in some Roma families. Both phe-
nomena are discussed below.

16 Movisie, 2013: p. 31. A similar impression emerges in Sollie et al. 2013. 
17 Stateless Roma are usually not allowed to work because they do not have a residence permit. Their statelessness also 

often means that they are not entitled to social services, which makes their situation even more difficult (Doctors of 
the World, 2009: § 4.3).

people that complete their secondary schooling, but this is often only to the level of preparatory vocational educa-
tion, which means they still have no basic qualifications (Trimbos Institute, 2012: p. 7)

4.1.3 Criminal exploitation

4.1.3.1 Criminal exploitation is a form of human trafficking
Inducing children to commit criminal offences is a form of human trafficking.25 Exploitation where the 
victim is induced to commit a crime is known as criminal exploitation.26 Because they are children, there 
is no requirement that coercion was used.27 The fact that a child might have consented to the exploita-
tion is also irrelevant.28

To date, there have been two convictions for the exploitation of minors in a Roma community in the 
Netherlands.29 In one of these, in 2014, The Hague District Court convicted an uncle who had induced 
his nephews to commit a burglary.30

Uncle induces nephews to commit a burglary
In this case, a 49-year-old man living in the Netherlands brought two underage nephews to Was-
senaar to break into a house there. All three were arrested for theft. A month later the nephews, 
who did not speak Dutch, received unconditional prison sentences of six weeks. The uncle was 
tried months later, because the case was only later seen in the context of human trafficking. He 
was eventually convicted not only of being an accessory to the theft, but also of exploiting his 
nephews (human trafficking). In the opinion of the court, he had abused the position of author-
ity he had over his nephews as their uncle. The uncle was given an unconditional prison sentence 
of twelve months.31 After serving their sentences, the nephews disappeared.

Apart from these two convictions, little is known about the exploitation of children in Roma communi-
ties. In the report of a study by the Police Academy,32 the authors draw attention to the issue, but say 
nothing about the scale on which this form of exploitation occurs. A recent study by De Witte and Pehli-
van provides more insight into the prevalence of petty crime committed by children of Central and 
South-East European origin, but it is not clear from the report whether the children were actually mem-
bers of the Roma community or whether they had been instructed to commit crimes in the registered 

25 Human trafficking is a criminal offence by virtue of Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC). Since 15 November 
2013, ‘exploitation of criminal activities’ has been a specific form of exploitation under Article 273f (2) DCC. 

26 For a detailed discussion of this, see National Rapporteur, 2013: pp. 120 ff. 
27 This needs to be qualified. Evidence of coercion is required if the prosecution is based on Article 273f (1)(4) DCC. At 

the same time, there is a presumption that cases in which a child is induced to commit theft by definition involve 
the means of coercion ‘abuse of a position of vulnerability’ or ‘misuse of authority arising from the actual state of 
affairs’, in view of the exceptional vulnerability of children and their dependence on parents/adults. This seems to 
have been the reasoning in Gelderland District Court 21 December 2015, ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2015:8040, for example, in 
which the court found that the children in the case ‘[…] given the relevant circumstances of the case were in a vulner-
able and dependent position in relation to the suspect due to the fact that the suspect and [name] are their parents, 
and because of their young age (nine and seven years of age at the time)’. 

28 The same also applies for adults. See also Article 2(5) of the EU Human Trafficking Directive, which states that the 
consent of a victim to the intended or actual exploitation is irrelevant if the use of any means of coercion is proved. 
In the case of minors, the use of coercion does not usually have to be proved. See the previous footnote.

cases, and hence whether there was clearly an element of human trafficking.33 The study describes how 
between 2010 and 2013 the police in Rotterdam registered twenty cases of petty crime committed by 
children from Central and Eastern Europe where there was a suspicion that the children had acted on 
the directions of adults. The Youth Care Agency in Rotterdam reports that the number ‘is rising every 
year’ and that there are also ‘several cases every month’. In the Amsterdam region, a total of 241 cases 
involving petty crimes committed by children from Central and South-East Europe who had reached the 
age of criminal responsibility were registered between 2009 and 2014.34 However, it is not known wheth-
er any adults were involved in those situations.

4.1.3.2 Identifying criminal exploitation
There are a number of reasons for the lack of information about the nature and scale of the exploitation of 
Roma children. In the first place, the registration of ethnic origin is not permitted.35 A further problem is 
that agencies do not always immediately look at a situation from a human trafficking perspective.36

The Council of Europe has called for further research to learn more about the exploitation of Roma 
children in the Netherlands, concluding ‘that the question of human trafficking for the purpose of 
forced begging or petty crimes which affects predominantly chil-
dren, particularly of Roma origin, deserves further research in the 
Netherlands as this phenomenon has been witnessed in neigh-
bouring countries where transnational networks have been oper-
ating and moving children from one country to another’.37 The 
admonition by the Council of Europe reflects the fact that Roma 
children are increasingly often regarded as a group that is particu-
larly vulnerable to human trafficking.38 On behalf of the Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) 
of the Ministry of Security and Justice, the University of Utrecht is currently researching a comprehensive 
programme to combat the criminal exploitation of children. The research also extends to the identifica-
tion of exploitation by first-line professionals. The results of the study are expected in the second half 
of 2016.39

4.1.4 Arranged child marriages and the link with human trafficking
A particular issue that is often not seen in terms of exploitation and human trafficking is that of mar-
riages of Roma children.40 These marriages are generally informal affairs that are not concluded under 
Dutch law.41 Although child marriages42 do not occur in every Roma family, and individual families may 
have very different opinions about this type of marriage, marriages of Roma children do seem to occur 
in the Netherlands.43 However, there are no quantitative data on which to base any judgments about the 
scale of the problem. In their report, Sollie et al. argue that child marriages are ‘very common’ within 
the Roma community, but it is not clear what they base that conclusion on.44 A noteworthy finding in a 
recent report by Rutten et al. is the absence of consensus among the respondents regarding the age at 
which children in the Roma community marry; one respondent said it was between the ages of twelve 
and sixteen, another observed that the age was rising from between thirteen and fourteen to between 
sixteen and seventeen, and yet another respondent felt that the age is well above eighteen.45

Although there has been little research into the form taken by child marriages within Roma communi-
ties in the Netherlands, a constant factor in what descriptions there are is the relative absence of control 
by the bride and groom over their own wedding.46 In contrast to a marriage between two partners who 
have consciously chosen one another, these marriages represent more the creation of a relationship 
between the relevant families, and more specifically the girl’s parents and her future in-laws.47 In other 
words, those instances where the parents organize their children’s marriage are arranged (informal) child 
marriages. These marriages are not unproblematic. They are now regarded worldwide as institutions 
that impair the free development of children. At the national level, the concerns about arranged mar-
riages also seem to have been a primary motivator behind the adoption of additional policies to prevent 
forced marriages. Although at first glance arranged marriages and forced marriages seem to be distinct 
phenomena, a lot of attention has been devoted to the overlap between them in both the literature and 
policies.48

40 Sollie et al. 2013: p. 46, Veneman, 2014: p. 15 f.f. 
41 According to Rutten et al., informal marriages are ‘marriages that are performed in a manner that differs from the 

form prescribed by the laws of the country in which the marriage is concluded’ (Rutten et al. 2015: p. 4, 23 and 25). 
42 Following the line taken by Rutten et al., informal marriages are defined as ‘marriages in which at the time of the 

conclusion of the marriage at least one of the marriage candidates has not yet reached the age of eighteen’ (Rutten 
et al. 2015: p. 24 and 47) 

43 Sollie et al. 2013: p. 79. See also Veneman, 2014 and Rutten et al. 2015. 
44 Sollie et al. 2013: p. 79. A study by the Trimbos Institute into truancy from school among Roma girls found that many 

of the municipalities surveyed recognized the problem of girls marrying at a young age (Trimbos Institute 2012, p. 
20 ff.). Several respondents in the study by Rutten et al. said that child marriages in the Roma community are ‘com-
mon’. The researchers note that the respondents link that impression to the value that is attached to marrying at a 
young age. Another respondent said that he did not encounter Roma child marriages and had only observed mar-
riages of persons over the age of eighteen. Three respondents were mentioned in the study. 

45 Rutten et al. 2015: p. 64. 
46 In the same vein, see Veneman, 2014, who raises the question of whether arranged marriages involving minors are 

not, by definition, forced marriages. 
47 Sollie et al. 2013, p. 46, who conclude in a recently published study that among Roma and Sinti a marriage is re-

garded ‘[…] as a contract, which is concluded between families that make agreements with each other on subjects 
such as the price of the bride and where the couple will live’. The respondents in that study described the Roma and 
Sinti marriage as ‘a commercial agreement between two families with respect to the marriage partners’ (Rutten et 
al. 2015: p. 80 and 143).

48 This overlap is discussed at more length in § 4.1.4.1.



76
Vulnerability up Close

In the following section, the relationship between arranged child marriages and human trafficking 
and sexual violence against children is explored further. The discussion covers three subjects: 1) the re-
lationship between this type of marriage and human trafficking and coercion, 2) the relationship be-
tween this type of marriage and criminal exploitation, and 3) the relationship between the consumma-
tion of an arranged child marriage and human trafficking and sexual violence against children. All three 
subjects are discussed from the perspective of the substantive criminal law. The section explores the 
extent to which the phenomenon of arranged child marriages touches on the offences defined by the 
Dutch Criminal Code in relation to human trafficking and sexual violence against children. The inherent 
constraints of this approach are discussed in § 4.1.4.5.

4.1.4.1 The relationship between arranged child marriages, human trafficking and coercion
The question that can be asked is whether arranging a child marriage is in itself a form of human traffick-
ing. For that to be the case, under Article 273f (1)(2) DCC at least, there has to be an intention – on the part 
of the parents – to exploit the child by arranging the marriage. It might, for example, be possible to infer 
the existence of that intention from the fact that a girl’s parents receive a bride price for the ‘transfer’ of the 
girl. However, it is questionable whether the actual intention in this case is to exploit the girl. Although 
making the association with human trafficking is certainly not far-fetched, arranging the marriage does 
not in itself seem to go to the core of the definition of the offence of human trafficking in Article 273f (1)(2) 
DCC, where the ‘element of profiting’ is often more clearly prominent.49

That is not to say that arranged child marriages are unproblematic from a criminal law perspective. 
The question is whether in the case of arranged child marriages – where, by definition, parents are in a 
position of authority over children50 – there is not also a form of coercion that is relevant for the pur-
poses of criminal law. The overlap between arranged marriages and forced marriages is discussed in vari-
ous sources in the literature. The general consensus seems to be that arranged marriages are not neces-
sarily forced marriages, which only arise if the arranged marriage can be regarded as involuntary. The 
answer to the question of when an arranged marriage becomes a forced marriage therefore depends on 
whether one can can speak of the absence of consent, in other words whether force was used. The use of 
force to unlawfully compel a person to act or to refrain from certain acts or to tolerate certain acts either 
directed against that person or any other person is a criminal offence under Article 284 DCC.51 The offence 
is based on a broad definition of force. The provision covers a variety of types of force, including ‘other 
acts’, which might include the aforementioned abuse of a position of authority for example, but also 
perhaps the perceived pressure the children feel to comply with socio-cultural expectations.52 This type 
of ‘social pressure’ is not easy to prove.53 As the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations states in 
the ’Action Plan on Preventing Forced Marriage’, it is frequently ‘[…] difficult to establish when an advi-
sory and supportive parental role becomes social pressure or even criminal duress’,54 and ‘there can be 

49 This appeared to be the situation in a case in the Netherlands that was described in the study by the European Roma 
Rights Centre mentioned earlier (See ERCC, 2011: p. 73). On the key to the definition of the offence of human traf-
ficking, see also Esser and Dettmeijer-Vermeulen, 2014.

forms of social pressure, which young people do not resist out of loyalty to the parents and family, or that 
are internalized to such an extent that curtailment of freedom of choice is not experienced as such.’55

There have been no instances to date where parents have been prosecuted for their role in the forced 
marriage of a child, although there has been growing pressure to do so from international organizations 
and in national policy in recent years. In this context, it is relevant that the maximum sentence for of-
fences under Article 284 DCC was raised in 2013, precisely with a view to taking more effective action 
against forced marriage.56 There have also been calls at the international level for measures to address 
forced marriage. The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against 
Women and Domestic Violence,57 which was recently ratified by the Netherlands, specifically refers to 
measures under criminal law; countries are obliged to make forced marriage a criminal offence, and in 
the preamble to the Convention forced marriage is described as ‘a serious violation of the human rights 
of women and girls and a major obstacle to the achievement of equality between women and men’.58 
Even before the Convention’s ratification, there was a discussion in the Netherlands about the need to 
strengthen the sanctions for forced marriage under criminal law. The Minister of Security and Justice, for 
example, felt that it was essential to address forced marriage with criminal law.59 Although he did not feel 
it was the only instrument, he said that criminal law, although an ultimum remedium, is an ‘essential cor-
nerstone’ of efforts to combat forced marriage. He went on to say:

‘When severe psychological pressure or even physical pressure is exerted, with the result that a 
person feels compelled to enter into a marriage, a line is crossed − also from the perspective of 
criminal law. The impact and consequences of a forced marriage are considerable and intense. 
Victims must be protected against that. The protection that the government can provide includes 
protection under criminal law.’60

law. According to him, alternative measures ‘[…] do not affect the fact that the criminal law must be adequately 
equipped to allow effective action to be taken in relevant cases of forced marriage’. And ‘It is, after all, necessary to 
keep criminal law up to date. The legislature must remain alert to new social, cultural, economic and technological 
developments and where necessary amend legislation having due regard to society’s prevailing convictions about 
the law. The amendments proposed in this bill must be seen as an essential cornerstone of the entire set of measures 
designed to remove statutory lacunas in the criminal law and so ensure that relevant cases can be properly investi-
gated, prosecuted and punished. The proposed changes can also be expected to send a signal, so the instruments of 
criminal law intended to combat forced marriage will also have a certain preventive and deterrent effect’ (Parliamen-
tary Documents I 2012/13, 32 830, C, p. 1-2).

Vulnerability up Close

It is also interesting to note that with the implementation of the Convention, a new criminal offence 
was create with the insertion of Article 285c in the Dutch Criminal Code. That provision makes it a 
criminal offence for a person to intentionally lure another person out of or into the Netherlands with 
the intention of committing any of the offences set out in Article 284 with respect to that person. As 
applied to forced marriage, this provision covers the situation where person A entices person B from one 
country to another in order to force person B to enter into a marriage in that other country. For the com-
mission of this offence there is no requirement for the marriage actually to be concluded. According to 
the legislature, the element of ‘luring’ for the purposes of Article 285c DCC exists ‘when the person is 
induced to travel to another country under false pretences’.61 Luring also includes ‘any act that can rea-
sonably be deemed capable of persuading a person to travel to another country, while that person would 
not have travelled to the other country if that act had not been performed or if the person had known 
what the actual purpose of the journey was.’62 The fact that the victim is in a position of dependence in 
relation to the perpetrator and is consequently highly impressionable could, according to the legisla-
ture, be a factor in determining whether the acts by which the victim was lured could reasonably have 
served that purpose.63

4.1.4.2 The relationship between arranged child marriages and criminal exploitation
The National Rapporteur has received signals from the professional field that girls who enter arranged 
marriages are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.64 Their increased vulnerability lies in the fact 
that some Roma girls, before they marry, are forced to steal in order to prove their ‘worth’ to their future 
parents-in-law.65 There are also indications that these girls, once married, have to continue stealing or 
are forced to beg 66 in order to repay the bride price.67 A case provided by the police in the East Nether-
lands region illustrates the problem.

‘I am now fifteen years of age and have been married for a year. I did not know the young man I 
married before the wedding. When I was around eight years old, my father told me I would have 
to marry. He told me that I had been ‘promised’ and that, when I was old enough, I would move 
to another family. I did not protest. I was still too young and had seen the same thing happening 
with girls I knew. I now live with my parents-in-law, my husband, his older sister and two young-
er brothers. A few times a week I go […] with my father-in-law or an uncle or cousin in the car to 
a shopping centre. I don’t know in advance where we are going, but it is usually to a different city

each time. We have to ‘earn money’ there. Sometimes we steal, usually articles for the house-
hold. Other times we follow an old woman and discover her PIN code.’

4.1.4.3  The consummation of an arranged child marriage and the relationship with human 
trafficking and other offences

In addition to the marriage itself and the criminal exploitation that might precede it, reports from op-
erational practice and in the literature refer to a ritual in which children are expected to have intercourse 
on the wedding night, primarily to demonstrate the girl’s virginity.69 Sometimes, a bloody sheet is dis-
played during the marriage ceremony to show that the girl really is a virgin.70 In Belgium, two sets of 
parents were convicted of involvement in an arranged marriage and its consummation.

Conviction in Belgium for involvement in the consummation of a marriage
The case occurred in Verviers in Belgium, where two Roma couples were sentenced to five 
years in prison for human trafficking, rape and indecent assault. The parents of two minors had 
arranged a marriage between them and created a setting for the consummation of the mar-
riage. The sum of money that the girls’ parents would receive was made dependent on wheth-
er the girl was still a virgin. In its judgment the court found that sexual acts had actually taken 
place between the minors. The court’s principal criticism of both sets of parents was that they 
had set up a ritual that promoted the consummation of the marriage by the children con-
cerned.71

Parents of minors who encourage their children to consummate the marriage – whether or not as part 
of a ceremony – are also possibly guilty of one or more offences against public morals in the Nether-
lands. If both children are minors, then both the boy and the girl are victims. The principal relevant 
offence in this case is human trafficking, more specifically the form of human trafficking covered by 
Article 273f (1)(5) DCC,72 but it also appears to involve a number of offences against public morals. For 
example, under Articles 247, 248f and 250 DCC it is a criminal offence to induce a person to perform 
indecent acts with a third party. The offence under Article 248f DCC is that of intentionally inducing a 
minor to engage in indecent acts with a third party with the use of coercion. The maximum sentence for 
this offence, which only entered into force in 2014, is ten years’ imprisonment and applies in relation 
to minors up to the age of eighteen. It is only a punishable if the minor is coerced in some way to have 
sex with a third party (in this case, the person the child is marrying). In these cases the coercion could 
lie in the situation of dependence between those arranging the marriage and those for whom the mar-
riage is arranged, a situation that here too might fall under the element ‘other act’. The indecent nature 
of the sexual contact that must exist could be formed by the context in which the sexual acts take place: 
minors engaging in sex in a setting arranged by adult third parties. Coercion is not an element of the

72 Under Article 273f (1)(5) DCC, any person who induces another person to make him/herself available for performing 

sexual acts with or for a third party for remuneration is committing a criminal offence. The element of ‘remunera-
tion’ could raise problems in this context, since in the ceremony described here the sexual acts are primarily in-
tended to demonstrate the girl’s virginity. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the girls’ parents  – who are after all 
receiving a sum of money, the size of which depends in part on their daughter being a virgin  – enjoy financial 
benefit from the consummation of the marriage.

offence in the case of procurement, which carries a lighter maximum prison sentence. Article 250 DCC 
explicitly covers inducing or encouraging one’s own child to perform sexual acts with a with a third 
person. This aim of this article therefore seems to correspond most closely with the situation in which 
parents encourage their own child to have sex with a partner they have chosen. Finally, if the children 
are younger than sixteen, there is also criminal liability by virtue of Article 247 DCC, which makes it a 
criminal offence for a person to induce a child under the age of sixteen to perform or submit to sexual 
acts with a third party. The maximum sentence is six years in prison.73

4.1.4.5 Giving priority to arranged child marriages in the policy on criminal procedure
The preceding sections have reviewed the relationship between arranged child marriages in Roma com-
munities and human trafficking and other offences against public morals in the Dutch Criminal Code. 
The subject has been discussed mainly from the perspective of criminal law. It is important, however, to 
guard against expecting too much from that approach. Criminal law is not always the answer. Complex 
phenomena such as arranged child marriages, and associated phenomena, cannot be understood, pre-
vented and combated solely from a criminal-law perspective; they also have to be addressed with alter-
native instruments that could achieve the desired objectives. At the same time, forced marriage, crimi-
nal exploitation and inducing the consummation of a marriage are all actions that violate the 
fundamental rights of children: they affect core values such as personal autonomy and sexual integrity 
and it is not for nothing that in recent years efforts have been made at both the national and interna-
tional level to strengthen the instruments of criminal law designed to punish those acts. It therefore 
seems appropriate to address the problems described here more from a criminal-law perspective in the 
years to come. Naturally, this approach cannot be based solely on legislation, or more specifically on the 
recent legislation relating to forced marriage. Compliance with the law depends on its enforcement. It 
is therefore important that arranged child marriages in the Roma community and the relationship with 
human trafficking and sexual violence against children should also receive more attention in law en-
forcement policy. The National Rapporteur has on several occasions referred in this context to the rela-
tive lack of experience with investigation and prosecution in relation to arranged child marriages and 
the related problems. These issues still need to receive greater priority from the police and the PPS. Only 
if the government treats the relationship between arranged marriages and human trafficking and sexu-
al violence against children as a priority can it make a genuine contribution to preventing and combat-
ing it through criminal law.

73 For a detailed discussion of the various acts that are criminalized in the section of the Dutch Criminal Code on of-
fences against public morals, see Van Dijk, 2015.

Figure X. This figure shows the relationship between the problems described above and offences in the Dutch Criminal Code. 
Before the marriage there might be criminal exploitation (Article 273f DCC) of the girl in order to demonstrate her ‘worth’ 
to her new in-laws. The arranged marriage is itself perhaps a form of human trafficking, but it is more logical to consider it 
from the perspective of the use of force (a forced marriage, Article 284 DCC). In that context, there can also be conduct that 
has recently been criminalized under Article 285c DCC. Once the marriage has taken place, there are two possible conse-
quences that could be linked to both human trafficking and a number of offences against public morals. They are the in-
duced consummation of the marriage (for example, on the wedding night) and criminal exploitation, where the girl has to 
‘earn back’ the bride price paid by her parents-in-law to her parents.

4.1.5 Nomadic Roma communities
It has become clear in recent years that these problems are not confined to Roma families that live per-
manently in the Netherlands. Both phenomena described here also occur in Roma communities living 
temporarily in the Netherlands, the mobile or nomadic groups. Children in one of these mobile groups 
are members of a community that often include adult family members who are not necessarily the 
children’s parents. The organization of the group is characterized by its mobile nature and, with the 
enlargement of the European Union and the Schengen Zone, it is able to move easily between coun-
tries.74 When these groups have come to the attention of the authorities too often, they move to an-
other EU country.

Some of these groups seem to operate as criminal networks. Research by Siegel75 shows that the 
groups (or clans) target poor, vulnerable Roma in their own country and recruit them with the promise

that they can earn money quickly in Western Europe. They are then used by the network for pick-pock-
eting, begging, money changing tricks, deception and fraud and have to surrender most of the money 
they earn to the clan. Girls from unstable or unsafe families are made dependent using the loverboy 
method and forced into prostitution by the human trafficker.76

Tackling these phenomena is all the more difficult in this ‘mobile’ context because it is frequently 
difficult to establish a person’s identity.77 It is also difficult for government agencies to establish the 
relationship between a child and an adult. There have been occasions when children who had been ar-
rested were allowed to leave with people who had not been incontrovertibly identified as their rela-
tives.78 It is also more difficult to monitor children who are members of a nomadic groups because of 
their movement from place to place.

4.1.6 Problems (in the chain)
Roma children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and should be recognized and treated as such 
by Dutch government agencies. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Five problems are discussed 
in that context.

4.1.6.1 The protection of Roma children in arranged marriages
The first problem relates to arranged marriages. Children who have to marry at a young age are vulner-
able to human trafficking. As already mentioned, girls in particular are induced to commit crimes in 
order to demonstrate that they can be a source of income, with which the bride price can also be re-
couped later. The arranged marriage itself could possibly be seen as a form of human trafficking, and as 
has been shown the consummation of the marriage could be regarded as constituting human trafficking 
and sexual violence against children.

The National Rapporteur has received warnings from professionals that it is very difficult to prevent 
children from being married off. The problems begin with the identification of situations where it oc-
curs. Although the impending marriage of children from Roma families living permanently in the Neth-
erlands could be recognized early on, it does not always happen. For example, a girl who is being sent 
out to steal will generally no longer be going to school so there is no way of identifying her in the educa-
tion system (by teachers in particular). Research by Myria also shows that very few forced marriages are 
reported.79 In the first place this is due to the fact that the marriages are conducted privately and the 
authorities therefore know little about them. Secondly, few victims report their situation to the govern-
ment, usually because of feelings of shame or fear or out of loyalty to their family or community.

Identification is primarily the responsibility of municipalities, partners in the local health-care chain 
and the police. It is important for the authorities at this level to invest in measures aimed at the early 
recognition of forced marriages, and it is equally important for the national government to support them 
in that endeavour. Generally speaking, municipalities should consult the Dutch Centre of Forced Mar-
riage and Abandonment, which can advise them on the most approriate approach in each individual 
situation. This mechanism should always be used if there are indications that children are being forced 
to marry. A further recommendation is that other municipalities should join the initiatives that have al-

ready been taken by the pilot municipalities in the Programme to Combat the Exploitation of Roma 
Children.80 There is no blueprint for the most suitable approach, although one step that could be taken 
in every case is to enforce the Compulsory Schooling Act if children remain absent from school. It is also 
important to provide counselling for children who are forced to marry and the families they are living 
with. The degree of compulsion with which the relevant marriage was entered into should also be inves-
tigated. In 2013 the maximum sentence for a breach of Article 284 DCC – the offence involving the use of 
force – was revised precisely with a view to enforcing the ban on forced marriages more effectively under 
criminal law.81 That is another route by which forced marriages that occur under coercion can be pre-
vented, and one that States are in fact encouraged to follow in the Council of Europe Convention that was 
recently ratified by the Netherlands.82 Similarly, criminal law could be used against parents who encour-
age or promote the consummation of a marriage. It goes without saying that criminal exploitation with-
in a marriage should also be punished under criminal law

4.1.6.2 Identifying criminal exploitation
The second problem relates to the identification and recognition of cases of criminal exploitation as 
human trafficking. In practice, employees of front-line agencies that encounter criminal exploitation 
lack the knowledge to recognize it. Cases are not always seen in the context of sexual exploitation and 
human trafficking and efforts are devoted entirely to investigating or prosecuting the offence, gener-
ally theft.83 It is important that front-line agencies  –  the police, municipalities and partners in the 
health-care chain  – are given the training needed to recognize signs of human trafficking. This is in fact 
an obligation arising from the EU Human Trafficking Directive84 and has also been recommended in a 
number of studies.85 It is therefore important to invest in training for front-line professionals to enable 
them to recognize signs of human trafficking. 86 Otherwise, there is a risk that the authorities will wrong-
ly fail to treat situations of criminal exploitation as instances of hu-
man trafficking, that signs of human trafficking will be missed and 
that victims will not receive the protection they need and are entitled 
to. Training front-line professionals will not be easy. Apart from a 
lack of time, it sometimes seems that the structure of the law-en-
forcement system is not designed to deal with cases within a human 

80 In 2014, the programme provided subsidies for a number of projects by municipalities designed to address the ex-
ploitation of Roma children from a different perspective. The projects will end at the end of 2016 and a review is 
currently underway of measures that can be taken to safeguard the results that have been achieved. It is important 
that the national government and the municipalities continue to devote attention to the problems in order to en-
sure that the information gathered in the course of the programme is not lost.

bul, 11 May 2011), Bulletin of Treaties. 2012, 233. 
83 Reports of this are not in fact confined to the Netherlands. Numerous reports refer to a lack of knowledge on the 

part of front-line services which sometimes leads to cases wrongly not being treated as human trafficking. See, for 
example, European Commission, 2015: pp. 47 and 81; Anti-Slavery International, 2014.

84 See also Article 18(3) of the EU Human Trafficking Directive: ‘Member States shall promote regular training for offi-
cials likely to come into contact with victims or potential victims of trafficking in human beings, including front-line 
police officers, aimed at enabling them to identify and deal with victims and potential victims of trafficking in hu-
man beings.’

trafficking framework. For example, ‘high volume crimes’ are generally disposed of with mechanisms 
that are primarily designed to promote speed and efficiency (the so-called ‘ZSM method’. [ZSM stands for 
Zo Spoedig Mogelijk, or As Quickly as Possible]87). In the case of criminal exploitation, however, the 
protection of the child should prevail over speed and efficiency in the administration of justice. If there 
are signs of criminal exploitation, the departments that specialize in human trafficking within an or-
ganization should be contacted as soon as an arrest has been made. In the police force, these would be 
the certified human trafficking detectives, for example. At the PPS, it would be the human trafficking 
portfolio holder in each district and in the National Public Prosecutor’s Office. The National Rapporteur 
welcomes the fact that research is currently being conducted with the aim of designing an integrated 
programme to combat the criminal exploitation of children.88

4.1.6.3 The role of the non-punishment principle in relation to criminal exploitation
The third problem follows from the second one. It concerns the question of whether children should 
be prosecuted or punished for criminal offences they were forced to commit in a human trafficking 
context.89 The undesirability of this has led to the formulation of the so-called ‘non-punishment prin-
ciple’ in international and European law. This principle, which has been incorporated in the Council 
of Europe Convention and the EU Directive on Human Trafficking,90 prescribes that States must take 
measures to ensure that the authorities are entitled not to prosecute and/or punish victims of human 
trafficking for crimes committed in a trafficking situation.91 Although application of the principle is 
not, strictly speaking, mandatory, a strong encouragement to States to waive prosecution and punish-
ment for victims can be imputed to it.92 Unfortunately, that is not always done, as was apparent from 
the case in which the uncle induced his nephews to commit a burglary.93 Children should not be pros-
ecuted and punished for crimes they are forced to commit in a 
human trafficking situation. That applies both for children who 
are part of a family living in the Netherlands and/or those in a 
mobile Roma community. Prosecution and punishment should 
be an ultimum remedium and therefore avoided as far as possi-
ble. However, the National Rapporteur has received reports that 
this is not always the case. Firstly, because children are not always recognized as victims of human 
trafficking, as in the example given above. There are also occasions when children are prosecuted in 
the belief that not to prosecute would send the wrong signal to parents or other members of the fam-
ily, namely that using children to commit criminal offences will not have any consequences. Whatever 
one might think of these arguments, it is always important to realize the background against which the 
crimes were committed and the consequences a conviction will have for the child concerned (psycho-
logical problems, for example, but also the social impact of having a criminal record). Another ques-

abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.

tion that needs to be asked is whether there are alternative routes that could be followed, which would 
be more appropriate than the use of criminal law. For example, punishing those who exploit children 
would seem a more effective deterrent than punishing those they have exploited. It also goes without 
saying that handling a situation via the youth-care services will produce better results for children than 
criminal proceedings, which can have a huge impact, particularly on young children. Although the 
non-punishment principle has become more firmly established in the policy on criminal procedure in 
recent years,94 it is important that it continues to receive attention in both the investigation and the 
prosecution chain. The National Rapporteur has received reports that the principle is not always inter-
preted uniformly and that similar situations are consequently assessed differently. It is therefore rec-
ommended that the parties in the criminal justice chain endeavour to create greater uniformity in the 
application of the principle, for example by formulating a clearer policy on the interpretation of the 
principle and of the situations in which it applies.

4.1.6.4 The protection of victims of criminal exploitation
The fourth issue relates to the question of how children who are victims of exploitation can best be 
protected. Is returning a child to a family that might include the exploiter the preferred option, bearing 
in mind the risk of revictimization? At first glance, it would not appear so, but the familial context in 
which the crimes were committed does make it more difficult to find a correct solution in these situa-
tions. There does not seem to be any ready answer. Ultimately this dilemma has to be addressed on a 
case-by-case basis, with the appropriate measures being determined according to the child’s interests in 
each specific case. Sometimes a child protection measure will be needed, sometimes not. Although it is 
difficult to formulate general principles, the youth-care services or the Child Care and Protection Board 
should always be consulted. Furthermore, there should always be consultation with the relevant school 
attendance officer, who can then enquire whether the child is registered at a school and, if so, whether 
the child actually attends classes.95 Municipalities should also share best practices in order to develop 
the best approach to dealing with this complex issue, for example through the existing Programme to 
Combat the Exploitation of Roma Children. It is also important to retain a centre of expertise on this 
subject when that programme ends in 2016. The involvement of both central government and munici-
palities is essential for ensuring that the problem continues to receive the necessary attention.

4.1.6.5 Children who are members of mobile groups
Children who are members of a mobile group that migrates around Europe are more difficult to protect. 
There are warnings from professionals that the major problem in relation to these children is establish-
ing the identity of both the child and the person claiming to be the child’s parent or guardian. It is also 
difficult to design a comprehensive approach to the problem because of the obstacles to tracking the 
mobile group’s whereabouts at any given time. There have been occasions when a child from a mobile 
group, who has been arrested and released again, has never been seen again because the group has 
moved. It is important for this unusual context to be taken into account in every decision that is made 
with regard to these children. For example, the mobile nature of the group could be explicitly consid-
ered when decisions are being made on whether a child protection measure should be requested or

ordered. Another recommendation is that the child should only be returned to the family if it has been 
properly established that the child is directly related to members of the group.

4.1.7 Concrete actions
This study of the vulnerability of children from Roma communities has produced a worrying picture. For 
example, there have been several cases in recent years in which children have been forced by family 
members to steal on the street, a form of criminal exploitation and therefore human trafficking. The 
review has shown that Roma children are vulnerable to human trafficking for various reasons (poverty, 
absence from school). A link has also been found to exist between human trafficking and sexual violence 
against children, on the one hand, and arranged child marriages on the other. The discussion has shown 
that insufficient use is made of criminal-law instruments to combat this problem. Since there is now 
sufficient evidence to assume that children who are members of a Roma community are vulnerable to 
human trafficking, and it has been shown that some actually are victims of human trafficking, the anal-
ysis of this group leads to their being assigned to the category ‘Concrete actions’. The steps that need to 
be taken have been described above and are discussed further in Chapter 6.

4.2  Children living illegally in the Netherlands who have to work within a family

4.2.1 Vulnerability of children living illegally in the Netherlands 
Children living illegally in the Netherlands are, by definition, vulnerable to human trafficking, although 
they are not all equally vulnerable. For example, some may be living in a relatively safe social environ-
ment, for example because they are taken in by relatives already living in the Netherlands, legally or il-
legally. Unfortunately, however, although families play a protective role in many children’s lives, that is 
not always the case. In the European Commission’s study into vulnerable groups that was referred to 
earlier, it specifically referred to children who are subjected to a ‘migration project’ organized by their 
family. This is not always their own family; it can also relate to children who are taken in by other fami-
lies and who – as time passes  – become a de facto member of the new family (extended family). In addition 
to the vulnerability inherent to these children’s illegal status, their situation in the ‘new family’ often 
also creates vulnerability. Children who are living illegally in the Netherlands will generally not speak 
the language and are therefore far less able to establish roots in Dutch society. The closed setting in 
which they live – within a family – also makes it difficult for the authorities to keep track of them. These 
children generally have little contact with people outside the family, never mind Dutch agencies.

There have been a number of cases in recent years in which children living illegally in the Nether-
lands have been required to work for years for a family, either their own or another. These are children 
who are forced to work, do not attend school and are often deprived of any contact with Dutch society. 
It is particularly difficult for them to report their situation because of their illegal status, a status that 
exploiters can use to blackmail the child: ‘Make a complaint and you will be arrested.’ An additional 
factor is that the children who have to work for a family are, by definition, subject to the family’s author-
ity. The parents or other family members are automatically in a dominant position because of their re-
lationship to the underage members of the family. In that context, the child can also easily be intimi-
dated with the threat that failing to perform the work properly or refusing to perform it any longer will 
embarrass the family.96 It is hard to imagine that this would not be an effective mechanism for keeping 
children in a state of dependence.

4.2.2 Nature and scale of the problem
Little research has been conducted into the exploitation in families of children who are living illegally 
in the Netherlands, and the hidden nature of this phenomenon makes it difficult to say how serious the 
problem is. There is also a lack of research into the reasons for this type of exploitation or the motives 
of exploiters and the mechanisms they use to keep children in a state of dependence. In 2013, Kaandorp 
and Blaak briefly touched on the situation of children working in households.97 Their report mentions 
the case of a Ugandan girl who was brought to the Netherlands by a diplomat stationed here to perform 
household duties and to care for the diplomat’s children. The researchers point out that the exploitation 
of children in a household seems to occur primarily within families, and most frequently involves niec-
es and daughters, who have to do the cleaning, care for the children in the household, do the shopping 
and act as an interpreter for the adults in the family. Kaandorp and Blaak observe that the children 
sometimes appear to perform the domestic work in return for being allowed to live with a family already 
settled in the Netherlands.98

4.2.3 Cases in the Netherlands
As mentioned above, it is difficult to express a judgment about the nature and scale of the problem. The 
information that is known is mainly anecdotal in nature. At the same time, there have been a number 
of cases in recent years in which people who have forced children to work in a family for years have been 
prosecuted for human trafficking. These cases are discussed below.

4.2.3.1 Case 1: Exploitation in the household99

A recent case that came before The Hague District Court involved a girl who was believed to be six or 
seven years of age100 when she was brought from Morocco101 to the Netherlands by the suspect. The 
suspect had contacted the girl’s father in Morocco, who had given his consent for her to go to the Neth-
erlands to perform domestic work for the suspect and care for his handicapped daughter. The girl herself 
declared that she had been ‘sold’ by her father to the suspect. The 
suspect took the girl into his home in the Netherlands, where for 
seven years she had to perform household duties and was en-
tirely responsible for caring for the handicapped daughter. She 
had to get up at 7.00 a.m. every day and help the daughter to get 
up, shower and get dressed. She was also required to clean the 
house every day. The girl’s freedom of movement was restricted; she was not allowed outside the kitch-
en. She was also told that if she contacted the police she would be sent back to her own country. During 
the period of more than seven years the girl was never paid for her work. She also never attended school 
and was deprived of any form of medical care. She did have occasional contact with doctors, but that was 
to assist the suspect’s handicapped daughter. In 2012, when the girl was seventeen, she ran away from 
the family. Shortly afterwards she made a complaint to the police. The suspect received an uncondi-
tional prison sentence of 24 months and was prohibited from having any contact with the girl or her 
family for a period of two years.

4.3.3.2 Case 2: Exploitation of niece by uncle and aunt102

This case involved a Turkish girl who was approximately ten years of age when she came to the Nether-
lands with her aunt in 2000. The girl had previously been abused by her father, because he blamed her 
in part for her mother’s adultery. On arrival in the Netherlands, the girl moved in with her uncle, who 
had been living in the Netherlands with his family for some time. No residence permit was ever re-
quested for her. She also did not go to school or receive medical care. From the age of thirteen, the girl 
was expected to perform domestic work and care for the children in the family. The court found that she 
had been required to perform this work for seven years. In the grounds for sentencing, the court found 
that the uncle had violated his niece’s mental integrity and ‘placed his and his wife’s personal comfort 
above that integrity. Through his actions the suspect had deprived the victim of a free and carefree child-
hood.’ The uncle received an unconditional prison sentence of twelve months. The court also prohib-
ited the man from having contact with the niece for two years.

99 The Hague District Court 26 February 2016, ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2016:1968.
100 It is not clear from the judgment precisely when the suspect brought the victim to the Netherlands. On the basis of 

the victim’s statement  – that she was six or seven at the time  – it will have been 2001 or 2002. The period covered in 
the indictment was only from 1 January 2005, the date on which exploitation outside the sex industry was also crimi-
nalized in the Netherlands in Article 273a (old) DCC.

4.2.3.3 Case 3: Exploitation of nephew by uncles103

A Turkish man living in the Netherlands decided, during a visit to Turkey, to take his nephew back with 
him to the Netherlands. The 14-year-old nephew was informed that he would have a better future in the 
Netherlands. On arrival, however, the nephew was quickly put to work by his uncle in his drapery shop 
in Amsterdam. He generally worked six days a week, for around nine or ten hours a day. The work per-
formed by the nephew consisted of moving rolls of fabric, loading and unloading lorries with fabric and 
helping his two uncles in the drapery shop. The nephew ultimately worked in the uncles’ shop for more 
than eight years. For all that time the nephew was living illegally in the Netherlands and did not go to 
school. He lived in various places, sometimes sleeping in his uncles’ homes, but also regularly staying 
with his grandmother and grandfather, who were also living in the Netherlands. The uncles were given 
unconditional prison sentences of 22 and 32 months, respectively.

4.2.4 Problems
These three cases involved children who were exploited for years within families in the Netherlands. In 
each of these cases the child was smuggled to the Netherlands, no residence permit was ever requested 
for the child during their stay in the Netherlands and the child never went to school or received medical 
care. Furthermore, in all three cases the child had to perform onerous work for a lengthy period (ranging 
from seven to more than eight years), and always during a highly formative period of their lives, between 
the ages of ten and eighteen. All of the children in the cases were from the same country as the perpetra-
tors and in two cases they were immediate family.

As this summary shows, there are clear parallels in the cases discussed. Taken as a whole, the cases 
paint a picture of children who were required to work continuously and had to be available at a mo-
ment’s notice to meet the demands made by the family. Naturally there is no immediate solution for 
these situations, which take place largely out of public view. However, there are several observations that 
can be made that should be addressed by specific measures.

First, children living illegally in the Netherlands who perform work in a household generally remain 
hidden from public view. In these cases, every occasion when a child does have social contact can be 
crucial, because they provide an opportunity to recognize the child’s situation and report it, for example 
to the police, the municipality or Stichting M (Report Crime Anonymously). A few examples derived 
from the first of the cases described above illustrate where and how such contact can be established in 
situations like this.

Opportunities for establishing contact in case 1
A home-care worker visited the suspect’s home for one day a week over a lengthy period. During 
that time she observed that the girl ‘did everything’ for the handicapped daughter. She also not-
ed that the girl was spoken to in a commanding tone by the suspect and that she often had the 
impression that the girl had already cleaned the entire house. The home-care worker also knew 
that the girl assisted the handicapped daughter when she had to visit the doctor.

A hairdresser who cut the hair of the family members on several occasions declared that the girl 
was always busy keeping the house clean.

103 Amsterdam District Court 3 December 2013, ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2013:8461.



90
Vulnerability up Close

The manager of the complex that included the suspect’s home declared that the girl ‘did nothing 
but clean’ and never went out alone. He had the feeling that the girl was treated as a ‘slave’ by 
the suspect.

Various neighbours observed that the girl was always working. She never left the house alone 
and often cared for the handicapped daughter. One of the neighbours had the impression that 
the girl was a ‘glorified domestic help’. He doubted whether the girl was living voluntarily in the 
house.

It is evident from Case 1 that there were various occasions when someone or other could have reported 
the girl’s situation. Occasions when there is contact with a possible victim of human trafficking are es-
sential for identifying them, especially when the trafficking occurs in private settings such as house-
holds. It is very important to inform the general public about human trafficking so that people can 
identify possible human trafficking situations and to encourage them to report it. It is also important 
for certain categories of professionals, such as GPs and dentists, to receive training in how to recognize 
human trafficking.104 Visits by the children to these professionals can be very valuable because of the 
opportunity they provide to learn more about the children’s situation and to report it. There have been 
some recent initiatives to help medical professionals to recognize victims of human trafficking, for ex-
ample by the Belgian organization Payoke.105 It is also important for steps to be taken to increase the 
knowledge about human trafficking among medical practitioners in the Netherlands and so increase 
the possibility of human trafficking situations being identified and reported.

A second observation relates to academic and policy-related research into the issue of children living 
illegally in the Netherlands who have to work in families. As already mentioned, the nature and size of 
this group of children is not known, so it is important to learn more about them. As we have seen, in all 
of the cases described above, all of which were heard by the courts between 2013 and 2016, children were 
deprived of fundamental rights during their formative years.

4.2.5 Concrete actions
As this section has illustrated, children who are living illegally in the Netherlands are, by definition, 
particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. The cases discussed also showed that these children are 
abused, abuse that can culminate in a human trafficking situation. In those cases children living ille-
gally in the Netherlands were exploited for years and were deprived of a normal childhood and develop-
ment. In light of the findings, this group is assigned to the category ‘Concrete actions’, which should 
consist mainly of measures to increase the general public’s knowledge of human trafficking, but more 
especially the expertise of professionals such as family doctors and dentists. More research is also need-
ed to determine the nature and size of this group of children in the Netherlands.

104 Although the girl in case 1 was deprived of medical care, it is likely that even hidden victims will come into contact 
with medical professionals if urgent care is required.

105 Payoke has produced a guide for medical professionals with advice on how to recognize human trafficking and what 
to do if they encounter a possible victim. The handbook can be found at www.payoke.be/websites/52/uploads/file/
Guide For Practitioners.pdf, consulted on 2 March 2016.

5 Children working in production chains

Child labour is outlawed worldwide, but nevertheless still occurs on a 
large scale. The Dutch government and the business sector have an ob-
ligation to prevent child labour in production chains. A characteristic of 
the existing obligation is its non-binding nature; companies can choose 
to sign up voluntarily to particular sets of rules, but the rules are not 
enforced on a scale sufficient to make them effective. Various interna-
tional treaties and the EU’s Human Trafficking Directive appear to pre-
scribe a more binding system. Child labour, and measures to prevent it, 
should be approached more from the perspective of human trafficking 
so that the obligation to prevent child labour is more compelling for Dutch companies and the govern-
ment. On the basis of this analysis, this group of children is assigned to the category ‘Concrete action’.

5.1 Introduction

Despite a significant drop in the number of children at work, child labour is still common. According to 
a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), 168 million children perform work worldwide, 
85 million of whom have to perform dangerous work.1 Combating child labour demands a comprehen-
sive approach that also addresses the underlying ‘root causes’  – such as poverty, unemployment and the 
absence of a properly functioning education system (structural 
vulnerability). It is also important to prosecute anyone who per-
mits child labour. However, in addition to tackling the countries 
where child labour takes place, it is also essential to adopt meas-
ures in the countries where the products manufactured with 
child labour are purchased. The Dutch economy depends heavily 
on other countries.2 A good example chosen at random is toys: 
75% of the toys sold in the Netherlands are produced in China. Naturally, the toys produced in China are 
not all manufactured by children, but China is one of the countries where the risk of child labour is 
greatest.3

5.2 Child labour is a form of exploitation and human trafficking

Child labour takes many forms and occurs in many contexts. The fact is that child labour is sometimes 
not even seen as a problem. Work performed by children that does not affect their attendance at school, 
does not damage their health and contributes to their personal development is even regarded as posi-
tive.4 However, if that is not the case the consequences of child labour are without exception very harm-
ful; children are deprived of education and their personal development, and hence their prospects of a 
better future, is impaired. Child labour is also cheap labour, thus 
sustaining a market with low prices. An important ILO conven-
tion lists the ‘worst forms of child labour’.5 Because they repre-
sent the most urgent problems in relation to child labour, the 
Convention imposes far-reaching obligations on States in rela-
tion to them. One of the ‘worst forms of child labour’ is labour 
similar to slavery, which is defined in the Convention as includ-
ing trafficking in children and forced or compulsory labour. These are forms of exploitation, and there-
fore constitute human trafficking.

together and if you continue to use the labor of

that deprives children of their childhood, their 
potential and their dignity, and that is harmful 
to physical and mental development’ [Interna-

5.3 Children vulnerable to human trafficking in other countries

The 168 million children who were found to be performing work worldwide in the ILO study represent 
almost 11% of the total number of children on earth.6 Children are desirable workers not only because 
they are cheaper than adults, but also because they are less articulate and therefore easier to control.7 
There are also a number of institutional factors that make children vulnerable to this form of exploita-
tion. For example, a report by UNICEF8 shows that a high level of poverty is a major factor in explaining 
child labour. The definition of the term ‘child’ is another factor mentioned in the report. In some cul-
tures, for example, children are regarded as adults at an earlier age than in the West and the society 
therefore considers it legitimate that they should also take part in the labour process. A third factor 
mentioned by UNICEF is access to education. Particularly in poor countries where education is rela-
tively expensive, families frequently choose to have their children work rather than go to school in order 
to save the expense of education and bring in what the child can contribute to the family’s income.

Although child labour occurs in many more countries and regions,9 this section focuses on three 
locations in different regions of the world where child labour occurs on a large scale. These countries 
have also been selected because child exploitation occurs in three different sectors and Dutch compa-
nies operate in all three countries. Naturally this does not mean that companies that trade with these 
countries are guilty of permitting child labour, but it does mean that they need to be particularly vigi-
lant.

One of the countries where child labour occurs very frequently is Bangladesh. According to a report 
by UNICEF, more than five million children are at work in that country.10 In a study by the International 
Trade Union Confederation, it was even argued that there are more like seven million children working 
there, of whom 1.3 million are ‘engaged in the worst forms of child labour’.11 One sector that employs a 
large number of children is the Bengali textile and clothing industry,12 which is one of the largest in the 
world and accounts for roughly 80% of the country’s gross national product.13 The industry employs 
approximately four million people, but it is uncertain what percentage of them are children. The col-
lapse in 2013 of the Rana Plaza, an eight-storey building where clothing was mass produced for Western 
companies and in which more than 1,100 persons died, drew a lot of international attention to the 
working conditions in Bangladesh. Although improvements have been made, many employees still find

themselves in a very vulnerable position.14 An additional problem is that child labour is often already 
used before the start of the production process in Bangladesh, for example in Uzbekistan where much 
of the cotton is picked, and in India where the cotton is spun into fabric.15

A second region in which child labour increasingly occurs is West and Central Africa. According to 
estimates by UNICEF,16 a third of all children in the region work full-time, sometimes paid and some-
times unpaid.. One sector that employs a relatively large number of children is the cocoa industry. A 
recent study estimated that two million children are working as ‘child labourers’ on cocoa plantations 
in Ivory Coast and Ghana, 360,000 more than in 2009.17 According to the researchers, more than 64% of 
the workers on the cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and 14% in Ghana are minors, and a large proportion 
of them work under dangerous conditions. These figures should also be a cause for concern in the Neth-
erlands, which is the world’s largest importer of cocoa beans.18 According to a report by KidsRights and 
the University of Leiden,19 more than 95% of the cocoa beans imported by the Netherlands come from 
West Africa, mostly from Ivory Coast and Ghana.

A final sector in which there is a high level of child labour is mining. An estimated one million chil-
dren are working in gold mines, for example.20 Companies operating in the metal and electronics sec-
tors face a particular risk of being affected by this.21 One country where child labour occurs on a rela-
tively large scale in the mining industry is Peru, which is one of the largest gold producers in the world.22 
Research by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) has shown that roughly 
50,000 children are working in the country’s gold mines, an industry with a total workforce of between 
100,000 and 500,000 employees.23 There are also reports that children are given cocaine so that they can 
work longer hours and to still their hunger pangs.24

5.4  Child labour and the responsibility of companies established in the 
Netherlands for their subcontractors

Child labour seems remote, but the Dutch economy’s dependence on international trade means that 
Dutch companies can be links in the chains in which child labour occurs. A study in 2014 showed that

Children working in production chains

the Netherlands depends heavily on foreign industries in which child labour occurs,25 illustrating that 
child labour is not so distant as we might sometimes think. That is not to say that the phenomenon 
occurs ‘close to home’. Production chains are usually lengthy and opaque,26 and it is often difficult to 
reconstruct the precise origin of a product because of the number of producers and sub-producers in the 
chain.27 In addition to the physical distance, this creates a mental distance that can result in producers 
shifting responsibility for the production process to other companies in the chain. This is why the pol-
icy measures that have been taken to combat child labour in the production chains of Dutch companies 
have focused mainly on getting companies to analyse their own production chains in order to deter-
mine whether child labour occurs in the chain or where the greatest risk of child labour lies.

This ‘requirement of transparency’ is an important component of the UN Ruggie framework, for 
example, and is also to be found in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on corporate 
social responsibility.28 The Ruggie framework prescribes that States – and companies – have an obliga-
tion to protect citizens against violations of human rights. Companies have the duty to respect human 
rights and to conduct due diligence to prevent child labour in their production chains.29 In addition to 
this ‘requirement of transparency’, many sectors have taken measures themselves to arrange inspec-
tions at the factories from which they source their products. For example, more intensive supervision 
and enforcement by inspection agencies was one of the principal instruments adopted following the 
collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh. These initiatives are most common in the regulation 
of companies that operate in other countries and are part of what are often lengthy production chains. 
Individual sectors have also taken initiatives to prevent the use of products that are the result of child 
labour.30

A striking feature of these initiatives is the voluntary nature of participation in them. Although com-
panies are encouraged to join the initiatives, and in some cases their reputation and government financ-
ing depends on it, there is often no accompanying legislation that can actually be enforced, for example 

25 Hendriksen and Tholen, 2014: p. 73. 
26 The lengthy production chain makes it difficult to adopt measures. For that reason, the Minister for Foreign Trade 

and Development Cooperation is critical of a private member’s policy document from the House of Representatives 
(which is discussed below) calling for the introduction of a ban in the Netherlands on the sale of products of child 
labour (policy document submitted by Van Laar): ‘The relevant child labour will usually have taken place abroad, 
sometimes in remote areas and at the end of a lengthy production chain’ (Parliamentary Documents II 2014/15, 33 963, 
no. 5, p. 6). See also the recent study by Amnesty International into child labour in the mining of cobalt (Amnesty, 
2016). 

27 This also makes it very difficult to determine at which point in the production chain inspections should take place. 
It has also been found in practice that the lack of transparency in production chains can be consciously used by 
producers to fend off inspection agencies. For example, it is known that products are moved between bad factories 
(where the products are actually manufactured) and ‘model factories’ (where the inspection takes place). On this 
point, see Clifford and Greenhouse, ‘Fast and Flawed Inspections of Factories Abroad’, New York Times, 2 September 
2013, p. A1: ‘The inspections are often so superficial that they omit the most fundamental workplace safeguards like fire escapes. And 
even when inspectors are tough, factory managers find ways to trick them and hide serious violations, like child labor or locked exit doors.’

with sanctions. Although this says nothing about the effectiveness of the rules, enforcement does some-
times appear to leave a gap; there is no possibility for the State to impose sanctions, in addition to 
measures geared to ‘compliance’, if investigations show that companies are doing too little to prevent 
child labour in their chains.

5.5 Problems

Child labour is a complex, diverse and multi-faceted phenomenon. Child labour is also entwined with 
larger themes for which there is no obvious solution. What is needed is a comprehensive approach that 
transcends specific policy areas and national boundaries. The fact that child labour occurs primarily in 
production chains in countries outside Europe must not be a reason for shutting our eyes to the prob-
lem. The interaction between the Dutch economy and other countries and the country’s enormous 
dependence on production chains in which there is a risk of child labour should actually provide an 
impulse to continue developing new measures to eliminate the risk of child labour and to end the sale 
and use of products that are the result of child labour.

A drawback of many of the measures that have been taken up to now is that they are non-binding. 
That is the first issue that needs to be addressed in relation to this problem. A characteristic of both the 
Ruggie framework and the OECD guidelines  – instruments that are relevant in this context  – is that 
subscribing to them is voluntary. Naturally, the same applies for covenants drawn up by individual sec-
tors. Another factor is that it is difficult to force companies to comply with these standards of corporate 
social responsibility by law.31 That is not to say that non-participation or non-compliance with such 
standards never has any consequences; the Dutch government, for example, ‘expects’ multinational 
enterprises established in the Netherlands to adhere to the Ruggie framework and the OECD guidelines, 
and non-compliance can result in the government withdrawing financing from them or refusing to 
procure goods or services from them.32 Nevertheless, enforcement of these rules remains difficult and 
there are no instruments for direct intervention.33 An effort should be made to find ways of improving 
the enforceability of the rules of corporate social responsibility, for example by anchoring in law the 
duty of care that these rule impose on enterprises.34 Another option would be to legislate that compa-

31 For greater detail on this point , see the dissertation by Louise Vytopil, in which she concludes that multinationals 
are practically immune under civil law and are difficult to sue for breaches of rules falling under the heading of 
corporate social responsibility. Vytopil draws the tentative conclusion ‘[…] that the law at this moment perhaps does 
not have much to offer in terms of long-term improvement of CSO conditions in trade chains’ (Vytopil, 2015). See 
also Vytopil, 2016. 

32 For more information on this point, see www.oesorichtlijnen.nl, consulted on 2 September 2015. 
33 Also illustrative is that the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation leaves the initiative for corpo-

rate social responsibility mainly with the business sector. The government’s position is one of ‘facilitating’ and 
‘activating’. But the minister has also said that ‘voluntary agreements are not without obligation as far as the govern-
ment is concerned. We will hold talks about the underlying reasons with parties that do not make sufficient effort 
to reach ICSR agreements in relation to the risks indicated in the SRA’ (letter from the Minister for Foreign Trade and 
Development Cooperation and the Minister of Economic Affairs of 19 November 2014 concerning the CSR Sector Risk 
Analysis). 

34 To this end, the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation has commissioned research by the Utrecht 
Centre for Accountability and Liability Law. The results are expected in the spring of 2016. See also the reply to ques-
tions from member of parliament Gesthuizen (SP) about the absence of adequate mechanisms to hold multination-
als liable for disasters that occur further up the production chain, 1 September 2015, MINBUZA-2015.476172.

Children working in production chains

nies have a duty to be transparent about their own production chains and the measures they have taken 
to prevent child labour in their chains, as the United Kingdom did recently.35

Another possibility might be the introduction of a prohibition − subject to criminal sanctions if 
necessary − on the sale of products that have been manufactured with child labour. Member of parlia-
ment Van Laar drafted a private member’s policy paper on this subject in 2014, which is being amended 
in response to a debate on it in parliament.36 The Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Coop-
eration has also referred to the fact that the article on human trafficking in national law could play a role 
in shaping a ban on such sales; for example, Article 273f (1)(6) DCC, which criminalizes profiting from 
the exploitation of another person, could be used in these cases.37 To date, this provision has not in fact 
been used in this type of case. If the minister feels it should be, it would have to be discussed with the 
PPS via the Minister of Security and Justice. This approach seems to have little chance of success, how-
ever, especially since the requirement was recently introduced that to prove this offence it also has to be 
shown the perpetrator also intended the exploitation itself.38

The second problem is connected with the first one, particularly the observation that the debate 
about how child labour can or should be prevented is not being conducted in terms of human traffick-
ing. What stands out, for example, is that although the relevant ILO Conventions and soft law – instru-
ments such as the Ruggie framework or the OECD guidelines –  are always referred to, no mention is 
made of the instruments relating to human trafficking that have been adopted by various international 
organizations. This is all the more striking since the provisions of the conventions and the directive 
provide a roadmap for further defining the obligations of States and enterprises in preventing child la-
bour. For example, in Article 19 of the Council of Europe Convention, States are asked to consider mak-
ing it a criminal offence ‘to use services which are the object of exploitation […], with the knowledge that 
the person is a victim of trafficking in human beings […]’.39 Article 18(4) of the EU Directive is phrased in 
similar terms and calls on States to consider ‘taking measures to establish as a criminal offence the use 
of services which are the object of exploitation […], with the knowledge that the person is the victim of 
an offence referred to in Article 2 [human trafficking]’.40 At the moment, there is a great deal of uncer-
tainty about the precise scope of these articles and there is also no obligation to create a criminal of-
fence; States are only asked to ‘consider’ criminalizing those actions. However, those provisions are 
relevant for the present discussion and it is worth recommending that in future more account be taken 
of them in the debate about the duties of governments and enterprises to prevent child labour in pro-
duction chains. In short, the human trafficking perspective must assume a more prominent role in 
discussions about child labour, and what governments and companies must do to prevent it.

35 Such a statutory duty was recently introduced in the United Kingdom with the entry into force of the Modern Slavery 
Act. Article 54 of that act prescribes a duty for large companies to publish an annual report setting out the measures 
the company has taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in the production chain or in other parts of the 
company. It also includes specific obligations with regard to the approval and publication of these reports.

of a ban on sales. The trade restrictions that such a ban would entail are problematic in light of the free movement 
of goods (under EU law) and some of the World Trade Organisation’s principles.

5.6 Concrete actions

In light of the vulnerability of children highlighted here and the 
fact that human traffickers actively recruit children in production 
chains, this group of children is assigned to the category ‘Con-
crete action’. As mentioned above, it is particularly important to 
work towards a more robust statutory basis for obligations in the 
field of corporate social responsibility. It is also important to consider problems relating to corporate 
social responsibility more from the perspective of human trafficking.

‘The human trafficking perspective must as-
sume a more prominent role in discussions 
about child labour, and what governments and 
companies must do to prevent it’.



6 Groups that are vulnerable to human trafficking

6.1 Groups that are vulnerable to human trafficking

In the last fifteen years, the definition of human trafficking has steadily expanded. Not only was the 
definition of the crime of human trafficking expanded in 2005 to include forms of exploitation outside 
the sex industry, in recent years the concept of exploitation has also been broadened to encompass more 
sectors and vulnerable groups. Whether it is the boy who sets up his uncle’s market stall every day, the 
girl who is forced to have sex or the boy who is forced to steal a television, they are all victims of human 
trafficking. It is essential to remain alert to human trafficking even in situations one would not auto-
matically associate with exploitation. This is precisely the purpose of this study: to provide an insight 
into new groups of children who might also be vulnerable to human trafficking.

Seven groups are discussed in this exploratory study, which addressed two key questions:

(1) To what extent are there indications that these groups of children are vulnerable to human traffickers?
(2) To what extent are there indications that human traffickers specifically target these groups?

In Figure X the groups are ranked in relation to each other in terms of their vulnerability and the actions 
that need to be considered as a priority for each group are identified.1 Each group is assigned to one of 
the four following categories: (a) concrete action, (b) concrete action and research, (c) research and prevention and 
(d) vigilance.2 

1 The categorization used in this report is nevertheless a snapshot and is based on an exploration of the different 
vulnerable groups that have been linked to human trafficking (see also Chapter 1).

Groups that are vulnerable to human trafficking
101

As Figure X shows, the seven groups fall into three of the four categories. None of them falls into the 
category in the top right segment of the figure. This is not surprising, since human traffickers are un-
likely to target a group to which few of the risk factors apply because of the additional effort it would 
take to entice members of these less vulnerable groups into a situation of exploitation and keep them 
there. It is therefore logical that human traffickers choose not to do so. The other three categories are 
discussed below, together with a description of the next steps that could be taken with respect to each 
group.

6.2 Concrete steps

Concerns Roma children (Section 4.1), children living illegally in the Netherlands who have to work in families (Section 4.2) 
and children working in production chains (Chapter 5)

Groups that are found to be vulnerable and specifically targeted by human traffickers should receive 
priority and deserve the most comprehensive protection. Wherever possible, specific steps should be 
taken to ensure they receive that protection. In that context, it is important to develop a multidiscipli-
nary approach designed both to protect victims and apprehend and prosecute human traffickers. For 
that purpose, it is important to investigate whether the problems facing these groups are seen from a 
human trafficking perspective and whether enough is being done to ensure they are identified.

Turning to the individual groups in this category, the discussion of the exploitation of Roma children 
revealed that court cases involving theft by these children are only sporadically dealt with in the context 
of human trafficking. Consequently, evidence of human trafficking can be missed. A number of inter-
national legal instruments prescribe training for all front-line professionals who could come into con-
tact with possible victims of human trafficking: providing education and training is therefore an obliga-
tion under international and European law. Units of the police force and the PPS that do not specialise 
in human trafficking but could come into contact with possible victims should also receive more train-
ing than they do at present. They would include the units responsible for investigating and prosecuting 
cases of theft involving minors aged twelve or older. In cases where there is a suspicion that a crime has 
been committed by a person in a human trafficking situation, it is important for the human trafficking 
specialists within the organization to be consulted. Furthermore, the non-punishment principle should 
automatically apply in these cases. If there appears to have been coercion, the principle serves as an 
important contraindication for prosecution: ‘in principle not, unless’.3

Identification is also the key when it comes to arranged child marriages within the Roma commu-
nity. The challenge here is being able to recognize plans for a marriage at an early stage. This is very 
difficult in practice, but some indicators have clearly emerged in this study. The basic principle is that 
arranged marriages of minors must be prevented. This report expresses a preference for an approach 
that explores the possibilities of applying criminal law. There are a number of criminal offences that 
could possibly apply in relation to an arranged child marriage, from the perspective of both human 
trafficking and sexual violence against children. This report explored whether the arranged marriage of 
a minor can in itself be regarded as a form of human trafficking. It has also drawn attention to the ele-
ment of criminal exploitation associated with an arranged marriage, both prior to and after the wed-

3 De Meijer and Simmelink regard the principle as a contra-indication to prosecution (De Meijer and Simmelink, 2014: 
p. 242).



102

ding. Finally, minors should not be required to consummate their marriage in a created setting. The PPS 
should devote more attention to the prosecution of parents who arrange the consummation of a mar-
riage involving minors.

Identification is also important in relation to children who are living illegally in the Netherlands and 
are forced to work in families. Providing better information to the public about this form of human 
trafficking could make a world of difference. These children have only sporadic contact with other peo-
ple and agencies, because they are consciously secluded from the ‘outside world’. Any form of contact 
that there is should therefore be seen as an opportunity to identify human trafficking. It is important to 
increase public awareness of human trafficking, but also to ensure that professionals who could en-
counter human trafficking in a professional capacity know what they need to look out for. For example, 
doctors could play a crucial role in identifying children who are living illegally in the Netherlands and 
are forced to work, since appointments with medical professionals are sometimes the only opportuni-
ties for establishing contact with members of this group of victims of human trafficking.

The human trafficking perspective is often lacking in policies to address the problem of children who 
work in the production chains of large companies. When it comes to enforcing the obligations of com-
panies to prevent child labour, the duties arising from policies and legislation in the domain of human 
trafficking should also be considered. That might even mark a step towards the adoption of more le-
gally binding rules for companies on the measures they have to take to prevent human trafficking in 
their production chains.

6.3 Research and prevention

Covers LHBT children (Section 2.2) and Syrian child brides (Section 3.2),

This category covers vulnerable groups that are not specifically targeted by human traffickers. The risk 
factors that were identified nevertheless give sufficient cause to conduct further research and/or address 
the issues that make them vulnerable with a view to preventing human trafficking in the future. Preven-
tive measures might include campaigns to increase awareness of human trafficking among the general 
public or more specifically among professionals who come into contact with these vulnerable groups.4

The first group is LHBT children. Although this group was discussed as a whole, more risk factors 
were identified for homosexual and bisexual boys and transgender boys than for lesbian and bisexual 
girls. Moreover, it was found that young LHBTs who grow up in a migrant or religious community can 
experience more problems because of their sexual orientation, which can sometimes even lead to them 
losing contact with their social environment, forcibly or otherwise. These boys are possibly even more 
vulnerable to sexual violence and human trafficking. No research was found that has specifically exam-
ined the relationship between sexual orientation and human trafficking. Although some studies into 
youth prostitution did look at the sexual orientation of boys who provide sexual services for payment, 
it is not known how many homosexual and bisexual boys are active in male prostitution or whether they 
are exploited. However, the impression that arises from a number of exploratory studies is that sexual 
exploitation of boys, including heterosexual boys, does not occur on a large scale in youth prostitution. 

4 The European Commission says on this point: ‘Awareness-raising campaigns were once again identified as a strong resilience 
factor that can counteract such tendencies in society; however, practitioners warned that such campaigns should be undertaken in a tar-
geted manner, and avoid sensational reporting’ (European Commission, 2015: p. 8).



Groups that are vulnerable to human trafficking
103

Most boys who sell sexual services seem to do so voluntarily, regardless of their sexual orientation. 
However, reservations can be expressed about this conclusion because of the difficulty of forming a clear 
picture of this group of boys in light of the so-called triple taboo: the taboo on homosexuality and bi-
sexuality, the taboo on prostitution and the taboo on boys seeing themselves as victims. This explora-
tory analysis provides plenty of leads for further research to discover more about whether and to what 
extent homosexual, bisexual and transgender boys are victims of human trafficking. One possibility lies 
in the research announced by the Minister of Security and Justice and the State Secretary for Health, 
Welfare and Sport into young male victims of human trafficking.

The second group in this category is Syrian child brides. This group is relatively vulnerable to human 
trafficking. These girls are vulnerable if they find themselves heavily dependent on their husband, be-
come socially isolated and disappear into their home and out of public view. These risks increase if the 
girls are married at a young age to an older man, if fewer conditions are attached to the arranged mar-
riage than used to be the case and if the girls feel they cannot seek a divorce, for example because of the 
threat of honour vengeance. All of these conditions can result in a girl feeling forced to accede to her 
husband’s wishes and, for example, starting a family at a young age and leaving school prematurely. The 
risk of these girls being heavily dependent on the husband is all the greater because they are in a strange 
country where they do not speak the language or know the culture and the law and where they are un-
likely to be aware of where they can go for help if they are victims of sexual violence or exploitation. If 
girls disappear inside the home and go through life as hidden women, it becomes difficult to actively 
spot signs of sexual violence and human trafficking. Consequently, sexual violence, and possibly also 
exploitation, can persist for a long time. Human trafficking could then take the form of years of servi-
tude, with severe restriction of the girl’s liberty, with the result that she remains a captive of her situa-
tion. This is not to say that all these girls end up like this. All this exploratory analysis has shown is that 
they could be vulnerable. It is therefore important to keep this group in sight, and one way of accom-
plishing that is to create opportunities for establishing contact with these girls, so that signs that they 
need protection can be picked up at an early stage.

6.4 Vigilance

Concerns children with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (Section 2.3) and children who join or wish to join ISIS 
(Section 3.3)

This category covers groups that have been found to be at little or no risk of human trafficking or of be-
ing specifically targeted by human traffickers. The only question arising in relation to the groups in this 
category is whether there is a need to remain alert for possible signs of human trafficking.

The exploratory analysis has shown that two groups currently fall into this category. The first is the 
group of children who suffer from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. The members of this group are 
not very vulnerable, with the exception of girls who go online in search of others with the same disorder, 
who might be more at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking. This initial study has also shown 
that there are only slight indications that human traffickers (under the guise of ‘pro-ana coaches’) target 
this group. What signs there are point more in the direction of sexual violence. However, professionals 
who work with girls in this group would be well-advised to remain alert to possible signs of sexual vio-
lence and human trafficking. 

The second group is children who join or wish to join ISIS. There is not yet sufficient empirical re-
search to show whether members of this group, both boys and girls, are particularly vulnerable to hu-



104
Vulnerability up Close

man trafficking or whether they are actively targeted by recruiters whose intention is ot exploit them. 
Nevertheless, it has emerged from exploratory studies and media reports that some children who have 
travelled to join ISIS or were planning to do so may have been recruited by a person who employed 
techniques that are broadly similar to the methods adopted by human traffickers to trap victims in a 
situation of exploitation. This process can include elements such as isolating the victim, creating a posi-
tion of dependence and the use of deception. However, this initial exploratory study has not shown that 
recruiters for ISIS actually have the intention of exploiting young people, so this group has been as-
signed to the category ‘vigilance’. The most obvious requirement is for professionals who work with 
these young people, including those who have returned from Syria and/or Iraq, to remain alert to pos-
sible signs of human trafficking.

6.5 A look ahead

This initial study has provided more insight into the extent to which seven groups of children are vulner-
able to and are in fact victims of human trafficking. This research must continue in the future and should 
also encompass new vulnerable groups, since it has been found that human traffickers are inventive and 
are not averse to exploiting new opportunities if there is money to be earned from it. It is therefore 
important that known phenomena that might be related to human trafficking are also investigated from 
a human trafficking perspective and to remain alert to new phenomena that could have a connection 
with exploitation. There is widespread responsibility for this that extends to everyone with a part to play 
in combating human trafficking: researchers, the police and PPS, NGOs, municipalities, community 
teams, social workers and judges. They can all play a crucial role in combating human trafficking. By 
remaining alert to the many forms and guises that human trafficking can take, together they can take 
effective action against it. That is the major challenge for the future.
