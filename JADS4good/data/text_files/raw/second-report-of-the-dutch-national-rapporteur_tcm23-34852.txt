1 Introduction

This is the English translation of a somewhat shortened and revised version of the
second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings
(NRM). This second report contains supplementary numerical information. It must be
seen and read in conjunction with the first report that contains all sorts of background
information and is of a more reflective nature.

This report presents updated figures together with already published numerical data,
in order to show possible trends. The report includes a lot of tables and makes use of
statistics. For notes on the tables and statistics, as well as notes on the terminology
used please refer to Annex 1.

In the area of THB there are many developments that are all worth mentioning, such
as the change in the law which is being worked on at the moment in the Netherlands,
in connection with the broadening of the definition of trafficking in human beings
(THB),1 the Dutch chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE) and the plan to then put THB prominently on the international
agenda, as well as the consequences of the upcoming enlargement of the European
Union (EU). These developments will be discussed in the third report of the NRM,
which is planned for the end of 2003.

For this report, many people and bodies have made information available. The Bureau
of the Dutch National Rapporteur on THB (BNRM) is very grateful to them for this.
A separate word of thanks goes out – in the order of the chapter layout – to the
Information and Analysis Centre of the IND (INDIAC) for making relevant databases
available, to Mrs. M. Verhoeven for her contribution to the police investigation and to
Mr. P.P.J. Groen of the Statistical Information Supply and Policy Analysis (SiBa)
department of the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (WODC), who
carried out the analyses of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) database for this
report.

Chapter 2 presents data on victims of THB reported to the Dutch Foundation against
Trafficking in Women (STV) in 2001. 
Chapter 3 contains information on B-9 applications2 and the decision taken on these. 
Chapter 4 focuses on investigation by the Dutch police in the field of THB. 
Chapter 5 contains data on THB cases registered with the PPS, their handling by the
PPS and judgement by the court.



2 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

Chapter 6 contains a brief review of the figures regarding prostitution and THB,
originating from research carried out by BNRM and elsewhere.
The final Chapter 7 gives a summary of the data presented in the preceding chapters,
looked at in relationship to one another and with a commentary. No far-reaching
conclusions and recommendations are however given: the conclusions and
recommendations formulated in the first report still apply in full, the cabinet
viewpoint on these has only recently been published and – at the time this second
report was written – still has to be discussed in the Lower House. The next, third,
report will, however, again contain extensive conclusions and recommendations. 
Finally, it is also important to mention that this third report will include figures
regarding 2002 that are comparable with those in the present report. It will then be
clearer whether changes are taking place since the lifting of the general ban on
brothels and, if so, what these are.



1 Because of its history the STV focuses in particular on female victims of THB, the expertise
embodied within the STV also lies mainly in this area and in its publications the Foundation
talks almost exclusively about women and uses the term ‘trafficking in women’ (and not
‘trafficking in human beings’). If, however, male victims are reported to it, they are also
recorded (verbal information from STV).

2 Work is at present being carried out on computerising the record system, for which the STV
received a subsidy in the autumn of 2001.

2 Victim records kept by the Dutch Foundation against
Trafficking in Women

2.1 Introduction

The STV records reports on (possible) victims of THB.1 Reports come for example
from the police, reception facilities, individuals, the Dutch Refugee Council
(Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland) and asylum-seeker centres, as well as from (youth)
victim support organisations. There are also anonymous reports (STV, 2001; 2002).
For a number of reasons the records do not give a realistic picture of the character and
scale of THB in the Netherlands. The STV is dependent on third parties for reports
(STV, 2002). Not all the victims, however, come to the knowledge of these third
parties. In addition, it appears that not all the victims for whom that does apply are
reported to the STV. Furthermore, the fact is that in 2001 the STV was less accessible
because of a lack of resources and due to undermanning, which led to a reduction in
the number of cases reported. A further complication is that to date the STV has been
working with a (non-computerised) record system, which does not distinguish
between requests for advice and consultation on the one hand and actual direct
involvement with victims on the other.2 Although on the basis of identity and other
indicators, double-counting is as far as possible avoided, this cannot entirely be
excluded. This means that the victims recorded by the STV not only represent an
unknown selection as regards character and scale of the total number of victims of
THB in the Netherlands, but also of the number of victims that come into contact with
the police and victim support organisations. The STV, for that matter, comments on
this itself that the victims that are reported to it usually do know one or more women
who are also (possible) victims of THB, but who have not been reported to the STV
(STV 2001; 2002) and that the number of victims reported must at least be doubled to
get a realistic picture.

2.2 Countries/regions of origin

The (possible) victims of THB recorded by the STV, that are or were working in
prostitution in the Netherlands, come from all over the world. The STV records make



4 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

3 Over the years 1992 to 1994 a total of 324 (possible) victims of THB were notified to the STV.
Their number rose from 70 (in 1992) to 166 (in 1994). Data on the countries of origin of the
victims notified to the STV over this period are not included in the present report, but can be
found in the first report (NRM, 2002) and of course in the original source (STV, 2001).

4 Adjusted for the limited contactability, the number of reports in 2001 would, according to the
STV, be comparable with the number of reports in 2000. The provisional figures for 2002
indicate a growth (written information from the STV).  

5 The STV states that both individuals and victims themselves, but also professional groups, in
some cases report THB without giving personal details. This does not, however, explain why
the number of reports of this type increased in 2001.

a distinction by country of origin. Grouping by region (in a single case by country)
gives the summary shown in Table 2.1.

The reduced contactability of the STV in 2001 can be seen in the low number of
victims reported to the STV in that year. For the first time in years there has in fact
been a fall, while other information sources and indicators show no signs of a
reduction in the number of victims of THB in the Netherlands.4 In that year the large
number of reports where the victim’s country of origin is not known is also striking.
There are 70 of them, or a quarter of the total.5 The comments on the STV records

differences reflect the actual developments, that year is largely discussed separately in this
paragraph.

mentioned in the introduction that relate to their reliability and representativeness
thus apply to an even greater extent for the records for 2001.6

The table shows that the number of victims reported differs by region or country of
origin. Over the whole period, Central and Eastern Europe is the region from where
most victims come. The main countries of origin in this region are Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Poland, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Lithuania and Romania. Over the
years, however, the pattern has changed. A fall has been observed in the percentage of
Central and Eastern European victims since 1997, up to 2001. The absolute number of
reports concerning victims from this region, however, did not change appreciably
over the same period. The percentage fall is largely explained by the increase in total
number of reports of victims, partly due to the rise in the number of reports
concerning African, mainly Nigerian, victims. This number rose up to 2001,
particularly after 1996, both in absolute numbers and percentage terms. Over the same
period (1995 to 2001) the number of reports concerning Dutch victims and victims
from Asia also increased – the latter mainly due to an increase in reports concerning
victims from China – but their (percentage) share remained around the same.

The number of reports relating to victims of THB from Latin America (including the
Caribbean) increased steadily over the period from 1995 to 2001 inclusive – with the
exception of 1998 and to a more limited extent 1999. Very small numbers of reports
concern victims from the Middle East and Western Europe.
Perhaps partly due to the large number of unknown countries of origin, 2001 differs in
many respects from the above-mentioned trends. Both the number and also the
percentage of reports relating to victims from Central and Eastern Europe increased
in that year, while the number of reports relating to African victims fell by more than
half in 2001 compared with the year before. Their proportion also fell in percentage
terms, even though the percentage is calculated with respect to just the 165 reports for
which the victims’ countries of origin were known.
The number of reports relating to Dutch victims and victims from Asia also fell in
2001.

Whether as regards victims’ countries of origin the year 2001 heralded all sorts of
trend breaks, or has given a distorted picture due to the comparatively small number
of reports, is expected to become clear in the following annual reviews of the STV.

2.3 Age and sex

No annual reviews have been published of the age distribution of victims reported to
the STV. Table 2.2 therefore only shows the age distribution of the victims reported in
2001.

Source: STV (2002)

The large number of unknown ages in this table is striking: for 42% of the reports the
age of the (possible) victim is not known. The victims whose age is known are in 27
cases minors (that is 16% of the 165 reports where the age is known). The great
majority of the victims fall in the age category from 18 to 30 years (76% of the 165). The
STV does not report on the sex of the victims notified, but only a single case a year
concerns men or boys (verbal and written information from the STV). 

2.4 The reporters

Table 2.3 gives the list of numbers of reports by different categories of reporters in
2001.

7 It is rather confusing in this respect that the STV has classed organisations for Youth care and
guardianship under reception facilities. 

8 These are organisations that provide prostitutes with medical care and information at the
workplace or during special surgeries.

The police are responsible for almost half of the total number of reports. Also quite a
few reports are made anonymously, in the sense that the reporter does not want to
give either his/her name or his/her (professional) background. These reporters, like
the victims themselves, are often reluctant to call in the authorities, out of fear of
deportation or imprisonment (STV, 2002). Reports are also frequently received from
reception facilities. Other reporters are (by decreasing frequency): individuals
(prostitutes, brothel-keepers, clients, friends and partners), Dutch Refugee
Council/asylum centres (staff of reporting centres, reception centres and asylum-
seeker centres), organisations providing youth victim support7 and legal assistance.
The other (categories of) reporters included in the list (such as victim support
organisations, victims themselves, health care institutions and field work8)
occasionally report victims to the STV.

3 The B-9 regulation

3.1 Introduction 

THB is not an offence that can only be prosecuted on the basis of a complaint.
Reporting the offence is therefore not an absolute condition for proceeding with
prosecution. Nevertheless, it is in practice very important for the investigation and
prosecution of THB that both victims and witnesses report THB and that those
reporting an offence remain available to the police and the PPS during investigation
and prosecution. Furthermore, it is important that victims and witnesses of THB are
offered reception and support. The so-called B-9 regulation (section B-9 of the
Immigration Law Circular)1 is designed to open the way for this. Paragraph 3.2 briefly
discusses the main lines of this regulation. The BNRM investigated how many
(possible) victims and witnesses of THB over the period from 1996 to June 2002
inclusive made an appeal for the B-9 regulation according to the records of the
Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and were granted a temporary
residence permit on these grounds. The results of this investigation are described in
the present chapter.

3.2 Description of the B-9 regulation

The B-9 regulation offers aliens who are (possibly) victims of THB, and aliens who are
witnesses of THB, the option to temporarily stay legally in the Netherlands. In order
to give the victim the time to decide whether she wants to report an offence, the victim
is granted a reflection period of a maximum of three months. During these three
months the deportation of the victim from the Netherlands is temporarily suspended.
This reflection period does not apply for witness-informants. If the alien decides not
to report an offence, she must leave the Netherlands immediately. If the victim or the
witness decides to report the offence, this report is regarded as an application to grant
a residence permit. The residence permit is issued for the duration of the investigation
and criminal proceedings and expires when the investigation or the prosecution is
completed or stopped. The B-9 regulation also provides certain facilities for victims
and witnesses of THB (also for victims who are still in the reflection period phase):
reception and shelter, medical assistance, legal assistance and special provisions for
maintenance. 

In principle, when their temporary residence permit under the B-9 regulation (further
referred to for convenience as the B-9 permit) expires, victims of THB can attempt to
have this converted into a permanent residence permit. As grounds for this they may

2 A person may, after all, be involved in several procedures (and for each procedure have several
contacts) with the IND.

3 This is the case for 36 people (6% of the people for whom a B-9 permit was applied for).
4 This is the case for 38 people (8% of the people to whom a B-9 permit was granted).

give humanitarian reasons. BNRM has tried to investigate how many victims of THB
follow this course, however it was not possible to discern this from the present
records of the IND and the STV. According to reports this would only involve
occasional cases.

3.3 Research method

The IND – being the authority to which applications for residence permits under the
B-9 regulation are submitted – has, on the request of BNRM, supplied files containing
all the contacts of people with the IND over the period from 1996 to June 2002
involving the B-9 regulation. The files therefore contain both all the applications for
residence permits and all permits granted under the B-9 regulation. BNRM has
aggregated and combined all the files on a person level2. The result forms the basis for
the analyses in the following paragraphs. 

A few comments on these files are called for. Firstly: the IND does not record
consistently and/or clearly whether applications for and grants of temporary
residence permits are linked with the B-9 regulation. As a result the files may show
that a person who applies for a B-9 permit is granted a temporary residence permit on
completely different grounds (for example ‘living with partner’ or ‘working in EU’).3

The reverse also happens: people who do not apply for a B-9 permit may be granted
one.4 In the analyses it has been assumed that people who are marked either in the
application or in the grant as B-9 had made an appeal for the B-9 regulation. They are
then counted in both categories (applications and grants). Because an appeal for the B-
9 regulation is not recorded by the IND as standard and compulsorily, it is possible
that not all victims that made an appeal for the B-9 regulation have been traced.
Secondly: THB – by the definition of the offence – does not necessarily relate to aliens.
Dutch people or foreigners, residing legally in the Netherlands, may also become
victims of THB. The IND data presented in this paragraph only relate to victims and
witnesses of THB residing illegally in the Netherlands, because only then legalisation
of residence in the Netherlands is necessary for investigation and prosecution.
Thirdly, the IND does not record whether a person is granted a B-9 permit as a victim
or as a witness. Furthermore, a witness may also be a victim. Different sources (e.g.
Van Dijk, 2002) show that victims of THB find it easier to report an offence as a
witness than as a victim. Finally it should again be noted that the IND files analysed
only contain data on people eligible for a temporary residence permit because they
have reported THB. Victims who are still in the reflection period are not recorded by
the IND.

6 It is assumed that the numbers recorded in the first half of 2002 can be approximately doubled

for the whole year.

3.4 Applications for and grants of a B-9 permit

Table 3.1 shows how many people submitted an application for a B-9 permit to the
IND over the period from 1996 to June 2002 inclusive and how often this was granted.
This relates only to ‘first’ applications and grants, so not to applications for and grants
of prolongation of the B-9 permit. Table 3.1 also indicates how big the fall/rise is
compared with the base year 1996 (with indices)5.

2002 (to June inclusive) 114 163  85 185 75%

Total 607 N/A 462 N/A 76%

The number of applications for and grants of B-9 permits fluctuates each year, but has
increased considerably in the last two years.6 In total, over the period from 1996 to
June 2002 inclusive, 607 applications for a B-9 permit were submitted and 462 B-9
permits were granted. This means that in the investigation period for 145 applications
(24%) no permit was granted. There are a number of reasons for this. For example,
applications were withdrawn or expire. This happens for example if the investigation
or the prosecution is not started or is stopped. It also happens that victims/witnesses
who report an offence or make a statement – and appeal for the B-9 regulation –
afterwards ‘disappear’ again. Where they go is usually not known. Possibly victims
return to their country of origin or go back to work in prostitution – self employed or
‘employed’ by traffickers in human beings. 



12 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

7 This was – on the request of BNRM – checked at random by the IND.
8 For 523 of the 607 people this characteristic was known.
9 N=486 and N=37 respectively.
10 For 385 of the 462 people this characteristic was known.
11 N=369 and N=16 respectively.
12 This difference is significant: Chi2=15.9, df=1, p<.01.

For people who made a first application for a B-9 permit it was not always the first
time that they came into contact with the IND. 346 people (57%) had already had
previous contact with the IND, for example in connection with an asylum application
or an arrest (possibly as an illegal alien, for example in case of a control in the
prostitution circuit).7

Anyway, the number of B-9 applications is only a fraction of the total number of
applications for temporary residence permits that the IND receives (and grants) each
year. In 1999 the total number of applications for temporary residence permits was
20,557 and in 2000 13,271. The proportion of applications for B-9 permits out of these
is 5 per mille for both years. The number of temporary residence permits granted in
1999 was 15,703 and in 2000 20,218. The proportion of B-9 permits granted out of
these is respectively 5 and 3 per mille.

3.5 (Background) characteristics of people with (an application for) a B-9
permit

Sex 
Of the victims/witnesses of THB for whom over the period from 1996 to June 2002
inclusive a B-9 permit was applied for and whose sex is known,8 93% were women and
7% men.9 Not all these people were granted a B-9 permit. Among those to whom a B-9
permit was granted and whose sex is known,10 96% are women and 4% men.11 That
means comparatively fewer B-9 permits were granted to men than to women.12 

Age

Two thirds of all victims/witnesses of THB who applied for a B-9 permit, or to whom
one was granted, fall in the age category from 18 to 26 years. Over 10% are minors.
Among the minors who received a B-9 permit, there are also very young children,
namely five aged from 0 to 10 years. Further investigation shows that this age category
very probably includes children of victims or witnesses of THB. Particularly in the
lowest and highest age categories (‘0 to 10 years’ and ‘41 and over’) B-9 permits are
granted comparatively less often than in the middle age categories (respectively 38%
and 44% awards versus 68% to 82% in the age categories between 11 and 40 years).13

16 Chi2=29.5, df=4, p<.01.

The age for the men varies significantly more than for women.14 Men are
comparatively more strongly represented in the lowest and highest age categories and
significantly less strongly in the age category from 18-25 years. This is partly explained
by the fact that there are comparatively more children of victims among the men.
When this is corrected,15 the difference does, however, remain significant.16 A plausible
explanation for this is also that among the men there are comparatively more actual
witnesses of THB. In various surveys the number of adult male victims of THB is in
fact estimated to be low (Van Gelder, 1998; see also NRM, 2002).

One sixth of the victims/witnesses of THB, for whom a B-9 permit has been applied
for, are of Bulgarian nationality. Furthermore, a comparatively large number of
victims/witnesses are of a nationality of other countries from Central and Eastern
Europe or of Nigerian nationality. Although the top 10 of the commonest nationalities
for both people to whom a B-9 permit was granted and to whom a B-9 permit was not
granted is the same, there are however significant differences between the
victims/witnesses of different nationalities where this relates to the percentage of
applications that results in a permit being granted.17 Of the nationalities mentioned in
Table 3.4 the percentage of people whose applications are honoured is the highest for
Bulgaria (94%) Moldavia (92%) and Slovakia (92%) and the lowest for Lithuanians
(63%).18 

Table 3.5 breaks down the nationalities of the victims/witnesses with a B-9 permit
(application) by region of origin. Central and Eastern Europe is broken down here
into Central Europe (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary), Eastern
Europe (the former Soviet Union), the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and
the Balkans (countries from the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania,
Moldavia). The Netherlands has special relations on the one hand with Surinam,
Indonesia and the Dutch Antilles, because they are former colonies, and on the other
hand with Turkey and Morocco, because these are the countries where in the past
many guest workers were recruited. Only a few victims/witnesses with B-9 permits
originate from these five countries.19 Table 3.5 therefore classifies victims/witnesses of
Surinam or Antillian nationality in the category ‘Latin America and Caribbean’,
victims/ witnesses of Turkish nationality in the category Eastern Europe,
victims/witnesses of Moroccan nationality in the category ‘Africa’ and
victims/witnesses of Indonesian nationality in the category ‘Asia’.

Victims/witnesses who make use of the B-9 regulation come comparatively frequently
from the Balkans. Eastern and Central Europe and Africa also score high. The
percentage of applications honoured differs significantly by region.21 A B-9 permit is
granted comparatively most often (83%) to people from the Balkans and comparatively
least often to people from Asia and Western Europe (60% and 53% respectively).22

As previously stated these data include a selection, namely of victims and witnesses,
who report an offence or make a statement. The origin of this group therefore does
not have to reflect the origin of all victims of THB. To gain more understanding of the
similarities and differences, a check was made as to what extent the areas of origin as
presented in Table 3.5 correspond with the areas of origin of victims that are recorded
by the STV. The result is shown in Table 3.6.23 This table compares the areas of origin
for the year 2001, being the most recent ‘full’ record year. The Netherlands is not taken
into account as a country of origin, because Dutch victims of THB may be reported to
the STV, but do not need a residence permit and do not therefore come into contact
with the IND. The analyses only include the victims(/witnesses) whose country of
origin is known. As a result, of the STV figures 70 people (25%) are left out of account,
and 3 (2%) of the IND figures.

24 Including reports where the country of origin is the Netherlands or unknown, this column
totals 284.

25 The differences in Table 3.5 are therefore not significant.

The distribution of victims of THB by area of origin is more or less the same for 2001
for the IND and STV records.25 The most important area of origin in both sets of
records is Central and Eastern Europe. Within this area both in the STV and the IND
figures Bulgaria, the Russian Federation and Ukraine are the three commonest
countries of origin. In second place is Africa, with Nigeria as the most common
country of origin in both sets of records.

Per year the number of B-9 permits granted per region of origin fluctuates
considerably and significantly.26 Striking in particular is the increase in
victims/witnesses from the Balkans in the last two years. Furthermore, the reduction
in victims/witnesses from Central and Eastern Europe in the last year of the
investigation is striking, even if these annual figures are doubled (the data for 2002 do
in fact relate to the period from January to June inclusive).

we also talk of suspects ‘sent in'.

4 Police investigation into trafficking in human beings

4.1 Introduction

For an adequate approach to THB, knowledge regarding perpetrators, victims and
modus operandi (the method of operation of the perpetrators) is vital. For this reason
the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NRI) of the National Police Services
Agency (KLPD), on behalf of the Board of Police Commissioners, has carried out a
research into THB in the Netherlands. The results are published in the report
‘Mensenhandel in Nederland 1997-2000’ (THB in the Netherlands 1997-2000) (Van Dijk,
2002). The NRM collected police data regarding THB for the year 2001. The results of
this follow-up research are presented in this chapter. The results from the NRI
research are also included in this. Firstly, because the numerical data from the NRI
research have been analysed again together with the data for 2001, so that any
developments and trends over time can be identified. Secondly, by repeating relevant
information and conclusions regarding THB from that report in this chapter. 

4.2 Research method

The research method used for the reference year 2001 is a virtually exact copy of the
research method as used in the NRI investigation for the reference year 2000. 

Research design
In June 2002 all the police authorities who (can) carry out investigations into THB
were approached. They were asked to report to the researchers all the investigations
into THB completed in 2001 and sent in to the PPS (that is, one or more suspects were
‘sent in’ to the PPS)1. From the completed investigations thus collected, a few essential
key data regarding the THB on which the investigation focussed were then collected
by means of telephone interviews with the team leaders of these investigations. This
method was chosen in order to collect information quickly and efficiently. In the
interviews the same questionnaire was used as the NRI used for the reference year
2000, supplemented with a few questions, prompted by developments and relevance.2



22 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

3 There are no cases where no offence is reported for the investigation period 1997-2000.
Practice does, however, show that cases where no offence is reported are rarely completed and
sent in (Van Dijk, 2002).

4 The adjustment of the criterion had no noticeable consequences on the combination of the
results for 2001 with the NRI results of Van Dijk (2002).

For the NRI research both completed and discontinued investigations into THB over
the period 1997-2000 and those still underway were surveyed. For 2001 it was decided
only to survey and analyse investigations that had been completed and sent in to the
PPS. This means that investigations into THB for which the victims have not reported
the offence can be included in the analyses.3 This approach was also prompted by the
intention of the NRM to also collect these police data for following years. By using the
submission date as the end date of the investigation, it is clear which investigation
must be reported to the researchers in which year.4 The choice does mean that when
interpreting the results one must keep in mind that the start year of the investigations
may differ. 

Generalisability of the information
The investigations analysed do concern all the investigations into THB completed and
sent in, but must be regarded as an unknown random sample of the total number of
THB offences in the Netherlands. After all, more offences are committed than come to
the knowledge of the police and not all investigations are brought to a positive end (or
sent in to the PPS). In other words: the investigations only represent part of the reality.
It is not known how great or representative this part is. 

4.3 Police investigations into trafficking in human beings in 1997-2001

Number and type of completed investigations
Table 4.1 gives a summary of the investigations completed by the police in the period
1997-2001 and sent in to the PPS, broken down by the year in which the investigation
was completed. An indication is always given of how big the fall/rise is with respect to
the base year 1997 (with indices). This table also breaks down the results by the type of
THB: cross-border or within the Netherlands. In the case of cross-border THB victims
are recruited abroad. In the case of THB within the Netherlands victims are recruited
in the Netherlands. One of the cases investigated involved a combination of both. This
involved an investigation by a police region bordering Belgium, where recruitment
was carried out mainly in the Netherlands, but occasionally also in Belgium. This
investigation was classified as THB within the Netherlands.

5 The percentage of investigations into THB within the Netherlands (with respect to all
investigations) per year is respectively 25% (1997), 14% (1998), 38% (1999), 32% (2000) and 25%
(2001).

6 For 2000 these data were not collected. The question was added back into the questionnaire
for 2001 after its relevance was ascertained.

The number of investigations into THB completed by the police increased
considerably, particularly in 2001. In that year 48 investigations were completed and
sent in to the PPS. This increase had already started in 2000, when the number of
investigations completed was already higher than in previous years. Of the completed
investigations in 1997-2001 27% (30) related to THB within the Netherlands and 73%
(81) to cross-border THB. These percentages differ from year to year.5 In 1998 the
proportion of investigations into THB within the Netherlands was the lowest (14%)
and in 1999 the highest (38%). 

Immediate cause for the investigation
For the period 1997-1999 and 2001, the immediate cause for the investigations into
THB was studied.6 The result – also per year – is shown in Table 4.2. The ‘initial’ cause
for the investigation was looked for. For example, in virtually all the investigations
completed victim(s) reported an offence at a given time. In the table below, however,
reporting an offence is only given as a cause if the victims themselves – possibly with
the help of third parties – went to the police to report an offence. If, on the other hand,
regular controls by the police in the prostitution sector lead to the discovery of
possible victims of THB, who later report an offence, the cause given is a prostitution
control. Furthermore, investigations are started on the basis of information from the
National Criminal Intelligence Service (CIE), tips and (residual) information from
other investigations. The latter is for example the case if an investigation already
started is taken over by another police region or if in an investigation (other) suspects
emerge who justify an independent investigation.

A ‘spontaneous’ report was the cause for the investigation in almost half of the cases.
Furthermore, controls in the prostitution sector lead to investigations comparatively
often. The ‘other’ category often relates to incidents in a prostitution environment
that necessitates police intervention (for example fights or assault).

Duration of police investigation
The number of months that the investigations into THB analysed took was checked.
The result is shown in Table 4.3, broken down by the year in which the investigation
ended.

investigation into THB takes 6 months.8 The average duration of the investigation did
not change significantly over time.9 The time that a police investigation into THB
takes depends on a number of factors. For example in the investigation by Van Dijk
(2002) a strong relationship was found with the number of suspects on which the
investigation focuses: the more suspects, the longer the investigation takes. On the
other hand, investigations into cross-border THB did not take significantly longer
than investigations into THB within the Netherlands. This is, because the ‘foreign’
part of the criminal group is rarely investigated and traced.

4.4 Suspects of trafficking in human beings

Table 4.4 presents the number of suspects of THB distinguished and arrested as well
as the number of suspects that were ‘sent in’ to the PPS, broken down by the year in

was investigated. This shows that 20% of these suspects could not be found, and had
probably gone abroad. For some of these suspects an international tracing warrant
had been issued. For 72% of the ‘lost’ suspects police charges were dropped, because of
the marginal role that the suspect played or because of lack of evidence. Almost half of
these suspects themselves worked as prostitutes. Also a number of these suspects
were residing illegally in the Netherlands. They were deported. 8% of the ‘lost’ suspects
were ‘transferred’ to another police investigation11 or would possibly be arrested
and/or ‘sent in’ at a later date.12 The number of suspects increased considerably
particularly in the last two years investigated.
Table 4.5 presents the average number of suspects per investigation for the years
investigated. A corresponding table with standard deviations is included in Annex 2
(Table 2).

The average number of suspects distinguished, arrested and ‘sent in’ per investigation
fell in the last year. The comparatively low average number of suspects per
investigation – while, as discussed later in this paragraph, THB is often carried out by
perpetrators who belong to extensive criminal networks – is partly explained by the
fact that the number of suspects distinguished in an investigation partly depends on
the extent to which the police take the trouble to trace the whole criminal (suspects)
group. In most investigations, however, priority is given to tracing and prosecuting
suspects residing and/or operating in the Netherlands (Van Dijk, 2002). Suspects who
are not or rarely in the Netherlands (usually recruiters and intermediaries), are as a
result left out of account in many investigations. This paragraph reports further on
suspects arrested.

14 The percentage of women among the suspects from 1997-2001 is respectively 32%, 16%, 18%,

29% and 29%.

Sex
A quarter of the suspects arrested (26%) are female.13 The number of women among
the suspects has increased comparatively in the last two years.14 Of the female suspects
some were themselves victims of THB (Van Dijk, 2002). 

Origin
Table 4.6 shows the countries of origin of the suspects arrested. This table only
includes the commonest countries of origin. A table giving all the countries of origin
of the suspects is included in Annex 2 (Table 3). In addition to the nationality and the
country of birth, Table 4.6 also shows the ‘origin’ of the suspects. For this last
characteristic the background characteristics ‘nationality’ and ‘country of birth’ are
combined as follows: if the nationality is non-Dutch or the country of birth is not the
Netherlands, the suspect is classified as non-Netherlands country of origin. For that
matter, the origin of the suspects thus obtained virtually corresponds to the countries
of birth table.

15 Looking at the ‘origin’ of the suspects.

Almost half of the suspects are of Dutch nationality. Some of them were, however,
born outside the Netherlands. Furthermore, a comparatively large number of suspects
come from (former) Yugoslavia and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria, Turkey, Albania and
Bulgaria. Further analyses show that suspects of cross-border THB come
comparatively just as often from the Netherlands as suspects of THB within the
Netherlands.15 Suspects with a foreign background from the last group do, however,
come more frequently from Morocco, while suspects from the first group come more
often from former Yugoslavia, Nigeria and a variety of other countries.
Table 4.7 breaks down the nationality of the suspects by the year in which the
investigation was completed.

In the last year studied the number of suspects of Dutch nationality increased, also
comparatively. Furthermore, the nationality of the suspects varies from year to year,
whereby there seems to be no question of a clear trend.

Residence status 
For suspects of non-Dutch nationality for the years 2000 and 2001, their residence
status was checked. This shows that 57% of the suspects reside legally in the
Netherlands on the basis of a residence permit (usually based on living with a partner,



4 police investigation into trafficking in human beings 29

16 23% of these suspects are asylum-seekers. 77% have a residence permit on other grounds, for
which a precise further breakdown based on the data collected is not possible. It is, however,
clear that in virtually all further cases this involves a residence permit based on living with a
partner. 

17 The latter group then comes from countries with no visa obligation (for example the European
Union or a few applicant-member states of the European Union). They can stay in the
Netherlands for 3 to 6 months, depending on the country of origin, without a visa.
Nevertheless, the free period expires on committing a criminal act. The perpetrator is then
residing in the Netherlands illegally.

sometimes based on an asylum application)16 and 10% reside legally in the Netherlands
on the basis of a visa or because they are travelling in the so-called ‘free period’.17 18 33%
of the suspects of non-Dutch nationality reside illegally in the Netherlands. Among
these illegals there are also suspects from countries with no visa obligation. Their
residence has, however, become illegal because they have exceeded the ‘free period’. In
2001 the number of suspects with a residence permit fell from 66% to 36% and the
number of suspects residing illegally in the Netherlands rose from 10% to 42%. 

Visa obligation
A check was made as to what extent suspects of non-Dutch nationality come from
countries for which there is no (longer a) visa obligation (for example member states
and some of the applicant states of the EU. For this a check was made for each
investigation as to how many suspects on the start date of the investigation were of a
nationality of a country with or without a visa obligation. The link to the start date of
the investigation is particularly important for countries for which the visa obligation
was lifted during the investigation period (1997-2001), namely Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania (1-7-1999), Bulgaria (10-4-2001) and Romania (1-1-2002). The result of this
exercise is shown in Table 4.8.

30 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

19 This is the total of suspects from Central and Eastern Europe with no visa obligation (12%) and
suspects from other countries with no visa obligation (10%).

20 After all, it is not known whether they obtained the residence permit before or after an (il)legal
residence in the Netherlands. 

21 The survey group is suspects of THB in 2000 and 2001, with a foreign nationality, not having a
residence permit. This group consists of 44 persons.

22 The percentage of operators among the suspects is 15% (1997), 5% (1998), 11% (1999), 8% (2000)
and 12% (2001) respectively.

23 When one partner is a helper with a marginal role, the ‘partnership’ is categorised as a ‘soloist’.

The percentage of suspects arrested that – based on their nationality – had no visa
obligation at the time that the investigation started, is 22%.19 This percentage varies
from year to year, but seems to have increased slightly in the last investigation year.
Further analyses show this can be attributed to a comparatively greater influx of
suspects from countries in Central and Eastern Europe with no visa obligation in that
year. The percentage of suspects from these countries was in the years 1998 to 2000
inclusive in fact 7% to 8% and in 2001 17%. These results may also be affected by factors
other than whether or not there is a visa obligation. In addition, no account is taken of
the fact that a number of suspects hold a residence permit. If this last group is left out
of account20 – this may only be done for the years 2000 and 2001, because these data
are missing for previous years – then it appears that 19 suspects (43%) upon their arrest
came from a country with no visa obligation and 25 suspects (57%) from a country with
a visa obligation.21 From the results taken together it is not then possible to directly
deduce a disproportionate absence or considerable increase in the number of suspects
from countries with no visa obligation.

Operators of sex establishments
Of the 508 suspects arrested 50 (10%) are operators of – mainly – clubs and brothels.
This number did in fact increase per investigation year from five operators in 1997 to
22 operators in 2001, but the percentage of operators out of the total number of
suspects in the relevant years fluctuates somewhat.22 Many of the operators arrested
(38, 76%) were ‘sent in’ to the PPS. 

Type of partnership
With regard to THB three forms of criminal organisation can be distinguished (Van
Dijk, 2002). 
Firstly, the soloist: one person has one or more girls working for him or her. This is for
example often the case for ‘loverboy’ businesses and other forms of THB within the
Netherlands, even where victims are also brought in from abroad. Although many
‘pimps’ do know each other and also consult one another, these are ‘one-man
businesses’. The pimp is sometimes assisted by a ‘helper’ who has a very marginal role,
for example keeping an eye on the victim when the pimp is not present.
Secondly, the isolated criminal group. This is a group of at least two members, each
having a serious part in the THB,23 and maximum 5 members, responsible for the
whole THB process – from recruitment to putting victims into prostitution – and has



4 police investigation into trafficking in human beings 31

24 48%, 52%, 0% (1997); 96%, 0%, 4% (1998); 75%, 16%, 8% (1999); 76%, 16%, 7% (2000) and 75%, 13%,
11% (2001) respectively.

no demonstrable contact with other groups or persons who are involved in THB. In
the case of cross-border THB, the members of the group fetch the victims from
abroad themselves – for example via a family member of the chief suspect or their
partner, who lives abroad. The main suspects often run a brothel themselves. 
Thirdly, the criminal networks. At least six, but usually many more persons are
involved. These groups often meet the description of criminal macro-networks, as set
out in the investigation of Klerks (2000, p. 75): “In this undifferentiated criminal
infrastructure in principle everyone is associated with everyone else via one or more
intermediaries. There are also clear clusters based on geographic closeness, family
links, friendships, commercial chains and interrelated activities”. In the case of THB
clusters arise around the recruitment in specific countries, the transport to the
Netherlands and the prostitution of victims in one of more countries/towns. Victims
are bought and sold on and often recruited and/or ‘employed’ in several countries.
Over the period 1997-2001 27 ‘soloists’ were traced, 22 ‘isolated groups’ and 65 –
virtually always branches of – ‘criminal networks’. Table 4.9 shows per year the forms
of organisation traced.

Total 8 100% 14 100% 16 100% 25 100% 48 100% 111 100%

Three fifths of the investigations focused on (branches of) criminal networks, one fifth
on isolated groups and a further one fifth on soloists. The type of partnership, on
which the investigations focused, did change somewhat comparatively over the years,
but in virtually every year the majority of the investigations focused on criminal
networks. Further analyses show that in the total investigation period 77% of the
suspects arrested belong to a network, 15% to an isolated group and 8% are soloists.
This ratio was found particularly in the last investigation years (from 1999).24 Of the
soloists the majority (79%) are involved in THB within the Netherlands and of the
isolated groups 41%. All the criminal networks are involved in cross-border THB.



32 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

25 Adopted at a meeting of the Council of Europe in December 1994. For a description of the
criteria is referred to Van Dijk (2002).

Organised crime?
THB, certainly cross-border THB, requires a certain form of organisation. The
question is, however, to what extent the criminal groups committing THB in the
present research, can be classed as ‘organised crime’. Van Dijk (2002) verified this by
checking out the THB cases she studied against the definitions of and criteria for
organised crime used by Fijnaut (1996), the Council of Europe25 and Klerks (2000).
According to these criteria the percentage of investigations that can be regarded as
investigation into organised crime differ considerably.
Van Dijk found that criminal groups involved in THB operate fairly traditionally. They
try more to evade the upper world, than to infiltrate it or go after economic or political
power. Also, when carrying out the offence they show themselves to be conservative
‘entrepreneurs’. Few new tricks, techniques or strategies, but rather walking known
paths that have proved successful. Also – inherent in the offence – traffickers in
human beings have a large operating area, from a geographic point of view. They often
belong to extensive and widely branched networks. Many criminal groups are
characterised by violence, usually against victims, but also against other group
members and competitors. The most serious defensive contra-strategy that the
criminal groups use consists of threatening victims who want to report an offence.
Other commonly used measures to prevent or counteract being traced include using
false and/or alternating identities for perpetrators and victims and frequently moving
victims through the Netherlands and Europe. 

4.5 Modus operandi of traffickers in human beings

4.5.1 Recruitment and countries of origin

The THB process begins with the recruitment of victims, in the Netherlands or
abroad. Table 4.10 shows the countries where the victims in the investigations
analysed were recruited. This table only shows the countries where was recruited
comparatively frequently. A full list of all the recruitment countries is included in
Annex 2 (Table 4). Because traffickers in human beings may recruit in several
countries, the table does not add up to 100%.

In almost a third of the investigations the cases involve recruitment in the
Netherlands. Comparatively often also is recruited in Nigeria, the Czech Republic,
Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Russian Federation. Comparatively the number of
investigations in which victims were recruited in Moldavia, Bulgaria and the Russian
Federation increased last year. Victims are often recruited in a number of countries.
For this reason Table 4.11 classes the countries of origin of the foreign victims by
region of origin. As recruitment is often carried out in Central and Eastern Europe,
this region is broken down into Central Europe (Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Hungary), Eastern Europe (the former Soviet Union), the Baltic states
(Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and the Balkans (countries from former Yugoslavia,
Romania, Bulgaria, Albania). As traffickers in human beings may recruit in several
regions, the table does not add up to 100%.

Victims are recruited comparatively often in Central Europe, closely followed by
Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In addition Africa ‘scores’ high: in one sixth of the
investigations (also) there is recruited. The percentage of victims per region of
recruitment fluctuates from year to year. The regions of origin among these victims
virtually correspond with the regions of origin as recorded by the STV and the regions
of origin of victims and witnesses of THB who make use of the B-9 regulation (see
Table 3.6).28

Recruitment in countries with no visa obligation?
It is conceivable that the choice of recruitment countries is related to the fact of
whether victims from a country are obliged to have a visa or not. A check was
therefore made as to what extent – when is recruited abroad – recruitment is carried
out in countries with and with no visa obligation. For this the visa status of the
recruitment countries at the start of the investigation was assumed. The result is
shown in Table 4.12. This table distinguishes between investigations for which
recruitment is carried out in countries with a visa obligation, countries with no visa
obligation and both. Table 4.12 also breaks down the data by year.

In over a fifth of all the cases investigated, in which victims are recruited abroad,
recruitment is only carried out in countries without a visa obligation and in two fifths
in both countries with and without a visa obligation. Also in two fifths of the
investigations recruitment is only carried out in countries with a visa obligation. The
percentage of investigations in which recruitment is only or also carried out in
countries without a visa obligation remained virtually constant in recent years, namely
around 60%.29

These data say nothing directly about the number of victims that are recruited in
countries with and without a visa obligation; in the one case more victims are
recruited/bought than in other cases. For some countries of origin the visa obligation
was abolished during the investigation period. In the present research 28
investigations are surveyed where victims were recruited in (among other things) one
of these countries. Fourteen of these investigations (50%) were started before the visa
obligation was abolished and also 14 investigations (50%) after the visa obligation was
abolished. It therefore seems that whether or not a visa obligation exists does not play
a direct part in the choice of recruitment in a particular country. 

4.5.2 Travel route and travel and residence documents

Travel route and border crossing
Travel routes to the Netherlands, in the case of cross-border THB, vary considerably,
on the one hand due to the differences in countries of origin, but also because criminal
groups are always trying out new travel routes (Van Dijk, 2002). From the continents
of Africa, America and Asia victims always come by plane, but not always flying
directly to the Netherlands. From Central and Eastern Europe the journey is usually
entirely over land. Table 4.13 shows per year where the border with the Netherlands



36 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

was crossed.30 Because the border crossing within one investigation may be made in
several ways, the table does not add up to 100%.

In two thirds of the investigations it emerged that victims are (also) brought to the
Netherlands over land via Germany, in one third (also) over land via Belgium. Almost
one fifth of the investigations show that victims (also) enter the Netherlands via
Schiphol.

Travel documents
Table 4.14 shows for all the investigations involving cross-border THB to what extent
the victims32 are in possession of a (valid, false or forged) passport. Because within one
investigation different victims may carry different identity documents, the table does
not add up to 100%.

34 Investigations in which the latter was the case, are included in the ‘forged/false passports’.
35 N=90. Because in an investigation different victims may carry a number of visas with them, the

percentages do not add up to 100%.
36 Corresponding numbers: valid visa (2000: 9; 2001: 8), forged/false visa (2000: 1; 2001: 3), no

visa (2000: 2; 2001: 15).
37 9% in 2000 and 13% in 2001. N=23 (2000) and 45 (2001) respectively.

In almost two thirds of the investigations into cross-border THB, one or more victims
emerge that have a forged or false passport. Van Dijk (2002) found that the
falsification of passports is often carried out by separate criminal groups. For a false
passport, according to the data available in the research, one has to pay out € 300 to 
€ 500. African traffickers in human beings use a lot of valid passports that are used by
a number of victims of similar appearance (‘look-a-likes’).34

A check has been made as to whether victims recruited in countries with a visa
obligation are in possession of a visa upon arrest/reporting and, if so, what. This
shows that visas are forged or copied comparatively much less than passports (in 13%
of the cases investigated). Usually a visa is applied for (in 53% of cases) or people travel
without a visa (in 40% of cases).35 It is only possible to break down these data by year to
a limited extent, because in particular for many investigations completed in the years
1997 to 1999 these data are missing. For this reason these data are only given for the
years 2000 and 2001: the percentage of investigations where people travel with a valid
visa fell from 73% in 2000 to 35% in 2001. The percentage of investigations where
people travelled without a visa from a country for which a visa was compulsory
increased on the other hand from 18% in 2000 to 61% in 2001.36 The percentage of
investigations where a forged or false visa was used remained more or less the same.37

4.5.3 Exploitation in prostitution

Traffickers in human beings use many means of coercion to bring or keep people in
prostitution and/or to confiscate their earnings. It was examined how the victims are
brought to prostitute themselves and/or how a situation may arise in which they
(must) hand over all their money. The result is shown in Table 4.15. This table breaks
down the means of coercion used by the year in which the investigation was
completed. Because traffickers in human beings may use several means of coercion,
the table does not add up to 100%.

Victims of THB are very often threatened with violence to force them to (continue to)
work in prostitution for the trafficker in human beings and/or to hand over the money
they have earned. According to many investigations the suspects also often actually
use violence against the victims. In addition, victims are according to many
investigations locked up or constantly watched . Taking away passports and imposing
(fictitious) debts occurs mainly in the case of cross-border THB.39 In the case of THB
within the Netherlands, more often than for cross-border THB, victims are incited to
prostitution with carefully planned, ‘played out’ love techniques.40 Victims from
Nigeria and Malawi also report voodoo practices. It is not possible to discern clear
developments over time: the means of coercion used vary from year to year.

Mobility
A characteristic of THB is that victims are set to work in different places within and
outside the Netherlands. Firstly to meet the demand for ‘always new girls’ in the
prostitution world. Secondly to prevent tracing by the police and to prevent victims
making social contact (Van Dijk, 2002). Table 4.16 shows in which countries, outside
the Netherlands and outside the country of origin, the victims have worked in
prostitution. This table only mentions the commonest countries. The results are also
given by investigation year.

In half of the investigations it emerges that victims have also been put into prostitution
elsewhere in Europe or outside it. In addition, the victims are sold (on), sometimes
even several times (Van Dijk, 2002). This percentage remained fairly stable in recent
years. Victims who are put into prostitution outside the Netherlands and outside the
country of origin end up most often (also) in Germany. Other countries that ‘score’
comparatively high are Belgium, Italy and Spain. The top 4 most common destination
countries outside the Netherlands, remained the same from 1999. 

Victims of cross-border THB are more often brought into prostitution outside the
Netherlands (and the country of origin) than victims of THB within the Netherlands:
58% against 23%. In the case of THB within the Netherlands this virtually always
involves prostitution in the neighbouring countries Germany and Belgium, while

in the sector, this is probably an underestimate.

victims of cross-border THB are (also) put to work in countries other than these –
both within and outside the EU.

Two thirds of all investigations (67%) concern cases where victims – where known –
are (also) employed in different towns in the Netherlands.42

4.6 Prostitution sectors involved

In a THB case different prostitution sectors may be involved, such as window
prostitution, clubs/brothels/private houses, the escort sector and street prostitution.
Table 4.17 shows which prostitution sectors were involved in the THB cases
investigated, broken down by the year in which the investigation was completed.
Because an investigation may relate to several sectors, the percentages do not add up
to 100%.

Table 4.17 Prostitution sectors involved, broken down by year43

Street prostitution - - 2 14% 2 13% 5 20% 7 15% 16 14%

In well over half of the investigations it emerges that victims are (also) employed in
window prostitution, and in well over half (also) in clubs/brothels. Comparatively
fewer investigations focused on the escort sector and/or street prostitution. In 2001
the number of investigations focused on the escort sector did however increase
comparatively, after a low point in 2000. 
Van Dijk (2002) studied for the period 1997-1999 to what extent the prostitution
sector was involved in THB, that means to what extent operators of sex
establishments were guilty of criminal acts relating to THB or knew of these.
According to a quarter of the investigations operators were aware of the exploitation
situation in which the victims found themselves, but were not actively involved in this.
Also in a quarter of the investigations the operators were regarded as traffickers in
human beings, that means that they played an active part in (parts of) the THB

process, such as the recruitment and trade of victims or placing/holding victims in
prostitution by force. For 2000 and 2001 this fact was not investigated. For 2002
questions about this will come up again in the questionnaire.

4.7 Victims of trafficking in human beings

Number and type of victims
In the investigations completed in the period 1997 to 2001 inclusive in total 471 victims
made a statement. Table 4.18 presents the number of victims that made a statement,
and for whom this led to an investigation sent in to the PPS. These data are also
broken down by year and type of THB (cross-border and within the Netherlands).

The number of statements in investigations completed increased particularly in the
last investigation year, like the number of investigations completed in that year. The
average number of statements per investigation hardly changed, with the exception of
a peak in 1998. This peak is caused by one investigation with many reports of offences. 

Table 4.19 presents the number of and percentage of investigations involving one or
more underage victims, broken down by the year in which the investigations were
completed and by type of THB.

In total two fifths of the investigations (41%) (partly) related to underage victims. This
percentage fluctuates per year. How many underage victims are involved in these
investigations was not researched. Van Dijk (2002) did do this for the period 1997-
1999. This was 26, that is 17% of the total number of victims that reported THB in this
period and for which the investigation was completed and sent in. The number of
underage victims seems to be significantly greater in the case of THB within the
Netherlands than in the case of cross-border THB.

In the whole research period only one investigation into THB involved male victims.
This case is described in by Van Dijk (2002).

4.8 Proceeds of trafficking in human beings

During or after an investigation into THB a decision may be made to try to confiscate
the gain acquired illegally by the perpetrators. To do this – as established in the ‘Plukze
Act47 – a criminal financial investigation (CFI) is carried out. Table 4.20 shows how
often in the investigations into THB a CFI was opened and how often this has led to a
confiscation order. Data regarding the confiscation orders instituted have, however,
only been collected for 2000 and 2001. In 4 of the 111 cases investigated, consideration
was still being given to whether a CFI would be opened. These cases are not included
in Table 4.20.

€ 79,545; 2000: €  104,953; 2001: € 210,999.
50 In some cases income was also generated from criminal activities other than THB. When that

is the case, an attempt was made to separate the proceeds of THB from other sources. The
proceeds mentioned in the table then only relate to THB.

* Percentage of the total number of investigations in the relevant year
** Percentage of the number of CFIs in the relevant year(s). The total percentage of the confiscation orders
is calculated over the 23 CFIs in 2000 and 2001

In one third of the investigations into THB a CFI was opened. This percentage
remained virtually constant in the last investigation years. The percentage of
investigations for which the CFI results in a confiscation order was higher in 2001
than in 2000, namely 93% (against 63% in 2000). In its first report BNRM checked on
how many of the cases registered with the PPS (~suspects) in the period 1995 to the
first half of 2000, in which a summons was issued, led to a confiscation order. This
was found to apply in 18% of cases. It is stated that this does not at first sight seem very
often, but that information from PPS data shows that this happened in the same
period regarding infringement of the Opium Act in no more than 11% of cases.

The illegally acquired gain in the 24 cases in the period 1997-2001 for which this is
known,48 taking everything together, rounds up to almost € 5,000,000. On average,
this rounds up to € 200,000 per case and € 150,000 per suspect. The average illegally
acquired gain per suspect varies considerably per investigation year and was the
highest in 2001 at € 210,000 in round figures.49

Because the illegally acquired gain is not calculated in every case, the police officials
interviewed were asked to estimate how much the suspects have earned in total from
THB. This was done in the light of possessions found and distinguished, lifestyle of
the suspect(s), number of victims that they ran and the period that the victims were
exploited in prostitution. In this way the proceeds were estimated for virtually all the
cases investigated. The result is shown in Table 4.21.50

Half of the investigations involve cases where more than € 45,000 is earned by THB.
This fluctuates little per year.

Van Dijk (2002) estimated the total proceeds of THB, by starting from the number of
months that the estimated 3,500 victims of THB (see paragraph 4.7) worked in
prostitution in 2000, at € 118,000,000. Another possibility is to estimate the annual
proceeds of THB by multiplying the number of estimated victims in that year by the
average gross annual earnings of a prostitute in the Netherlands.51 Calculated in this
way, in 2000 THB yielded a rounded gross amount of € 85,000,000. On the one hand,
payments to operators of sex establishments and victims still have to be deducted
from this (after all, in one third of cases according to Van Dijk something is paid to the
victims out of the money they have earned) and not all victims work a whole year in
prostitution. On the other hand, victims of THB probably earn more than the ‘average’
prostitute, because they are often forced to work many long days. The amount
mentioned must therefore be seen as a rough indication of the amount that is earned
from THB.

Damage claim victims 
A check was made as to how many victims have tried via civil law proceedings or via a
‘civil joinder in the criminal proceedings’ to get back (some of) the money they have
earned. This is found to be the case – as far as is known – in 16 cases (14%). Of these, 10
cases were completed in the last year of the research.52 The percentage of victims that
submit a claim remains roughly the same in 2001 as in previous years.53 The extent of
the amounts demanded and awarded is usually not known to the police.

4.9 Criminal activities other than trafficking in human beings

A check was made as to whether the suspects in the studied investigations also carry
out other criminal activities. The result is shown in Table 4.22. This table does not take
into account activities committed to support THB, such as committing violence, rape,
unlawful detention, falsification of or fraud with travel and residence documents.
Because traffickers in human beings may carry out several criminal activities, the table
does not add up to 100%.

In around half of the THB cases investigated, the suspects are also suspected of
offences other than THB. This percentage is higher in the last year of the research
(2001) than in previous years. High scoring secondary criminal activities are crimes
against property and narcotics related crimes. A number of suspects are also involved
in weapons related crimes. These are comparatively often suspects of (former)
Yugoslav nationality (Van Dijk, 2002). In 2001 the number of investigations in which
THB was combined with crimes against property increased considerably compared
with 2000.





1 The analyses were, on the request of BNRM, made by the Statistics and Policy Analysis
department (Siba) of the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) of the
Ministry of Justice. Reference date 1 June 2002.

2 This includes cases dropped at a later stage of the proceedings by the PPS and cases in which
ultimately no suspicion of THB is included in the charges.

5 Prosecution

5.1 Introduction

This chapter contains information on THB cases registered with the PPS. 

 
5.2 Research method 

To get an idea of the (progress of) criminal proceeding of THB cases, analyses were
carried out on the national database of PPS data.1 With the help of PPS data it is
possible to get an idea of the progress of cases in the first instance. There are no data
on a possible appeal phase. PPS data contain details of cases and offences. Unlike in
the preceding chapter on police investigation, a (criminal) case is understood here to
mean the case against one suspect. Furthermore, it involves exclusively the offences for
which principle charges are brought: offences for which alternative charges are
brought are not included in PPS data. It also emerges that where principle charges are
brought for several offences, only the first offence is recorded in PPS data. 

5.3 Trafficking in human beings cases registered with the Public Prosecution
Service

Over the period from 1995 to 2001 inclusive 892 criminal cases were registered with
the PPS involving (only or partly) a suspicion of THB.2 

Table 5.1 indicates how many cases this involves per year and how many of these cases
(partly) relate to underage victims.



48 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

3 These are – as in the first report – all cases, including cases transferred (to another district).
These are in total nine, varying in number per year from none to four (in 1997).

4 These are in 2000 respectively four and two more than indicated in the first report for that
year. These relate to cases received afterwards. The information on these cases is incorporated
in the above and following tables.

5 Provisional data for 2002 (source: printout of the National Office of the PPS, reference date 1
November 2002) make it clear that for that year a considerable growth in the total number of
cases registered with the PPS relating to suspicion of THB can be expected.

6 For this, the same categories are used as in the first report, namely: 1) Only (a form of) THB (art.
250ter or 250a Penal Code); 2) THB in combination with participation in a criminal organisation
(art. 140 Penal Code); 3) THB in combination with certain forms of violence. Counted here are
forms of both physical and mental violence, such as intentional unlawful detention, taking of
hostages, kidnapping and abduction, rape, mistreatment, manslaughter and murder; 4) THB
combined with forms of fraud and racketing, such as false passport, document forgery and
bigamy; 5) THB combined with offences specifically against children (with the exception of THB
with minors as victims), such as intercourse with children under 16 years of age, using or
offering young people for pornography and inciting minors to vice. Looked at in retrospect
categories 3 and 5 are unfortunately not clearly enough distinguished: some of the offences of a
sexual nature against children are included in category 3, others in category 5; 6) THB combined
with offences that involve immigration law aspects, such as migrant smuggling; 7) THB combined
with one other type of offence, not belonging to one of the above-mentioned categories, such as
violation of the opium act, theft and illegal entry into a dwelling; and 8) THB combined with

or partly THB. Table 5.2 gives an idea of the (combination of) offences of which the

several other types of offences. This may be a combination of THB with several of the above-
mentioned offences, and/or with several other crimes.

7 The percentages amounted in the successive years 1995 to 2001 to 18%, 13%, 17%, 18%, 16%, 26%
and 21% respectively. There can then be no question of a clear increase or reduction in the
proportion of women among the suspects over the years, but there was a peak in 2000.

Well over a third of the cases involved suspicion of only THB (the first row in the
table). 38% of cases involved suspicion of THB in combination with one other type of
offence (rows 2 to 7 together). This was comparatively often a form of violence or
membership of a criminal organisation. 26% of cases involved suspicion of THB in
combination with several other types of offences (row 8 in the table). 2001, compared
with the preceding years, showed an increase in suspicion of THB in combination with
Immigration Law offences, and a reduction in THB in combination with several other
types of offences.

5.4 The suspects

The suspects of THB are usually men, namely in 81% of cases. Per year the proportion
of female suspects varied from 13% (in 1996) to 26% (in 2000).7 



50 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

8 This differentiation is made because the same person may be suspected of several THB
offences.

9 32% fell in the age category 18 to 25 years, 24% in the category 26 to 30 years and 25% in the
category 31 to 40 years. 

10 In the successive years respectively 37.5%, 34%, 34.5%, 22%, 40%, 28% and 31% of the suspects
were born in the Netherlands.

11 An accent indicates that this involves a shared position. 

The age of the suspects at the time of their first act of THB of which they were
suspected,8 was in over 81% of the cases somewhere between 18 and 40 years9 and was
on average around 30 years. From 1995 to 2001 inclusive there were 32 underage
suspects. They account for 4% of the total number of suspects. In 2001 the (average)
age of the suspects was a bit higher than in the years before this. The proportion of
young suspects (aged up to 25 years) was in that year 24% compared with 37%, 40% and
35% in the years 1998 to 2000 inclusive. 

The country of birth of the suspects was often not the Netherlands. The percentages
of suspects born in the Netherlands varied from 22% (in 1998) to 40% (in 1999).10 
Countries of birth that frequently occurred among the suspects are shown in Table 5.3.
Also shown per year of registration with the PPS is the ranking of the first five
positions.11

more time-related developments. Examples of these are the – comparatively – less

Hungary, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the former Soviet Union and

these countries in the past.

14 These are: Angola, Egypt, Ghana, Gold Coast, Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, Liberia, Niger,
Nigeria, Portuguese West Africa, Rwanda, Sudan and Tunisia.

often occurrence of Hungary as country of birth after 1995 and the – seemingly
temporary – ‘rise’ of Nigeria as a country of origin of suspects since 1998; in 2001
Nigeria no longer occupies a prominent place among the countries of birth. When
interpreting this table one must consider that a country of origin may score high at
one time because several people operating separately from one another, have been
arrested, but also because one large network with a lot of suspects from the same
country of origin has been rounded up.
Table 5.4 offers a rather different view of the backgrounds of the suspects, in which
their countries of birth are classified by region and are then shown by year of
registration. The same breakdown was chosen as in the previous report, namely: a) the
Netherlands b) Central and Eastern Europe12 c) Turkey and Morocco13 d) Africa14 e)
Surinam, the Dutch Antilles and Indonesia15 f) Europe other16 g) Central and South

Around 30% of the suspects were born in the Netherlands, also around 30% came
originally from Central or Eastern Europe, 15% from Turkey or Morocco and 9% from
Africa. In total 13% of the suspects came from the other regions of origin together
(rows 5 to 11 in the table). The slow rise highlighted in the previous report in the
proportion of suspects from Africa seen up to 2000 has not continued in 2001. The
proportion of suspects from Central and Eastern Europe on the other hand increased
considerably in 2001 and amounts to almost double the number of suspects born in
the Netherlands.

5.5 Handling by the Public Prosecution Service

Table 5.5 gives a summary, per year of registration, of the number of cases in which
the suspect is remanded in custody.

In over three quarters of the cases (varying per year from 68% to 83%) the suspect was
detained when the case was brought to court.

21 This is then contrary to the first report in which the year of registration, even where this
involved handling and judgement, always served as the starting point. The difference (between
the number of cases registered with the PPS and the number of cases dealt with by the PPS) is
due to the fact that the PPS has not yet taken a follow-up decision in all cases. By way of
explanation: some of the cases registered at the end of 2001 will not be dealt with by the PPS
until 2002.

22 To another district or abroad.
23 Important grounds for discharge are: ‘no legal evidence’, ‘wrongly reported as suspect’, ‘small

share in the offence’ and ‘old offence’.
24 The latter of course only occurs in case of suspicion of THB in combination with other types of

offences.

Table 5.6 shows how the PPS handles cases. In the above this involved the 892
criminal cases registered over the period 1995 to 2001 inclusive. Table 5.6 involves the
857 cases handled by the PPS over the period 1995 to 2001 inclusive.21

In cases that (partly) relate to suspicion of THB summons is by far the most frequent
method of handling the case. In over a quarter of cases the case was unconditionally
discharged23 and in 5% of cases a summons was served for other offences.24 The other
forms of settlement (transfer, conditional discharge and bargain) are only used
sporadically.



54 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

25 Mention is purposely made of ‘the same period’ and not of ‘the same cases’. Because time
passes between registration and handling by the PPS and also between handling by the PPS
and the judgement of the court, this does not always involve the same cases.

26 These are not then precisely the same cases as those registered in the same period by the PPS,
or dealt with by the PPS. In particular some of the cases dealt with further in the past will have
been brought to court in preceding years by the PPS. And some of the cases handled in 2001 by
the PPS, will only come to court in 2002 (at the earliest).

5.6 Judgement by the court

Over the same period 1995 to 2001 inclusive25 the court dealt with a total of 516 THB
cases (in the first instance).26 Table 5.7 gives a summary of the judgements, per year of
judgement.

In a large majority of the summoned cases (88%) a sentence was imposed. In 7% of
cases acquittal followed. These percentages do not differ from one another much per
year, though there were comparatively more acquittals in 2000.

The judgement is also interesting, seen by the combination of offences in the charge.
Table 5.8 gives an overview of the judgements from the years 1995 to 2001 inclusive.

In 84% of cases in which sentences were imposed, this was imprisonment (in 3% of
cases in combination with an unconditional fine) and in 10% of cases this was
community service. Unconditional fines, only conditional sentence or only additional
sentences28 (or measures) were only occasionally imposed.

The (unconditional) imprisonment has an average duration of 26 months29. This
average is the lowest for charges of suspicion of only THB (17.2 months30) and the
highest for charges of suspicion of THB in combination with several types of offences
(34 months31).

5.7 Appeal

An appeal was brought against 234 of the total of 516 court judgements (45%). That was
done 122 times by the suspect (in almost all cases after sentence was imposed), 23 times
by the PPS (mainly in case of acquittal) and 89 times by both parties (in all cases after
sentence was imposed).



6 Other figures

This chapter outlines different figures relating to THB, as they emerge in various
publications. This outline also includes figures relating to prostitution, because
according to the regulations now applicable in the Netherlands, THB is still placed in
the context of exploitation only in the sex industry. The purpose of this outline is to
offer a brief, efficient overview of available indicators relating to prostitution and
THB.

Table 6.1 only presents figures that relate to the (whole) of the Netherlands. Figures
that relate to abroad are not included in the table. Figures in relation to municipalities,
regions, etc. are also left out of account. 

The figures presented in Table 6.1 relate to the year under which they are placed. If
data are known or calculated over a period of several years, then the table-cells for
these years are combined. If a report states that this is an annually recurring number,
then the number is placed under the year of publication of the report.

The figures in most cases can be commented on in one way or the other. For example,
in the publications in which the figures are presented, factors are mentioned that
affect the reliability and/or level of the figures. Also, an explanation is often given of
the way in which, or the method by which the figures have been collected or
calculated. It has nevertheless been decided in this chapter not to give an explanation
of the figures. The reader is referred to the sources mentioned to check how precisely
a figure came about and what the reliability of the data presented is.

7 Summary and conclusions

7.1 Introduction

This report charts figures relating to trafficking in human beings (THB). For this, the
Bureau of the Dutch National Rapporteur on THB (BNRM) has firstly carried out its
own research work1 and secondly collected figures, as they emerge in publications. In
this chapter the results are presented briefly and in relation to one another. The
emphasis is placed here on the results for 2001, being the most recent complete
reporting year, and on developments over time. This report must be seen and read in
conjunction with the first report that contains all sorts of background information and
is of a more reflective nature. The conclusions and recommendations formulated in
the first report still apply without restriction; the cabinet viewpoint on them has only
recently been published and they still had to be discussed in the Lower House, at the
time of writing this second report. This report therefore only discusses to a limited
degree the results obtained. Also, no further and far reaching conclusions are drawn
and/or recommendations formulated. In the next, third, report conclusions and
recommendations will, however, again be formulated. 

Before going into the results, it is also important to state that the charting of the scale
and character of THB, in quantitative terms, is a difficult task. After all, an (unknown)
proportion of THB escapes the eye of the various bodies involved, directly or
indirectly, with THB. By finding out and presenting the data that are available, an
indication can, however, be obtained of the character and scale of the phenomenon of
THB.

7.2 Victims

Number of victims
In 2001 the Dutch Foundation against Trafficking in Women (STV) registered 284
victims of THB. The number of victims reported to the STV does, however, as regards
character and scale form an unknown selection of the total number of victims of THB
in the Netherlands, but also of the number of victims that come into contact with the



62 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

2 See for an explanation of this regulation paragraph 3.2 and paragraph 7.5.

police and (victim support) organisations. The latter is caused on the one hand,
because not all victims known to ‘third parties’ are reported to the STV. On the other
hand, because in the course of 2001 the STV was less easily contactable. Other sources
then indicate higher numbers of victims of THB. For example the BNRM found that
in 2000 608 victims came into contact with victim support organisations (NRM,
2002). Victims may have been counted several times here, after all they may be in
contact with several victim support organisations, but this distortion is probably
(partly) offset again because not all victim support organisations in the Netherlands
have provided data for this investigation. On the basis of the records mentioned and
others, different researchers have attempted to estimate the total number of victims in
the Netherlands. The most recent estimate comes from Van Dijk (2002), who
calculated that the number of victims in the Netherlands in 2000 would be at least
3,500. This would mean that at least one fifth of all prostitutes according to legal
criteria are victims of THB. Earlier estimates related to 1996 and 1997. These estimates
range from 2000 victims of THB in total to also 2000 only from Central and Eastern
Europe.

Underage victims
There are various estimates and figures available for the number of minors in
prostitution and the number of victims of THB among them. The most recent
estimate – for 1997 – is that there are 600 to 1150 underage victims of THB in the
Netherlands (40% to 77% of the total number of underage prostitutes) (Venicz &
Vanwesenbeeck in First report of the Dutch National Rapporteur on THB (NRM)
(2002)). BNRM found that in 2000 (at least) 129 underage victims of THB were in
contact with victim support organisations (NRM, 2002). In 2001 the Immigration and
Naturalisation Service (IND) registered 72 applications from minors applying for a
residence permit under the B-9 regulation.2 These minors, however, also include
children of victims and witnesses. In 2001 27 (10%) underage victims were reported to
the STV. In 2001 41% of the police investigations completed and sent in, related to
underage victims. This also applied for 20% of the cases registered with the Public
Prosecution Service (PPS) (~suspects). This at first sight remarkable difference
between the police and the PPS data is probably caused because a) not all underage
victims have also reported an offence, b) not all suspects identified in an investigation,
that (partly) related to underage victims, also themselves might be suspected of
trafficking in minors and c) the selection within the PPS database was carried out by
selection of the paragraphs of articles 250ter and 250a Penal Code that relate to
underage victims, while cases that (partly) relate to underage victims may also be
registered under the general penal code article, or under other paragraphs.

Male victims
The number of men/boys among prostitutes is comparatively low (according to
estimates 5% to 25% of the total number of prostitutes in the Netherlands) (Van der



7 summary and conclusions 63

Helm & Van Mens (1999); Venicz & Vanwesenbeeck (2000)). Also men/boys, as is
generally assumed (e.g. in Van Gelder, 1998), are much less often victims of THB than
women/girls. Of the investigations into THB completed by the police over the period
1997-2001 one investigation (1%) also related to boys. Of the people who in 2001 made
an appeal for the B-9 regulation in fact 7% were of the male sex, but these may (in part)
also be witnesses of THB. The STV only very occasionally receives reports of
men/boys that are exploited in prostitution.

Origin of victims or recruitment countries
Victims of THB are recruited in the Netherlands and/or abroad. In the first case this is
called THB within the Netherlands, in the second case cross-border THB. Of the
investigations that the police completed in 2001, 25% related to THB within the
Netherlands and 75% to cross-border THB. The majority of the foreign victims (70% to
80%) – in both 2001 and previous years – came from Central and Eastern Europe. In
second place comes Africa, where 15% to 22% of the victims come from. Asia, Latin
America and Western Europe score comparatively low. In all the records/researches
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Romania
emerge as major countries of origin in Central and Eastern Europe in 2001. The STV
also mentions Lithuania, in the B-9 research Slovakia also scores comparatively high
and in the police research Moldavia jumps out as a ‘rising country of origin’. For a
number of these countries in 2001 there was no visa obligation (Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Slovakia), for others there was (the Russian
Federation, Ukraine, Moldavia). Whether or not a visa obligation exists does not seem
to play a great part in the decision to recruit in a particular country.

Reports by victims
Prosecution of THB may also be carried out without reporting an offence. However, a
report is in practice often considered to be vital. Of the number of victims of THB
who report an offence, different records are available. None of these data do however
give an accurate or complete picture of the actual situation. Nevertheless, the results
are briefly set out here. Firstly the police Identification Service System (HKS, obtained
via the National Crime Chart). This records 51 reports of THB in 2001. Secondly, the
records of the IND of victims and witnesses that reported an offence and wanted to
use the B-9 regulation. There were 147 in 2001. Thirdly, the reports of THB by victims,
that in 2001 led to the cases (~suspects) sent in to the PPS. These were 186. This latter
number is the highest, while this is a selection of victims that come into contact with
the police, who decide to report an offence, for which the report leads to a police
investigation and this investigation is also again completed and sent in to the PPS.
When the number of 186 reports in 2001 is combined with the estimate of 3,500
victims in 2000 (Van Dijk, 2002), then it is found that 5% of the victims of THB would
report an offence. This corresponds reasonably well with estimates of police officials
and victim support organisations regarding the percentage of THB victims found that

PPM/dNP) and the Foundation for Support and Reception of Prostitutes (Stichting
Hulpverlening en Opvang Prostituees – SHOP).

report an offence. They assume a readiness among these victims to report an offence
of 5% to 10%.3

7.3 Perpetrators

Perpetrators or suspects
In 2001 the police identified 224 suspects of THB, of which 179 (80%) were arrested
and 142 (63%) were ‘sent in’ to the PPS. The number of suspects rose considerably in
the last two years, but similar to the number of investigations that the police
completed. The average number of suspects per investigation remained more or less
the same over the period 1997-2000 and even fell in 2001. Also a check was made with
the PPS on how many cases (~suspects) were registered in 2001. There are 132 of these.
The difference with the number of suspects ‘sent in’ from the police research is so
small, that no research consequences – in terms of unreliability – have to be associated
with this. According to the police research, of the suspects arrested in 2001, 29% are
women. The proportion of women among the suspects increased comparatively over
the last two years. Of the suspects registered with the PPS in 2001, 21% are women.
Furthermore, of all the suspects arrested in 2001, 12% operate a sex establishment. Of
the operators of sex establishments arrested, 76% were ‘sent in’ to the PPS.

Origin of suspects
According to the police research, almost half of the suspects arrested in 2001 are of
Dutch nationality. Some of these were however born outside the Netherlands. A high
proportion of suspects in 2001 came from (former) Yugoslavia, Albania, Nigeria and,
to a lesser degree, Ghana. Suspects of THB within the Netherlands come
comparatively more often from Morocco than suspects of cross-border THB. In the
PPS research – in addition to (former) Yugoslavia – Bulgaria, Turkey and the (former)
Soviet Union emerge as the main countries of origin of suspects in 2001. In 2001,
according to the police research, the percentage of foreign suspects residing illegally in
the Netherlands rose compared with foreign suspects legally residing (that is with a
residence permit or in some other legal way) in the Netherlands (from 10% to 42%).
Though, foreign suspects without a residence permit do not come significantly more
often from countries without than from countries with a visa obligation. To what
extent the lifting of the visa obligation for applicant-member states of the EU can be
seen in the origin of suspects of THB, will be further examined in the next report of
the NRM. 



7 summary and conclusions 65

Co-operation
The majority of the suspects arrested in 2001 (75%) belong to a criminal network.
These criminal networks are usually extensive and widely branched, and bring their
victims into prostitution in several countries in the European Union (EU). In 2001 28
(58%) of police investigations focused on (branches of) ‘criminal networks’. In that
same year 12 (25%) ‘soloists’ were traced and 8 (17%) ‘isolated criminal groups’ (see for
the definitions paragraph 4.4). 

7.4 Modus operandi

In this paragraph a few data relating to the modus operandi of traffickers in human
beings are summarised. Only data from the police research are presented here. Much
more about the way in which traffickers in human beings operate can of course be said
on the basis of other sources. This was partly done in the First report of the Dutch
National Rapporteur on THB (NRM, 2002) and the NRI report THB in the Netherlands
1997-2000 (Van Dijk, 2002). The data presented below form a supplement or update to
the data already presented on the mechanisms of THB.

Travel route and travel and residence documents
The journey usually takes place by land, via Germany. This only seems logical in view
of the fact that most victims come from Central and Eastern Europe (see paragraph
7.2). Very regularly victims in the Netherlands were in possession of a forged or false
passport. It is not clear whether the same passport is also used for the journey to the
Netherlands. As far as is known, visas are forged or counterfeited much less often than
passports. Usually a visa is applied for, or the person travels without a visa.

Exploitation in prostitution
Traffickers in human beings use many means of coercion to bring or hold people in
prostitution and/or to confiscate their earnings. Victims are very often threatened
with violence, or violence is actually used. Furthermore, victims are often locked up,
kept under constant surveillance or their freedom is otherwise restricted. The taking
away of passports and the imposition of (fictitious) debts mainly occurs in the case of
cross-border THB. In the case of THB within the Netherlands victims are, more often
than for cross-border THB, enticed into prostitution with carefully planned, ‘played
out’ lover-boy techniques (the loverboy method). Victims from Nigeria and Malawi
report voodoo-practices. 

Mobility
In 2001 half of the police investigations involved cases where victims were brought
into prostitution not only in the Netherlands, but also elsewhere in Europe, relatively
often in Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain. In two thirds of the investigations (67%) it
emerges that victims are (also) ‘employed’ in various towns in the Netherlands.



66 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

4 For example committing violence, rape, unlawful detention and falsification or fraud with
travel and residence documents.

Proceeds of THB
The average illegally acquired gain per suspect was the highest in 2001, namely roughly
€ 210,000. In an investigation the illegally acquired gain is, however, only calculated if
the total amount of illegally earned money is considered substantial. The amount
mentioned is as a result not necessarily representative of the earnings of the average
trafficker in human beings. For this reason police officials in the police research were
also asked to estimate how much the suspects distinguished in an investigation earned
with the THB investigated. From this it emerges that in half of the investigations into
THB completed in 2001, more than € 45,000 is estimated to be earned. In total, in 2000
THB in the Netherlands brought in an estimated gross amount of roughly 
€ 85,000,000 (see paragraph 4.8 for the calculation). In 14% of the investigations
victims have, as far as the police know – via civil law proceedings or via a ‘joinder of
injured party for material and immaterial damage’ in the criminal proceedings –
attempted to get back some of the money they have earned, or to obtain compensation
for damage suffered.

Characteristics of organised crime
In 7% of cases (~suspects) registered by the PPS in 2001, in addition to THB, charges
were also brought of belonging to a criminal organisation (art. 140 Penal Code). This
indicates a lower limit and does not mean that in other cases there is no question of
criminal organisations. For various reasons this charge is not in fact always brought.
Research by Van Dijk (2002) has shown that criminal groups and networks meet a
number of, but not all the characteristics of organised crime. It was for example found
that they try to evade the upper world rather than try to infiltrate or aim for economic
or political power. The area of operation, from a geographic point of view, is however
generally large. Many suspects and criminal groups are characterised by violence, both
towards victims and relations of victims (often family) and towards competing
traffickers in human beings. Measures often used to prevent or counteract tracing
include threatening victims who want to report an offence, the use of false and/or
alternating identities for perpetrators and victims, and the frequent moving of victims
through the Netherlands and Europe.

Criminal activities other than THB
In 2001 over half of the investigations involved cases where the suspects also
committed offences other than THB (or THB-related offences)4. Crimes against
properties and narcotics related crimes score high. Some way behind follow weapons
related crimes and migrant smuggling. 
That same year in well over two thirds of the cases (~suspects) registered with the PPS
there was a suspicion of THB in combination with one of more other types of offences
(particularly violence or belonging to a criminal organisation). This percentage is
higher than in the police research, because THB-related offences are regarded as a
separate offence in the PPS research. 



7 summary and conclusions 67

7.5 Police investigation

Police investigation into THB
The number of investigations into THB completed by the police rose considerably,
particularly in 2001. In that year 48 investigations were completed and 142 suspects
‘sent in’ to the PPS. The immediate cause for the investigations was in one third of the
cases a ‘spontaneous’ report. In equal second place are controls in the prostitution
environment and information from other investigations. On average, an investigation
into THB in 2001 took 6 months. 

Prostitution sectors involved
In over half of the investigations it emerges that victims are (also) employed in
window prostitution, and in well over half (also) in clubs/brothels. Comparatively far
fewer investigations were carried out that involved prostitution in the escort sector or
street prostitution. In 2001 the number of investigations involving the escort sector
did, however, increase comparatively greatly, after a low point in 2000. 

Criminal financial investigation
In one third of the investigations a criminal financial investigation was opened. The
number of criminal financial investigations that led to a confiscation order in 2001 was
higher than in 2000, namely 93% (against 63% in 2000). BNRM checked in its first
report in how many cases a confiscation order was instituted out of the cases
(~suspects) registered over the period from 1995 to the first half of 2000 inclusive with
the PPS, where a summons was issued. This was found to apply in 18% of cases. It is
stated that this does not appear often at first sight, but information from PPS data
shows that this happened in no more than 11% of cases in the same period with regard
to infringement of the Opium Act.

The B-9 regulation
Foreign victims of THB residing illegally in the Netherlands who report an offence –
and so co-operate in the tracing and prosecution of the suspects – are offered
reception and a temporary residence status under the B-9 regulation. The number of
victims who obtain a residence status on this basis, is recorded by the IND. For
witnesses of THB a similar regulation applies. Witnesses may themselves be (have
been) victims of THB, but do not have to be. Because the IND makes no distinction in
its records between victims and witnesses of THB, the records of the IND cannot just
be regarded as victim records. In 2001 for 147 victims/witnesses of THB a residence
permit was applied for on the basis of the B-9 regulation (a B-9 permit). The number
of applications rose considerably in that year compared with previous years and this
increase will very probably continue in 2002. In 2001 122 B-9 permits were granted.
This means that in 2001 upon 25 applications (17%) no B-9 permit was awarded. There
may be a number of reasons for this. For example, applications are withdrawn or
expire. This happens, for example, if the investigation and/or the prosecution is not
started or is stopped. It also happens that victims/witnesses who report an offence or
make a statement – and make an appeal for the B-9 regulation – ‘disappear’ before the



68 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

B-9-status is granted. Possibly victims return to their country of origin or go back to
work in prostitution, self employed or ‘employed’ by traffickers in human beings.

7.6 Prosecution

In 2001 – as previously stated in this chapter – 132 cases (~suspects) relating to THB
were registered with the PPS. In 63% of these cases a summons was issued because of
suspicion of THB and in 7% for acts other than THB. 29% of the cases were
(un)conditionally discharged. 
In 2001 86 cases relating to THB were settled by the court. In 87% of these cases a
sentence was imposed. This was in most cases imprisonment.

7.7 After the lifting of the general ban on brothels

As of 1 October 2000, with the lifting of the general ban on brothels, the way was
opened for the running of prostitution as a legal business. Municipalities lay down
conditions by means of a licensing system under which the running of prostitution can
be permitted within their municipal borders. Supervisors (so far usually the police)
check whether the conditions are met. In many regions, these checks are combined
with controls for illegal immigrants. In these controls they are also on the look out for
indications of THB. If prostitution businesses do not meet the conditions laid down,
administrative measures can be taken, such as imposing a fine or temporary or
otherwise closure of the premises. By regulating the prostitution sector in this way, via
an administrative path an attempt is made to make it as unattractive as possible for the
sex establishment operator to employ victims of THB or to work with minors. This is
in addition to the criminal law opportunities that have been present for many decades
already. The figures presented in this report partly relate to the period after the lifting
of the general ban on brothels. However, the new approach to prostitution policy has
not yet got off the ground in all municipalities (see also Daalder, 2002). Furthermore,
in particular larger municipalities with a comparatively extensive prostitution industry
did in fact run ahead of the lifting of the ban and already combined a tolerance
situation with a type of licensing system. As a result, the present data for the year 2001
cannot simply be interpreted as ‘effects of the lifting of the general ban on brothels’.
To draw conclusions on this, research with a broader set up is required. This has
meanwhile been carried out by the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre
(WODC) of the Ministry of Justice (Daalder, 2002). The results of this research and
possible changes observed after the lifting of the general ban on brothels will be
discussed in the next, third, report of the NRM.

Annex 1 Notes on tables, statistics and terminology

Notes on the tables presented 

This report includes many tables. Below are some comments that are important for
the interpretation of these tables.
Due to rounding, the tables do not always add up to exactly 100%. For the sake of
readability the tables do, however, always indicate 100%.
When numbers are set out in a column of a table, in the heading of the relevant column
the letter N is used, an abbreviation for ‘number’.
In the tables a dash (-) shows that the number is zero, and a dash (-) also indicates that
the corresponding percentage is 0%. If the number is higher than zero, but the
percentage when rounded comes to 0%, 0% is shown. 

Notes on the statistics used

Standard deviation
This report sometimes indicates what the average is, for example the average number
of suspects in investigations into THB. In addition, the number (N, see above) and the
so-called standard deviation are also always given. The standard deviation indicates
the extent to which the numbers on which the average is calculated, differ. The higher
the standard deviation, the more this is the case. This is not the place to discuss
statistical methods at length. However, a small example for clarification: in a class ten
people all get a 6 for a test. The average report figure is then a 6, the standard deviation
is low. After all, everyone scores the same. In another class five people get a 2 for the
test and five people a 10. Here too the average is a 6. The standard deviation is,
however, high here, because the people get a very wide range of scores.

Index
In some tables an index is given. The index shows how much the number of – for
example suspects – has changed in a particular year compared with a base year. Which
year is taken as a base year is indicated in the heading of the table. This year is set at
100. An index of higher than 100 indicates a rise with respect to the base year and an
index of lower than 100 a fall. For example: an index of 200 indicates that the number
has doubled with respect to the base year.

Significance 
In this report results for different groups are sometimes compared with one another.
If this is the case a check is usually made as to whether the difference found is
‘significant’ or not. This is then indicated in the text, with in a footnote the
corresponding values chi2, df and p. This means that a check has been made as to how
big the chance is that the difference found is based on coincidence. Let us give a



72 Trafficking in Human Beings; Second report of the Dutch National Rapporteur

fictitious example here too. Say that there are three people who drink cola each day
and three people who never drink cola. One person in the first group dies of a heart
attack, no one in the second group. Is drinking cola related to having a heart attack?
This is difficult to say with so few people. There is a high chance that the result found
is based on coincidence and that drinking cola has nothing to do with heart attacks. A
test would then show that the difference is not significant. Now there are 180 people
of which 90 people drink cola and 90 do not, and 30 cola drinkers from the first group
die of a heart attack. The man in the street would say: ‘that cannot be down to chance’.
A statistical test would show ‘this difference is significant’.

In this report it is assumed that the chance of coincidence may not be greater than 5% –
a percentage often used in circles of researchers. Exactly how big this chance is, can be
seen from the p value indicated in the footnote. For example: p<.01 means that the
chance of a coincidence is less than 1%. The values chi2 and df (this stands for the
number of degrees of freedom) are values that are necessary to determine whether
differences are significant and are not discussed further here.

Notes on terminology used

Victims of THB
Both women and girls, and men and boys, may become victims of THB. Because most
victims of THB according to the present Dutch definition, that is (still) related to
exploitation in the sex industry, are women and girls, and to avoid complicated he/she
schemes, in this report female victims are always referred to.

Cases recorded with the Public Prosecution Service
The PPS records (criminal) cases, which are cases against one suspect. Because in theory
several cases relating to one suspect may be registered with the PPS, the number of
cases does not equate exactly with the number of suspects. Because the numbers will
not, however, differ much in practice, for the sake of readability, this report also talks
about cases registered with the PPS (~suspects).

Central and Eastern Europe
This report sometimes talks of Central and Eastern Europe, as complementary to
Western Europe, and sometimes of the regions Central and Eastern Europe, which in
the first case means the countries Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and
in the second case countries from the former Soviet Union and the Russian
Federation. If the latter is the case, then this is always explicitly explained in the text. In
other cases one can then assume the first alternative.
