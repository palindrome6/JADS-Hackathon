Trafficking for exploitation outside the sex industry 
 
Heleen de Jonge van Ellemeet and Monika Smit 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Although slavery has long been officially abolished in all countries, it still exists today. People are being 
transported across borders or within countries with the intention to exploit them. These practices are 
currently most often referred to as trafficking in human beings (THB). Where THB was initially 
associated especially or exclusively with women and with exploitation in the sex industry, a wider 
interpretation is increasingly gaining ground. Males are also known to be exploited in the sex industry, 
while men, women and children are being exploited in other economic areas as well. Rightly therefore, the 
definition of THB in the UN Trafficking Protocol1 covers trafficking for the purpose of exploitation in 
both the sex industry and other labour situations, and additionally trafficking for the removal of organs.  
In the Netherlands, the national criminal legislation on THB was broadened accordingly on the first of 
January 2005. This in turn implied a broadening of the area on which the reports of the Dutch National 
Rapporteur on THB and her bureau (BNRM), which have the task to collect information on THB and to 
report to the Dutch government, including recommendations on the fight against THB, should focus.2  
In order to explore this newly acknowledged realm of THB, this chapter focuses on exploitation in labour 
situations outside the sex industry ('other forms of exploitation'), particularly in the Netherlands. But first 
we touch upon two possibly confusing matters in defining and tackling THB. 
 
 
Two possibly confusing matters in defining and tackling THB 
 
Although significant, it is not always easy to make a distinction between trafficking on the one hand, and 
human smuggling and prostitution on the other. Here we discuss each distinction in turn. 
 
Trafficking and smuggling 
There is a tendency to regard THB as a form of illegal immigration and to confuse it with human 
smuggling. Although both phenomena can be regarded as undesirable consequences of globalisation, and 
although both traffickers and smugglers of human beings exploit people’s desire to improve their lives by 
building a better future for themselves elsewhere, there are also fundamental differences (see also Shelley, 
2003; ILO, 2005). Smuggling concerns assisting people to enter or stay in another country illegally. It 
involves, first and foremost, compromising a state’s territorial integrity. It may be that a smuggled person 
is subsequently exploited, in order to pay for the journey, for instance, but this need not necessarily be the 
case. Furthermore, the transport and accommodation organised for the smuggled person may be so 

                                          
1 The Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which is 
linked to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and came into effect in December 2003.  
2 The Rapporteur holds an independent position. Various methods are used to collect information for the reports, 
including literature study, the studying of laws, treaties and jurisprudence, interviews with key figures from the field, 
organising meetings, participation at symposiums, conferences and expert meetings and secondary analysis of 
information collected by others. The authors of this chapter both work for BNRM.

dangerous or degrading, that he or she could be regarded as a victim whose human rights have been 
violated, but again this need not necessarily be the case. Whenever the 'voluntary' agreement between a 
human smuggler and the party smuggled is the result of deception, or involves high debts, and leads 
(directly or indirectly) to forced labour, the smuggling case becomes a trafficking case. THB is in itself 
and by definition a serious violation of the fundamental rights and personal integrity of the person being 
trafficked. It often involves cross-border activities, but this is not an essential feature. The essence of THB 
is exploitation, the abuse of people in the pursuit of profit, by way of violence, threats, deception or the 
abuse of the victim’s vulnerable position, as a result of which his or her freedom to choose is considerably 
restricted. It is a form of modern slavery. The protocols supplementing the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organised Crime also make this distinction between human smuggling and human 
trafficking. Whereas the 'smuggling protocol'3 refers to the smuggling of migrants, the trafficking protocol 
refers to the trafficking of victims. And in the most recent proposal for a European Union Council 
directive dealing with trafficking and smugglinga similar distinction is made.  
 
Trafficking and prostitution 
The fight against THB for sexual exploitation is often confused with the battle that some wage against 
prostitution. They regard not only THB but all prostitution as a form of violence (generally against 
women) and as a form of slavery that needs to be combated or even criminalised. In this (abolitionist or 
prohibitionist) view, the phenomenon of prostitution is lumped together with the one of THB (Agustín, 
2001). Countries or authors who do not seek a solution to the problem of THB by prohibiting the buying 
and selling of sexual services are criticised, often using suggestive or incorrect information (BNRM, 
2005). 
However, there are disadvantages associated with a repressive approach to prostitution in the fight against 
trafficking. Opponents of such an approach take the view that it is precisely the criminalization that plays 
into the hands of criminal and exploitative networks in the sex industry (see, for example, Sörensen, 
2003). They feel that prostitution continues regardless of criminalisation, while at the same time sex 
workers are being stigmatised, criminalised or - because their clients could be prosecuted – marginalised. 
Moreover, they have to solicit their clients in secret, which makes their work more dangerous (e.g. 
Boonen, 2000, p.47; Östergren, 20034). 
The reverse of the prohibitionist or abolitionist approach is the labourist approach. Labourists 
take the view that not all (migrant) prostitutes are victims of THB (see e.g. Gülçür & Ilkkaracan, 2002; 
Butcher, 2003). They regard prostitution as work and a prostitute not as a victim, at least not by definition 
(see also Boonen, 2000; Verhoeven, 2003), but as a person competent to act for herself. According to 
labourists, the essence of THB and forced prostitution is that, within the context of a labour situation, a 
person’s freedom to choose is violated. The fact that it concerns prostitution is less relevant. Labourists 
seek solutions to THB in improvements in the conditions under which prostitutes live and work, and a 
strengthening of their legal position (Haveman, 1998; Loff et al, 2003), for example by regulating the sex 
industry. 
 
Whatever position one may take in the debate briefly described above, it is important 
not to devote too much energy to this debate itself, all the more since the study by a Norwegian working 
group on the legal regulation of the purchase of sexual services, which compared the Swedish

(abolitionist) with the Dutch (regulative) approach, showed that neither solved the problem of THB, while 
both had (albeit different) negative side effects (Working group on the legal regulation of the purchase of 
sexual services, 2004 (English abstract)). It would be more fruitful to join forces to tackle THB, the issue 
on which international agreement has already been achieved in drawing up the UN Trafficking Protocol, 
and that involves coercion, forced labour, or the exploitation of minors, not only in the sex industry, but 
elsewhere as well.  
 
With regard to exploitation in those other economic sectors, the partly ideological and moral debate on 
prostitution described above, does not play a role. However, there are other issues involved, as will be 
shown in the following sections. 
 
 
'Other forms of exploitation' do they occur in the Netherlands? 
 
The main reason for the new trafficking article in the Dutch Penal Code (art. 273a)5 was to amend national 
law in line with international treaties, such as the aforementioned UN Trafficking Protocol and the EU 
Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings6, rather than a sense of urgency based on 
actual (local) experiences with 'other forms of exploitation'. There is in fact limited insight in what might 
be going on in this respect, but on the basis of information from neighbouring countries, we at BNRM 
suspected that 'other forms of exploitation' occur in the Netherlands as well.  
 
Experiences in neighbouring countries 
A report from the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight Against Racism (1998), for 
example, goes into exploitation of foreign football players and of domestic servants in diplomat families. 
From the annual reports of this Centre we know furthermore that, for some time now, a substantial 
proportion of all trafficking victims in Belgium are victims of exploitation outside the sex industry. 
Percentages mentioned range from 25 to 50% (Centrum voor Gelijkheid van Kansen en 
Racismebestrijding, 1999; 2000; 2002). High percentages, but the reports also mention definition 
problems: when is something trafficking, when moonlighting or smuggling? 
A report from a French parliamentary commission (2001) deals with exploitative employment of foreign 
workers in clandestine confection and leather workshops and in restaurants, forced begging by minors and 
domestic slavery.  
The findings in these reports were among the reasons for BNRM to prompt the Dutch government to make 
haste with the new THB law and to study the occurrence of 'other forms of exploitation' in the Netherlands 
(BNRM, 2002).  
 
Since then, more publications came out, indicating situations of labour exploitation in other western 
European countries as well. Anderson and Rogaly (2005), for example, who studied forced labour in the 
UK, found abuses in a wide range of labour situations, such as cheap takeaways, expensive restaurants, 

                                          
 
5 Punishable under this article are certain activities (recruiting, transporting, accommodating someone) using specific 
means (force, violence, deception, misuse of a vulnarable position) with the intention to exploit that person (in the 
sex industry, forced labour, or slavery like practices), profiting (economically) from sexual acts of minors, and 
certain activities aimed at removal of organs. 
6 The purpose of this EU Framework decision is to bring the member states more in line as far as legislation and 
regulations with regard to THB are concerned. The Framework decision came into force in Augsust 2002.

mushroom picking, bakeries, private homes, fishing vessels, all night stores, the food managing and 
packaging industry, construction, (contract) cleaning and (residential) care. In a 2005 ILO study on 
trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation in Germany, malpractices were observed in domestic 
services, construction, the hotels and catering industry (abuse of seasonal workers), the fun 
fair/entertainment sector, the international transport business and the distribution of advertisements 
(Cyrus, 2005).  
 
Research in the Netherlands 
A literature review that was indeed commissioned, as recommended by BNRM, and that was carried out 
by Van der Leun and Vervoorn (2004) shows that there is a lot of illegal employment in the Netherlands 
and that illegal employment is on the increase. Although the authors found little tangible evidence for 
slavery-like situations, they considered the risk of excesses to be growing, because of the involvement of 
malafide employment agencies - which reduces the distance between criminal circuit and undocumented 
worker - and because of a seemingly growing number of illegal workers in private homes. According to 
Bucquoye et al. (2003), in Europe the demand for services in private homes will grow, due to changing 
family structures, limited availability of affordable day care for children and because of the ageing 
population. Although illegal domestic workers who live with the families that employ them, may be 
relatively well protected from discovery of their illegal status by the authorities (Willemsen, 2005), the 
limited visibility, social isolation and multiple dependency that can easily develop in such a situation, also 
make these illegal workers particularly vulnerable to exploitation.  
Van der Leun and Vervoorn concluded that excesses can be found when you look for them. Paraphrasing 
this conclusion, we are convinced you will not see them when you do not look for them. After all, the 
same goes for exploitation in the sex industry. 
 
Building on the outcome of the aforementioned literature study, BNRM decided to extend the knowledge 
about 'other forms of exploitation' in the Netherlands by collecting recent7 casuistry on the topic. Starting 
at the beginning of 2005, very short questionnaires were sent out to a large number of possible 
respondents (social workers, legal advisors/lawyers, police, labour inspectors, and pressure/support groups 
for specific minorities). Because of the novelty of the subject, a rather broad working definition of 'other 
forms of exploitation' was used: flagrant wrongs in a labour situation outside the sex industry, in which a 
victim is forced to work. Some of the many possible indicators mentioned were: force (physical or 
otherwise), bad working conditions (for example unreasonable hours, low pay), lack of freedom (for 
example no possession of one’s own passport) and multiple dependency (for example debt bondage, or 
being dependent not only for employment, but also for food, transport or shelter). Respondents who 
indicate that they encountered possibly exploitative situations, are being interviewed extensively, either by 
phone or face to face. More organizations (such as branch/employers' organisations, and trade unions) will 
be approached in the near future. 
 
Preliminary results 
So far, we received a great variety of signals of very bad circumstances and lack of freedom in labour 
situations. They concern jobs in cleaning, restaurants, factories, meat processing, agriculture, construction 
and other industries. Victims are most often individuals who reside and/or work in the Netherlands

illegally or who have a dependent status in the form of a permit to reside with a partner.8 Individuals with 
illegal or a dependent status, especially those who do not speak Western European language, are 
particularly vulnerable for exploitation, as is apparent in the following examples. 
  
In 2003, the labour inspectorate and the police specialised in illegal migration jointly inspect a Chinese 
restaurant. They find S. a 23 year old Chinese waitress working on a false id-document. S. works there for 
a few euros a day, as well as a place to sleep (a room above the restaurant). She is taken to the police 
station for further questioning, but does not want to make any additional statement. She seems afraid and 
police officers discover that her body is covered in small scars. Some of the fresh scars on her back are 
possibly caused by hot cigarette butts. They suspect that the employer also abuses his illegal waitress 
privately. However, due to the lack of any incriminating statement, this does not lead to an investigation. 
 
In 2003 L., well educated, thirty and pregnant migrates to the Netherlands in order to move in with O., 
whom she has met in her hometown in Morocco. She is granted a temporary residence permit on the 
condition of her relationship. L. has been led to believe that O.’s financial situation is comfortable, but 
upon arrival L. finds out that he does not have a regular job and the couple shares a small room with two 
others. Using psychological pressure and violence, O. forces L. to do all the housework and to work in a 
factory as well. Although the working conditions in the factory are normal, L. becomes a victim of 
economic exploitation in the sense that she is forced to work and does not have access to her own income: 
O. spends the money and leaves L. materially neglected. On top of all this, O. abuses L. by videotaping 
their sexual intercourse without her consent. L. is under the impression that he shows these shootings to 
others, possibly at a charge.9 Due to the abuse, the workload, the worries and the progressing pregnancy, 
L. eventually becomes exhausted. The birth of a son does not change anything in the relationship: O. does 
not even provide enough food for the baby, while L. has no control of her income. When L. can no longer 
stand the situation, she takes her child and runs away to a women’s shelter. At the shelter, she is offered, 
among other things, legal assistance to arrange an independent residence permit.  
 
Some of the cases that were reported to BNRM, such as those mentioned above, are undoubtedly 
examples of THB. Others clearly indicate abuse of the vulnerable position of individuals, but do not 
constitute situations that can be described as THB and still others are in between cases. The boundary 
between illegal employment and exploitation in the sense of THB is not always clear, and exploitation 
does not only occur in employer – employee relationships, as the next case illustrates. 
 
C., a foreign male (from an EU country) has a (dependent) residence permit on the basis of his marriage to 
a (Dutch) woman. In 2002 his wife dies, and he loses his legal status. C. and his then 6 years old son 
tramp about for a while, before ending up living in a shed owned by a rack renter. During the procedure 
for a new residence permit, they do not qualify for public housing facilities. Apart from rent, the rack 
renter also demands domestic services of his 'tenant', and confiscates his credit card as means of coercion. 
Eventually, the landlord throws C. and his son out. Shortly thereafter C. gets a new residence permit, and 
he and his son find suitable housing. 
 

                                          
8 From cases not described in this contribution, another group at risk appears: less able, not very assertive women 
who face all kinds of social and psychological problems. 
9 In cases of labour exploitation within private homes, sexual abuse or exploitation are not seldom involved as well.

Although we have not yet finished our study, we can conclude that 'other forms of exploitation' in the 
sense of THB do indeed occur in the Netherlands. Perhaps not on a very large scale, but the cases that 
have come up so far are not restricted to one or two specific economic areas either. Comparable notes 
were heard at a meeting BNRM organised together with the Dutch Ministry of Justice in March 2005, 
with the aim to inform (possible) partners in the fight against THB of the broadening of the definition, but 
also to encourage and stimulate them to tackle ‘other forms of exploitation’ and to talk about 
responsibilities and division of tasks between themselves. Police, special investigation services and social 
workers attended the meeting. Many indicated having encountered manifestations of exploitation outside 
the sex industry. At the same time it was obvious that, due to lack of capacity to tackle exploitation within 
the sex industry, not everybody was 'ready to go', as far as tackling 'other forms of exploitation', or taking 
care of the victims involved, is concerned. Clearly, not everybody warms easily to the case of 
undocumented migrants who end up being exploited in a labour situation. Similar reluctance was voiced 
during the final conference of the Network for European Women’s Rights, in Birmingham.10 It seems that 
a change of attitude is requisite. 
 
 
What needs to be done? 
 
In spite of the aforementioned reluctance amongst some, we are of the opinion that 'other forms of 
exploitation' also need to be tackled and that police, social workers, as well as the general public, must be 
alert to its signals. Not only because we will not see it otherwise, but also because those practices have to 
be stopped, as they can have very serious consequences. This is clearly the case in another example, 
involving a Moroccan girl. 
 
A., from Morocco, is ten years old when, in 2000, her mother entrusts her to a Moroccan family that lives 
in the Netherlands. A. is brought into the country illegally. There she lives in a small apartment together 
with the large family. She has to do all the house work, take care of the children (of whom some are older 
than she), and be available 24 hours a day. A. is not being paid, she is being abused, she is not allowed to 
go out, and she does not go to school. After a couple of years she escapes, the police find her out on the 
streets and put her up in a general shelter. From there she moves on to protected living.  
 
The family not only exploited the girl, but violated several basic rights by not giving her the opportunity to 
make friends or to play, and by shutting the door to education, thus severely damaging her development. 
 
This girl escaped on her own, but only after a long time. Yet how many victims do not manage that, and 
how many comparable situations go on unnoticed? The question remains as to how we stop such practices 
and how we catch the people profiting from them (for example recruiters, businesses that use cheap illegal 
labour, individuals who provide false identity documents against payment, individuals who offer poor 
accommodation against exorbitant sums, and families that exploit an au pair or a domestic worker). 
 
Recognizing the victims 
It is crucial to recognize the victims, to know which signals to look for and to act upon them. In this 
respect it is worth mentioning that, in the Netherlands, the existing list of signals, used by the police to

of the University of Birmingham (for reports see www.newr.bham.ac.uk).

recognize victims of exploitation in the sex industry, is currently being adapted to be used to recognize 
victims of 'other forms of exploitation' as well.  
A complicating factor is that people in exploitative labour situations may not regard themselves as 
victims, and they can be rather self-contained and little communicative about their experiences, as is 
known to be the case with many trafficking victims who end up in the sex industry. Reasons for this 
reserve are the often illegal residence or working status, which makes them afraid of deportation, should 
their status become known to the officials. The often not so rosy perspective in the country of origin 
makes deportation an unappealing alternative, especially when there are debts to be paid. Furthermore, 
victims of 'other forms of exploitation' may have to deal with threats, fear of repercussions, and with 
feelings of shame over what has happened to them, and over the fact that they failed to make it abroad. 
These feelings of shame show in some of the interviews in a recent Dutch study on the possibilities to 
return to the country of origin after alien detention.11 One respondent states: "… the longer I stay in 
Europe, the more the home front expects from me. We want to return to our country of origin one day, but 
not empty handed. I would be burning with shame and rather die than to go back empty handed". Another 
respondent: "How can I justify the fact that I spent 15 years in Europe without bringing something back?" 
and a third: "I really can not arrive empty handed" (Van Kalmthout et al., 2005; p11; 56; 92). Exactly 
because the victims of exploitation may be unwilling to bring their case forward, Anderson and Rogaly 
(2005) recommend to base investigations into forced labour situations - to the extent possible - on 
intelligence-led investigations, taking account of complaints from trade unions and other agencies, instead 
of relying on the testimony of victims. In the Netherlands, 'intelligence-led investigations' is a popular 
topic, and is an approach that is being tried out at the moment, but the expectation of many is that the 
testimonies of victims will still play a decisive role in successful prosecution of perpetrators. 
An extra complication in recognizing the victims, is that part of the exploitation takes place in hidden 
sectors, such as the informal economy and behind private family doors (as was the case with the 
Moroccan girl in the example presented above), while these families are sometimes protected by 
diplomatic immunity. Still, in cases that take place in private homes, somebody (be it relatives, friends, or 
neighbours) must have an idea of what is going on. How do we get them to act upon the situation? 
 
Public information and education campaign 
The question is, are signals of exploitation being recognized, is it known that exploitative conduct can be 
punishable as THB, and where can one report abuses? A public information and education campaign by 
the government is recommended to raise awareness of the phenomenon of THB. In the first report BNRM 
made such an appeal to the Dutch government with respect to exploitation within the sex industry. The 
fact that in the Netherlands sexual services from consenting adults can be bought freely and without 
breaking any law, does not relieve clients from the responsibility to buy these services only in the 
regulated sector, or from the responsibility to be vigilant even then. At the moment, an information and 
education campaign targeting (possible) clients of the sex industry, is in preparation. 
Such a campaign regarding THB for exploitation outside the sex industry is also needed. This is in fact 
what the UN Commission on the Status of Women also calls for in her resolution Eliminating demand for 
trafficked women and girls for all forms of exploitation: “to raise public awareness of the issue of 

                                          
11 These findings are relevant because a common feature among most irregular migrants in alien detention and 
victims of THB, is that they went abroad in order to improve their (economic) situation. Besides, although not all 
undocumented foreigners who end up in alien detention have experienced exploitative labour situtations, we know 
that some have.

trafficking in persons”.12 It is important to proclaim that exploitation can and will not be tolerated in our 
society. It has to be prevented when possible, and when it does occur nevertheless, it must be spotted and 
dealt with. 
 
 
Concluding remarks 

We plead for attention to trafficking for 'other forms of exploitation', without slackening in our efforts to 
tackle exploitation in the sex industry. The cases presented in this chapter illustrate that a variety of factors 
can lead to a situation in which a victim – male or female, adult or minor - provides work or services 
under the menace of some sort of penalty, be it physical harm, threats to denounce his or her illegal status 
to the authorities, or other forms of abuse or intimidation. In other words: it is not necessary for a victim to 
be held in captivity in order to speak of grossly exploitative labour situations. While extremely poor or 
hazardous working conditions do not as such constitute exploitation in the sense of THB, in combination 
with restriction of the victim's personal freedom, for instance due to debt bondage, they can represent a 
severe violation of human rights. A recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights13 shows that 
states that signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights do have the obligation to protect inhabitants 
from being held in slavery or servitude. In line with earlier jurisprudence, the Court judged that states, by 
virtue of art. 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are under the positive obligation to take 
measures in their national laws, that offer concrete and effective protection against violation of the rights 
warranted in art. 4 of that Declaration14 to anyone in their jurisdiction. This applies not only to violations 
that result from acts by a state or state bodies, but also to violations inflicted by private individuals. 

Still, the concept of exploitation in labour situations outside the sex industry is not crystal clear. In the 
Netherlands as well as in many other countries we do not know the exact dividing line between illegal 
employment and trafficking for exploitation outside the sex industry. In due course, additional 
jurisprudence (national and supra national) will hopefully bring more clarity. However, we do not have to 
wait for that. As BNRM recommended in its third report on THB, we need to strive for agreement on the 
scope of the term 'other forms of exploitation' on an international, at any rate European level. This may 
give prosecutors and judges a handle on future cases, as well as facilitate international cooperation in 
(police investigations of, and in possible extraditions in) trafficking cases. 

In conclusion, a remark about the people who are at stake: the victims. In the current political climate, 
undocumented migrants cannot count on much compassion in the Netherlands or in the rest of Europe. 
Great efforts are made to tackle illegality. In the Netherlands, for example, we have a governmental 
memorandum on undocumented migrants (Illegalennota, 2004), as well as a steering group on the 
approach of illegality, and a nationwide network of intervention teams that tackles moonlighting, social 
security and tax fraud, as well as employment of undocumented migrants. In such a repressive climate, it 
is crucial that the authorities involved recognize, regard and treat victims of THB, first and foremost, as 
victims of a crime, also when the exploitation took place outside the sex industry. This approach is 
legitimized, at least on paper: the above mentioned Illegalennota concerns the approach of illegality as 
well as the tackling of exploitation of undocumented migrants, and states that special attention should be

paid to victims of trafficking among people who are being encountered without a (valid) residence permit. 
In this respect it is also worth mentioning that, in the Netherlands, the so-called B9 regulation, which 
offers alien victims of THB the possibility of a temporary residence permit for the duration of the criminal 
investigation and the prosecution - similar provisions exist in Belgium and Germany - now also applies to 
victims who were exploited outside the sex industry. They too are entitled to shelter, medical assistance 
and legal aid. However, what these arrangements will look like in practice remains to be seen since most 
currently existing services are tailored to the needs of females who fall victim to exploitation in the sex 
industry. For instance, the shelters currently used to accommodate victims (mostly shelters for battered 
women) may be adequate for female victims of domestic slavery, but they are not suited for males who 
have been exploited in, for example, restaurants or agriculture.
