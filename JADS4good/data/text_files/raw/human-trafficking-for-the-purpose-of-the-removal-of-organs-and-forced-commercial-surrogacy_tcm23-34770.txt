1 Introduction
The issue of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal was addressed in the Fifth 
and Seventh report of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings.1 This report 
expands on the information in those two reports and describes recent developments in the 
Netherlands and in international legislation on human trafficking for organ removal and 
trafficking in human organs. In this section, after an update of the legal framework, there is 
a discussion of incidents involving human trafficking for organ removal, as well as a brief 
review of the investigation and prosecution of this offence. Other issues discussed here are 
the involvement of Dutch nationals in organ trafficking and organ tourism, as well as the 
recent debate on the commercialisation of the market for human organs.

The second part of the report is devoted to the connection between human trafficking and 
commercial surrogacy, a subject that has not been covered in any of the earlier reports on 
trafficking in human beings.

2 Human trafficking for the purpose of the 
removal of organs

2.1 Legal framework and changes in the legislation

Human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs has been a criminal offence 
under Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC) since 2005. According to Article 273f (1)
(1) DCC, any person who, by force, recruits, transports, moves, accommodates or shelters 
another person with the intention of removing that other person’s organs is guilty of a crime. 
A Dutch national who is guilty of human trafficking for organ removal in another country is 
also committing an offence by virtue of Article 273f DCC, provided, currently, that the offence 
is also punishable in the country concerned.2 Human trafficking for organ removal is based 
on involuntary donation, or the intention of obtaining an organ without the explicit consent 
of the donor. The voluntary donation of organs is regulated in the Netherlands in the Organ 
Donation Act (Wet op de Orgaandonatie). The most important conditions for organ donation 
laid down in that act are that the donor gives explicit, informed consent (Article 8) and that 
no payment should be made for the removal of the organ (Article 2). The intentional removal 
of an organ from a living person or after a person’s death without prior consent is a criminal 
offence under Article 32 of the Organ Donation Act, as is deliberately causing or encouraging 
a person to give permission to remove an organ during his or her lifetime in return for a 

1 NRM5, 2007, Ch. 9 and NRM7, 2009, Ch. 13.
2 The adoption of the EU Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting 

its victims (2011/36/EU), which expands extra-territorial jurisdiction with regard to human trafficking, will 
lead to the lapse of the requirement that the offence is also a criminal offence in the country where it is 
committed. A bill to implement this directive is currently pending before parliament (Parliamentary 
Documents II 2011/12, 33 309, no. 2).

payment that amounts to more than the costs incurred by the donor as a direct result of the 
removal of the organ. Persons who openly offer to pay a commercial fee for receipt of an 
organ or who openly put themselves forward as a donor or offer their services as a ‘mediator’ 
for a commercial fee are also liable to prosecution.

Since the appearance of the Seventh report, two amendments to the law, which are relevant 
for human trafficking for organ removal, have entered into force.

The Health Insurance Decree
In the Seventh report, there was a discussion of a case of organ tourism in which a Dutch 
kidney patient had received a transplant in Pakistan.3 Because the Health Insurance Act pro-
vided that the health insurer had to pay for the transplant regardless of whether the organ 
had been purchased, a Dutch health insurance company reimbursed the costs of the trans-
plantation.4 However, that conflicted with the ethical and legal norms adopted in the 
Netherlands: that there should not be a payment for donating an organ.5 In a letter of 3 
November 2008 to the Lower House of Parliament, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport 
announced his intention to “modify the law to the effect that in those cases where there is 
serious doubt about the ethical acceptability of a transplant the insurance company should 
refuse to pay for it”.6 The intention was implemented with the introduction of an amend-
ment of Article 2.4 (1) (c) of the Health Insurance Decree with effect from 1 January 2010.7 The 
article now provides that the costs of transplants outside the countries of the European 
Union and the countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area will 
not be reimbursed unless the organ is donated by a spouse, a registered partner or a blood 
relative of the insured person, the reasoning being that there will be no question of additio-
nal financial compensation in those cases.8

This amendment brings the policy on payment by health insurers for transplants more into 
line with the criminal nature of trafficking in organs9 and creates an additional obstacle for 
Dutch nationals who attempt to have a transplant for payment in another country. With 
regard to organ transplants in countries of the European Union and countries that are party 
to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, however, there is no rule requiring insu-
rance companies to refuse to pay in the event of serious doubts about the ethical acceptabi-
lity of a transplant. In those cases, reimbursement for the transplant depends on the terms of 
the policy.

Subsidy scheme for donation during life
Also worth mentioning is the Subsidy Scheme for donation during life, which entered into 
force on 1 June 2009.10 Under this scheme, the donor receives compensation for expenses 
that are a direct result of the donation and which are not reimbursed in any other way.11 This 
scheme has given the payment of expenses to donors a permanent character and anchored it 
more firmly in public law,12 thus removing an obstacle to donation during life.13

International developments
The common thread running through the European and international framework is the call 
on governments to adopt measures to remedy the problem of the shortage of available 
organs and reduce waiting lists for patients and to combat human trafficking for organ remo-
val.14 The following section briefly describes the international legal developments since the 
Seventh report (2009).

United Nations and Council of Europe
In 2009, the joint study by the United Nations and the Council of Europe entitled ‘Trafficking 
in organs, tissues and cells and trafficking in human beings for the purpose of the removal of 
organs’ was published.15 The study contained a number of conclusions and recommendati-
ons that can be summed up as follows:

•	 A distinction needs to be made between illegal trafficking in organs, tissues and cells and 
human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs.

•	 The prohibition of making financial gain from the body or its parts should be the para-
mount principle in relation to organ transplants.

•	 Organ donation needs to be promoted.
•	 Reliable data needs to be collected about trafficking in organs, tissues and cells and human 

trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs.
•	 There is a need for an internationally agreed definition of ‘trafficking in organs, tissues and 

cells’.

10 Regulation of the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport of 12 May 2009, no. GMT/IB/2929135, providing for 
reimbursement of costs for the donation of an organ during life, Government Gazette 2009, 97.

11 ‘On these grounds, for example, the donor qualifies for reimbursement of the medical costs for which 
compensation is not provided elsewhere, the individual’s personal contribution to the municipality for 
help in the household, the care of children or loss of income.’ Parliamentary Documents II 2010/11, 28 140, 
no. 77, p. 9. The subsidy scheme corresponds with Articles 2 and 7 of the Organ Donation Act, which states 
that consent given for the removal of an organ, given in return for payment amounting to more than the 
costs(including loss of income) incurred by the donor as a direct result of the removal of the organ, shall be 
invalid.

World Health Organisation (WHO)
Given the absence of generally accepted terminology and definitions, in November 2009 the 
‘Global Glossary of Terms and Definitions on Donation and Transplantation’ was published.16 
This Global Glossary is a compilation of existing and newly coined terms and basic definitions 
relating to the donation and transplantation of cells, tissues and organs. On 21 May 2010, the 
63rd World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA63.22, which endorsed the revised ver-
sion of the ‘WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation’.17 The 
resolution also called on member states to implement the Guiding Principles, promote 
altruistic donation, combat attempts to make financial gain from trafficking in organs and 
from transplant tourism, promote transparent and legitimate systems of allocating organs 
and tissues, improve the safety and effectiveness of donations and transplants, strengthen 
national and multinational organising and coordinating authorities and promote the col-
lection of data.18

European Union
While the Directive of the European Parliament and the Council of 7 July 2010 on standards 
for human organs intended for transplantation19 is primarily concerned with the quality and 
safety of organs, it does refer to unacceptable practices in relation to organ donation and 
transplantation, including trafficking in organs and human trafficking for the purpose of the 
removal of organs. The directive is intended to “contribute indirectly to combating organ 
trafficking through the establishment of competent authorities, the authorisation of trans-
plantation centres, the establishment of conditions of procurement and systems of 
traceability”.20 Although practice in the Netherlands already largely complies with the rules 
laid down in the directive, there is also a minor addition to the principle of voluntary and 
unpaid donation and the prohibition of trafficking in organs, since the amendment provides 
that the procurement of organs in a hospital must also not be for profit.21 The member states 
were required to transpose this directive into national law by 27 August 2012.22

endorsed by resolution WHA63.22, 21 May 2010. The presentation of the new WHO Guiding Principles on 
Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation was already discussed in NRM7, which said, among other 
things: “Guiding Principle 5 prescribes that cell, organ and tissue donation may only take place voluntarily 
– for altruistic reasons – and rejects the trade in these human body parts. Any costs incurred by the donor 
may be reimbursed.”

In the EU Directive on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings and protecting 
the victims of trafficking,23 the definition of human trafficking in the previous Council 
Framework Decision24 was expanded by adding human trafficking for the purpose of the 
removal of organs.

In April 2010, an EU-financed project on organ donation during life in Europe was launched.25 
The general objectives of the project are to identify practices in relation to donation during 
life in the member states, to investigate and promote donation during life as a possibility of 
increasing the availability of organs and to develop tools to improve the quality and safety of 
organ donations during life in Europe.

2.2 Incidents, investigation and prosecution

Although human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs has been a criminal 
offence under Article 273f DCC since 1 January 2005, little is known about the prevalence of 
this form of human trafficking in the Netherlands. It is also difficult to say whether this type 
of offence is committed by Dutch nationals abroad. As described in the Seventh report, three 
possible cases of human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs were reported in 
2006 and 2007.26 Since then, one additional case that might have involved human trafficking 
for the purposes of the removal of organs was reported to CoMensha in 2010. This case 
involved an Iranian political refugee who was smuggled to the Netherlands via Istanbul. In 
the Netherlands, he was locked in a room and threatened with organ removal. The man was 
able to escape and told his story to the police. A place was then found for him in a reception 
centre and an asylum application procedure was started. 

Although every victim or possible victim of human trafficking must be registered with 
CoMensha, no new victims of forced organ removal have been reported to CoMensha since 
that last case in 2010. However, the newspaper Trouw published an article in 2011 about a 
Chinese woman who was smuggled to the Netherlands where she was exploited in prostitu-
tion.27 The woman had a daughter in China whom she wanted to bring to the Netherlands. In 
exchange for her daughter’s journey, the woman had to surrender a kidney in China. After 
donating the organ, the woman returned to the Netherlands with her daughter, where she 
was again put to work as a prostitute in a massage parlour.

No suspect has ever been prosecuted for human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of 
organs in the Netherlands. In Belgium two cases involving the illegal removal of organs28 
have been reported to the public prosecution service, but there, too, there have been no 
prosecutions, according to the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism.29

Although human trafficking for the purposes of the removal of organs is a criminal offence 
in many countries, in most countries there is little awareness of this form of crime or exper-
tise in investigating and prosecuting what has proved a very complex offence.30 For example, 
there was a case in South Africa where medical staff were found guilty of performing more 
than 100 illegal kidney transplantations, but it took seven years before the public prosecuti-
on service had collected enough evidence to prosecute the suspects.31 Because of the very 
small number of prosecutions for human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs 
worldwide, there is scarcely any case-law about this form of crime.32

2.3 Trafficking in organs and organ tourism

The basic principle for voluntary organ donation in the Netherlands is that the organs should 
not be donated for payment.33 However, the shortage of organs could undermine this princi-
ple. On the one hand, payment for an organ could give people an incentive to donate an 
organ while they are alive, thus reducing the shortage of organs. On the other hand, the risk 
of a trade in organs34 is that the commercialisation of organs could endanger the voluntary 
nature of donation,35 and a market in organs could encourage human traffickers to exploit 
people for that purpose. After all, wherever there is money to be made, there is the risk of 
exploitation.

Scale of organ trafficking and organ tourism
Although there is still no clear picture of the scale of organ trafficking and organ 
tourism in the Netherlands and by Dutch nationals abroad, the situation is coming 
into sharper relief. Public offers of and requests for organs seem to occur increa-
singly frequently, while doctors also seem to find it easier to discuss possible cases 
of organ tourism that they encounter during their work, and more research is 
being conducted into the scale of trafficking in organs and organ tourism.36

Some people offer their kidney on the Internet or in the newspaper.37 At the 
beginning of 2011, the Algemeen Dagblad reported that at least 24 people had 
offered their kidneys for sale in advertisements on websites like Marktplaats and 
Speurders (the advertisements are usually removed from the websites after a 
while).38 In the advertisements the donors asked for remuneration and sometimes 
mentioned a specific amount, such as of 40,000 or 60,000 euro.39 Advertisements 
are also sometimes placed by kidney patients looking for an organ.40

At the beginning of 2011, there was an uproar about organ tourism by Dutch 
nationals in Belgium. It was reported that 28 Dutch nationals who were on a 
waiting list in Belgium had received Belgian organ transplants in 2010.41 Member of 
Parliament Dijkstra (D66) submitted questions on the matter to the Minister of 
Health, Welfare and Sport.42 However, this case did not involve payment for 
organs.

In the free newspaper Metro,43 surgeon Frank Dor said that every year there are 
probably between five and ten Dutch people who buy kidneys in Turkey or Israel. 
These kidneys are reportedly taken from young people from Moldavia and Kosovo, 
who are enticed to these countries under the guise of finding ‘work’ and then have 
their residence papers confiscated. The only way they can get their passports back 
is to surrender a kidney, according to Dor.

The disappearance of a person’s name from a waiting list for an organ transplant for reasons 
that are unclear could be an indication that they have had a questionable transplant. Until 
recently, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport was unable to say how many people disap-

peared from waiting lists for organ transplants. Following a recommendation by the NRM,44 
the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport conducted a study into the number of people disap-
pearing from the waiting lists and reported her findings to the NRM in a letter.45 The minister 
made enquiries at Eurotransplant, the agency that keeps records of why people remove their 
names from a waiting list in the Netherlands. One of the reasons that can be given, apart 
from ‘other’ or ‘improvement or deterioration in condition’, is ‘transplant outside a 
Eurotransplant country’. This reason was given in two instances in 2010. Aware of the possi-
bility that the real reason for leaving a waiting list was not given, the minister then consulted 
the Dutch Transplantation Foundation (NTS), which had made enquiries at the eight Dutch 
kidney transplant centres in 2008 about transplant tourism in the Netherlands. Five cases 
were reported in the period 2005-2007. The NTS has not repeated its study since 200846 and 
the minister sees no reason to conduct a further study into the reasons why people remove 
their names for the waiting lists for kidney transplants.47

Addressing the shortage of donors
The Netherlands still faces a shortage of donors,48 which is the driving force behind traffic-
king in organs and human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs,49 so it is 
important to have a clear picture of how the government intends to address the donor 
shortage.

In 2008, the Organ Donation Coordination Group drew up the Master Plan for Organ 
Donation.50 The Coordination Group investigated the option of providing financial incen-
tives for donation during life, but rejected this option because there was insufficient public 
support and because of ethical and legal considerations.51 Although, according to the 
Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, progress had been made in other areas, such as the 
approach in hospitals, public information and donation during life, in response to the Organ 
Donation Master Plan,52 those efforts have not resolved the shortage of donors. In a reaction 

44 The recommendation was made during a meeting of the NRM with the Minister of Health, Welfare and 
Sport, 27 September 2011.

45 Letter from the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport to NRM, 11 May 2012.
46 Information received in a telephone call from NTS, 12 July 2012.
47 In the letter of 11 May, the Minister gives as reasons the small number of reports in the period 2005-2007, 

the amendment of the Health Insurance Act (see section 2.1) and the measures currently being taken by 
the Council of Europe.

48 According to the 2011 annual report of the Dutch Transplantation Foundation, on 31 December 2011 there 
were 1311 patients on the waiting list for an organ (NTS, 2012). According to the Kidney Foundation, on 31 
December 2011 there were 883 people on the waiting list for a donor kidney. Kidney patients have to wait 
an average of just over four years for a transplant: http://www.nierstichting.nl/asset/folders/feiten-
cijfers2011. pdf (last consulted on 12 July 2012). Every year, between 100 and 200 people die while they are

to this conclusion, members of parliament held talks with the minister.53 During that mee-
ting MP Dijkstra announced that D66 would submit a bill providing for the introduction of 
an active donor registration system (ADR system).54 Dijkstra presented her private member’s 
bill in August.55 The ADR system leaves people free to choose whether to become a donor, but 
requires the choice to be registered.56 The Organ Donation Coordination Group had recom-
mended in the Organ Donation Master Plan that the Netherlands should switch to this sys-
tem.57 However, the minister said that she regarded the assumption that a person who does 
not register an objection wishes to be a donor as an infringement of the right to self-determi-
nation, which could only be justified if that infringement would yield an undeniable and 
substantial increase in the number of donors.58 According to her, the uncertainties about the 
effect of a change in the system are too great to justify making such a change.59

Principle of non-commerciality
Dutch legislation takes a clear stand against commercial payments for organ donation.60 In 
international treaties and legislation, altruism is also regarded as the decisive factor for organ 
donation.61 Donation should be voluntary and not for financial gain. Various arguments can 
be made in favour of the non-commerciality principle, one of which is that paying for bodily 
materials would transform them into commodities, which would constitute a violation of 
human dignity.62 Another argument is that the payment would tempt donors to conceal 
diseases and, hence, endanger the safety and quality of donation.63 With regard to human 
trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs, however, the most important factor is 
that commercialisation could endanger the voluntary nature of organ donation. In the litera-
ture, the argument made is that social determinants (poverty, debt, a vulnerable social posi-
tion or illiteracy on the part of the donor) could reflect the social inequality between donor

and recipient and, consequently, compel the sale of organs.64 Accordingly, the donor would 
have no autonomy or freedom of choice and the situation would usually involve coercion 
and exploitation.65 There are other studies that suggest that criminalising the commercialisa-
tion of organ donation could promote human trafficking,66 because there would be a greater 
opportunity for exploitation and abuse if supplying desperately wanted goods (in this case, 
organs) were made illegal.67

Because of the shortage of organs, there are growing calls to abolish the prohibition of pay-
ments for organs. In 2011, Ingrid Geesink and Chantal Steegers (two researchers at the 
Rathenau Institute) published ‘Nier te koop – Baarmoeder te huur’,68 a book that explores the 
worldwide market in bodily materials. Their conclusion was that parts of our body are worth 
money and that Dutch nationals travel abroad to buy them. The authors believe that this 
forces us to revise our ideas about payment and donation, and they refer in their book to 
alternative forms of donation and possible financial incentives. One form of remuneration 
for organ donors that they suggest is a lifetime exemption from health insurance premiums,69 
a proposal that had already been made in 2007 by the Council for Public Health and Health 
Care (RVZ) as an appropriate form of remuneration.70 The journal Medisch Contact publis-
hed an article entitled ‘Wet tegen orgaanhandel is dode letter’ [‘Act to prevent organ trade is 
a dead letter’], which also proposed this form of remuneration.71 Dutch doctors, who are 
confronted with patients who have had a kidney transplant abroad and suspect that the kid-
ney came from a paid donor, do not feel that it is their responsibility to act as investigating 
officers, and their duty of professional confidentiality and doctor-patient privilege exempts 
them from the requirement to report crimes that may have been committed by their patients. 
For these reasons, possible cases of transplant tourism are not reported and registered, and 
therefore go unpunished. As a result, illegal trafficking in organs continues. The authors of 
the article therefore advocate that the government should consider regulating the market in 
organs rather than banning payment for them. According to them, there is no conflict 
between payment and voluntariness. Proper screening and a reward that is not provided at 
once (and also not given in cash), such as a lifelong exemption from health insurance premi-
ums, would prevent involuntary donation. Research shows that the public also regards 
exemption from health insurance premiums as the most acceptable form of 
remuneration.72

Parliament held a debate in response to the book ‘Nier te koop – Baarmoeder te huur’.73 In a 
letter dated 19 January 2012, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport announced that she 
would present her analysis of the book and her position on the principle of non-commercia-
lity in the first quarter of 2012.74 Because of the controversial nature of the subject, the state-
ment of the government’s position on the issue has been left to the next government.75

2.4 Problems and recommendations

This chapter has described recent developments in the Netherlands and in international 
legislation relating to human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs and traf-
ficking in organs. The analysis leads to the following list of bottlenecks and the issues that 
require special attention.

•	 There are very few known cases of human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of 
organs in the Netherlands or by Dutch nationals. However, there is a need to remain alert 
because there seems to be a growing market in organs, due in part to the Internet and the 
globalisation of society.

•	 Commercialisation of organ donations could endanger the voluntary nature of donation. 
Where these practices occur, there is therefore a risk of human trafficking for the purpose 
of the removal of organs. It is important to learn more about the scale of organ trafficking 
and organ tourism. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport could play a prominent role 
in this.

•	 As already mentioned in the Seventh report, in order to gain a clear picture of the scale of 
trafficking in organs and organ tourism it is necessary to secure the help and alertness of 
the relevant facilitating, supporting and executive agencies, such as medical personnel 
and health insurers.76 An agency should be established to make it easier to report and regis-
ter possible cases of organ tourism and trafficking in organs.

73 On 22 March 2011, members of parliament had a meeting with the Rathenau Institute to discuss the trade 
in bodily materials. During the debate in parliament on organ donation on 24 March 2011, members of 
parliament asked the Minister for a reaction to the Rathenau Institute’s book ‘Nier te koop – Baarmoeder 
te huur’.

•	 The disappearance of a person’s name from the waiting list for an organ transplant for 
vague reasons could be an indication that they have had a questionable transplant. 
Eurotransplant keeps records of the reasons why people remove their names from a wai-
ting list. In 2010, this happened twice because the transplant could be performed outside 
a Eurotransplant country. Enquiries by NTS at kidney transplant centres in 2008 identified 
five cases of transplant tourism in the period 2005-2007. Because of the small numbers 
involved, no further research has been conducted since these studies in 2010 and 2008. The 
research should be repeated to gain an overview of the current situation.

•	 There are calls from various quarters for financial incentives for organ donation. A number 
of points need to be considered in this context. Financial incentives could alleviate the 
shortage of organs and, hence the chance of human trafficking for the purpose of the 
removal of organs. However, financial incentives for organ donation would also make 
organ donation a commercial activity and create a market for organs, which would, in 
itself, carry the risk of human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs. That risk 
could be avoided by offering donors an exemption from health insurance premiums rather 
than a direct monetary reward.

•	 Trafficking in organs and human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs are 
not constrained by national borders. It is important for states to try to reach new joint 
solutions and, where possible, coordinate policies and strategies with respect to organ 
donation, trafficking in organs and human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of 
organs.

3 Does forced surrogacy constitute human 
trafficking?

The previous sections discussed trafficking in organs and human trafficking for the purpose 
of the removal of organs in the context of the ‘classical organs’, such as kidneys, heart, lungs 
and liver. Because of the severe shortage of these organs, patients seem to be willing to pay 
for them. In addition to the trade in these ‘classical organs’, however, a market is also gro-
wing for other parts of the body.77

One such market is the demand for surrogate mothers. Commercial surrogacy is increasingly 
common, partly as a result of developments like the Internet, the globalisation of society and 
advances in procreation techniques.78 The policy in the Netherlands is aimed at preventing 
the spread of commercial surrogacy, and accordingly, behaviour that promotes supply and 
demand in relation to surrogacy has been made a criminal offence.79 Surrogacy itself is not a 
criminal offence.

3.1 Legal framework

For parents who would like their own genetic child, high-tech surrogacy is permitted under 
very strict conditions80 at the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre.81 This form of surrogacy is very 
rare in the Netherlands, as is apparent from the fact that only five children have been born 
through the use of high-tech surrogacy at the VUMC in the last few years.82

In addition to the stringent requirements for surrogate motherhood in the Netherlands, the 
requirements for the donation of eggs and semen were also tightened up in 2004, with the 
entry into force of the Artificial Insemination (Donor Data) Act. The act provides that every 

77 On this point, see Geesink & Steegers, 2011.

500 VI, no. 83.
79 Parliamentary Documents II 2011-2012, 33 000 VI, no. 69. Criminalisation in Arts. 151b and 151c DCC.
80 The rules were drawn up by the Dutch Association of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Conditions are that 

there must be an indication that the prospective mother has a serious medical condition, the surrogate 
mother must be known to the prospective parents, and the surrogate mother must have a complete 
family of her own. Surrogacy is only permitted for altruistic reasons, and there is a strict medical and 
psychological selection procedure (Geesink and Steegers, 2011, p. 125). A further requirement is that the 
genetic material must come from the two prospective parents (Parliamentary Documents II2011-2012, 33 
000 VI, no. 69).

81 With high-tech surrogacy, an embryo created by IVF is inserted in the surrogate mother. That embryo may 
be related wholly or partially to the prospective parents, or not at all. The surrogate is not genetically 
related to the child.

82 Parliamentary Documents II 2011-2012, 33 000 VI, no. 69, p. 2. In the period 1997-2004, 500 couples 
requested information about high-tech surrogacy, of whom 202 couples were screened, but only 35 could 
start an IVF procedure. This led to the birth of 16 children. See Winkel, Roumenen&Dermout, 2010.



18 |  BNRM Human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs and forced commercial surrogacy

child from the age of 16 is entitled to know who his or her biological parent is. The prohibi-
tion of the anonymous donation of eggs and semen in this law has led to a severe shortage of 
sperm donors.83

Foreign commercial surrogacy
While high-tech surrogacy is only available to a very small number of people in the 
Netherlands, and only if both prospective parents can provide their own genetic 
material, the rules on surrogate motherhood are less stringent in some other 
countries. In countries like the United States, India and the Ukraine, for example, 
commercial high-tech surrogacy is permitted and the purchase of eggs and semen 
is legal. With globalisation, it is possible for prospective parents in the Netherlands 
to buy an egg in the United States, order semen from Cryos (the commercial 
spermbank in Denmark) and have them borne by an Indian surrogate mother 
through IVF with the help of high-tech surrogacy.

In a letter dated 16 December 2011, the State Secretary for Security and Justice 
said: “Globalisation and the Internet provide easier access to the services that are 
offered abroad. The low costs in India and the Ukraine are another important 
factor. This makes a route via those countries ‘attractive’.”84 The total cost for a 
baby via high-tech commercial surrogacy comes to between 25,000 and 30,000 
dollars in India,85 compared with 150,000 dollars in the United States.86

Intermediary companies operate in the international ‘baby market’, bringing 
together donors, parents, surrogate mothers and fertility clinics and making the 
legal arrangements. Although donors, surrogate mothers and fertility clinics are 
financially compensated for their services, according to Geesink and Steegers it is 
the intermediary companies that make the greatest profits from the ‘baby 
market’.87

When it comes to commercial surrogacy, the question is to what extent the surrogate mothers 
are acting voluntarily. As with trafficking in organs, social determinants such as poverty, debt, 
a vulnerable social position and illiteracy can force a woman to become a surrogate mother. 
Jyotsna Gupta, a senior lecturer in gender studies and diversity at the University of Utrecht, 
argues that Indian surrogate mothers are usually under enormous pressure from their hus-

83 Geesink & Steegers, 2011, p. 82. In part to address the shortage of donors, on 2 April 2012 the UMC Utrecht 
started recruiting egg donors as a first step towards creating a Dutch egg bank. See: ‘Eerste stap 
Nederlandse eicelbank’[First step towards Dutch egg bank], De Telegraaf, 2 April 2012.

band and family.88 Furthermore, particularly in the poorer countries, the rights of surrogate 
mothers are not always properly protected89 and most of the money goes to the mediators 
and doctors.90 In other words, with commercial surrogacy, there is a risk that women are 
forced to become surrogates and are exploited in that role. Dr. Roel Schats, chief medical 
officer of the IVF centre of the VU Medical Centre, goes so far as to argue that “it is a form of 
modern slavery to use an Indian woman as a breeding machine without the benefit of any 
form of care”.91

This raises the question of whether forced surrogacy could, or should, fall within the scope of 
the Dutch human trafficking article, which would require the elements of the offence (as 
defined in Article 273f DCC) to be met. The following sections discuss each element of that 
offence in turn.

Conduct
To meet the definition of the offence in Article 273f (1)(1) DCC, there first has to be one of the 
actions listed in that sub-section.92 Depending on the specific situation, commercial sur-
rogacy could involve the recruitment of the surrogate mother by the mediating agency. Many 
Indian surrogate mothers are also housed in special centres for all or part of the pregnancy. 
In such cases, one or more of the actions referred to in Article 273f (1)(1) DCC are involved.

Coercion
For forced surrogacy to qualify as human trafficking, one of the means of coercion listed in 
section 1, subsection 1 has to be used. Three factors can play a role in determining whether 
coercion is used in commercial surrogacy:

The first factor is whether a foreign surrogate mother who is paid to bear a child for Dutch 
parents has personally chosen to be a surrogate. For example, if pressure is exerted on the 
woman by her husband, or if women living in poverty are offered a large sum of money to 
become a surrogate, that could constitute coercion through the use of force or misuse of a 
vulnerable position.

Another factor is whether it is possible for the potential surrogate to change her mind. If the 
contract with the mediating agency has been signed but conception has not yet taken place, 
can the potential surrogate still retract her decision?93 If not, this could constitute coercion.

88 Te huur’ [To let], Nederlands Dagblad, 24 December 2010.
89 After a miscarriage, for example, the surrogate receives no more than the monthly payment up to that 

time. See the article ‘Te huur’, Nederlands Dagblad, 24 December 2010.
90 Geesink & Steegers, 2011, p. 113. According to the article ‘Te huur’, Nederlands Dagblad, 24 December 2010, 

the doctors exploit the surrogates.

92 These actions are recruiting, transporting, moving, accommodating and sheltering.
93 For example, the consent given for the donation of an organ during life can always be revoked pursuant to 

Article 6 of the Organ Donation Act.



20 |  BNRM Human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs and forced commercial surrogacy

A final factor is the degree to which the surrogate mother, after conception, is free to spend 
the period of her pregnancy as she wishes. ‘Google baby’, a documentary about Indian sur-
rogate mothers, included a film of a centre where surrogate mothers were living. Dozens of 
these surrogate mothers, whose pregnancies were at an advanced stage, were living in a large 
dormitory. They were required to stay in bed and take certain medication. All of the children 
were delivered before the due date by Caesarean section. It is legitimate to ask to what extent 
these women were free to spend their pregnancy in another way or whether this was a form 
of coercion.

Exploitation
Exploitation – and the intention to exploit – is the key to the article on human trafficking. 
The various forms of exploitation are defined in section 2 of Article 273f DCC. Commercial 
surrogacy is not specified as a form of exploitation in this article. However, that does not 
mean that it could not fall within the scope of the human trafficking article, since the list of 
forms of exploitation in section 2 is not exhaustive. Surrogate motherhood could be defined 
as the forced or induced performance of services, a form of exploitation that is included in 
section 2. The service the surrogate mother is forced to perform in that case is carrying and 
bearing the child.

If it is assumed that surrogacy could be regarded as being forced to perform a service, the 
question remains: under what circumstances would it involve exploitation? Exploitation 
involves a violation of fundamental rights, so it could be argued that forced commercial sur-
rogacy is a violation of the right to bodily integrity, since the forced insertion of the embryo 
into the womb and any physical discomfort during the pregnancy and the delivery could be 
seen as a violation of bodily integrity. The right to human dignity could also be at risk if a 
woman is forced to be a surrogate. The number of high-tech pregnancies that a surrogate 
mother has gone through for the purposes of commercial surrogacy could also be an indica-
tion of exploitation.94

Another factor that could play a role in deciding whether there is exploitation is the econo-
mic benefit gained from the surrogacy. Although the surrogate mother receives financial 
compensation in the case of commercial surrogacy, a large share of the money paid by the 
prospective parents goes to the agency that mediates in surrogacy. In India the surrogate 
mother bears the risks; if there are complications or health problems during the pregnancy 
or if the pregnancy or delivery leads to the death of the surrogate mother, neither the clinic 
nor the prospective parents are liable.95 A surrogate mother who has a miscarriage receives 
no payment96 or is only paid for the term of the pregnancy up to that point. It is therefore 

94 The some women undergo an extremely large number of high-tech surrogacies is apparent, for example, 
from the report ‘47-jarige zwanger van negende en tiende kind’ [47-year-old pregnant with ninth and 
tenth child], www.nu.nl, 29 February 2012, in which a 47-year-old British surrogate mother was pregnant 
with twins, her ninth and tenth babies.

possible for a surrogate mother to be worse off physically and financially after a pregnancy 
with complications or after a miscarriage than she was before.97

In conclusion, it can be argued that, under certain circumstances, surrogacy could constitute 
exploitation. An important indication of exploitation would be if the financial and health 
risks are entirely or largely borne by the surrogate mother.

3.2 Offenders, victims and jurisdiction

Based on the conclusion that under certain circumstances surrogacy could fall within the 
scope of Article 273f DCC, the question is, what consequences could that have in practice? 
First and foremost, it is important to establish who can be regarded as the offender – i.e., the 
exploiter/human trafficker – if forced surrogacy can be described as human trafficking. Is it 
the doctors, the prospective parents, the man who ‘instructs’ his wife to become a surrogate 
mother? Or is the mediator the human trafficker? Depending on the specific circumstances, 
it seems evident that in most cases of forced commercial surrogacy it is the mediating agency 
and/or the spouse of the surrogate who exercises the coercive pressure and exploits the sur-
rogate mother. Although the prospective parents could also be involved in the exploitation 
of the surrogate mother, if a situation can in fact be described as human trafficking, their role 
is more that of consumer or customer rather than exploiter. In that sense, a comparison can 
be made with other forms of human trafficking: the customers are not the human traffickers 
in the case of forced organ donation, sexual exploitation in prostitution or labour exploita-
tion. As such they do not fall under the definition of the offence in Article 273f DCC. Doctors, 
and sometimes lawyers, are also involved in forced commercial surrogacy. In that sense, they 
could be regarded as facilitators but seldom as co-offenders or conspirators in human traf-
ficking. The role they play in the human trafficking process in such cases can be compared 
with that of taxi drivers, administrative offices or operators of window prostitution in other 
forms of exploitation. As facilitators, they enable the exploitation but do not play an active 
part in it. However, it could be argued that if they wilfully profit from the exploitation of 
another person, they could also be prosecuted as human traffickers, since that conduct is 
punishable under Article 273f (6) DCC.

Obviously, the victim in the case of forced commercial surrogacy is the surrogate mother. 
Human trafficking is about exploitation and the person exploited in this case is the surroga-
te. Although the term ‘human trafficking’ can be confusing in the sense that to some people 
it implies that people are traded, that is a misapprehension. It follows from this that the baby 

97 Similar problems also arise with paid organ donation abroad. See NRM7, pp. 581-582.



22 |  BNRM Human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs and forced commercial surrogacy

born from the forced surrogacy is not the victim of human trafficking98 when there is no 
intention to exploit the baby.99

Assuming that forced commercial surrogacy can constitute human trafficking and that, in 
that case, the mediating agency and/or the spouse who forces his wife to act as a surrogate 
can be regarded as the human trafficker, it is important to establish whether these facts can 
be prosecuted in the Netherlands under Article 273f DCC.

Forced commercial surrogacy appears to occur only outside the Netherlands. Because pro-
moting the supply and demand for surrogacy has been made a criminal offence in the 
Netherlands, the agency that does so cannot be Dutch. This means that the offence does not 
take place in the Netherlands and that the offenders and victims are not Dutch nationals and 
do not reside in the Netherlands. The prospective parents are the only connection with the 
Netherlands, but as already noted they cannot be regarded as offenders for the purposes of 
human trafficking. This leads to the conclusion that, generally speaking, the Netherlands will 
have no jurisdiction to prosecute.

3.3 Problems and recommendations

•	 As already explained, the policy in the Netherlands is aimed at preventing commercial sur-
rogacy, and its promotion is a criminal offence in this country. Although high-tech sur-
rogacy is permitted, it is subject to strict conditions, which means that the number of pros-
pective parents with access to it in the Netherlands is very small. The Minister of Health, 
Welfare and Sport is currently reviewing the requirements for high-tech surrogacy and was 
originally due to send a position paper on the issue to parliament in the first quarter of 
2012,100 but because the subject was declared controversial after the fall of the government, 
the statement of the government’s position has been left to the next government.101 A 
more flexible regime for high-tech surrogacy in the Netherlands might reduce the demand 
for surrogacy abroad, but it has not yet reached that point, and at the moment, the option 
of using a foreign surrogate mother is attractive to prospective parents in the Netherlands.

98 On this point, see also Boele-Woelki et al., 2011, p. 45 about the case of ‘baby Donna’: “The Public 
Prosecution Service concluded that the Dutch foster parents, by sheltering Donna, did not commit other 
criminal offences, for example human trafficking by the prospective parents. In the view of the Public 
Prosecution Service, there was no question of this because the foster parents did not act with the intention 
of exploiting the child.”

99 In fact, the Belgian newspaper De Standaard published an article containing allegations that in a Nigerian 
‘baby factory’ pregnant teenagers were forced to surrender their child and that the babies then entered 
human trafficking circuits for child labour and child prostitution. See: ‘Nigeriaanse ‘babyfabriek’ opgerold’ 
[Nigerian ‘baby factory’ shut down], De Standaard, 3 June 2011. In such a case, the babies would be victims 
of human trafficking.

•	 The large differences between countries in the price of surrogacy could also prompt pros-
pective parents to opt, financial reasons, for surrogacy in a country where the rights of the 
surrogate mother are less well protected. That could promote exploitation. Although, in 
this case, the prospective parents are not guilty of exploitation or human trafficking in a 
legal sense, they are involved in it (directly or indirectly). It is therefore legitimate to ask 
whether the Dutch government does not have an obligation to prevent prospective Dutch 
parents from using surrogates in countries where the rights of surrogate mothers are not 
properly safeguarded (thereby creating the risk of exploitation). Current policy seems in no 
way geared to this, since the State Secretary for Safety and Justice actually announced in his 
letter of 16 December 2011 that he did not intend to make any decision concerning the 
compensation of expenses that foreign surrogate mothers receive or the medical costs that 
the organisations charge in the case of international surrogacy.102

•	 A first step in discouraging surrogacy in high-risk countries, such as India, would be to 
provide good information to prospective parents. Although the State Secretary announced 
that the government would provide information about surrogacy in the Netherlands and 
abroad,103 the intention seems mainly to be to provide information about the rules and 
procedures concerning legal parenthood rather than information about the risks of 
exploitation of surrogate mothers. It is recommended that the information for prospective 
parents also explicitly refer to the risks of exploitation of the surrogate mother, and that 
prospective parents should be discouraged from going along with these practices.

•	 An idea that goes further than providing information is the regulation of international 
surrogacy. Just as there are rules for adoption, international surrogacy could be regulated. 
When it comes to high-tech surrogacy, in particular, where the prospective parents are not 
the genetic parents, it is questionable whether it is any different to adoption.104 In both 
cases, the child is not the parent’s own genetic child. The State Secretary for Security and 
Justice has therefore also announced that surrogacy in other countries will, in future, be 
recognised by the Netherlands only if at least one of the prospective parents is genetically 
related to the child and the identity of the child’s other genetic parent is known.105 If that is 
not the case, the appropriate path is through adoption. During the Hague Conference on 
International Private Law (HCCH) in April 2012, there was a discussion of the possibility 
and desirability of a global convention on surrogacy.106 It is recommended that the human

profit motive’ cannot be properly enforced in practice, in part because there is no uniform international 
definition of profit and the evidence of a profit motive is difficult to gather.

investigating the scale and nature of the problems under international private law that arise from 
international surrogacy agreements. The final report is expected in 2014. See: Hague Conference of Private 
International Law, Council on General Affairs and Policy of the Conference (17-20 April 2012), ‘Conclusions 
and Recommendations adopted by the Council’, 2012.

trafficking aspects in relation to surrogate mothers be addressed during the negotiations 
on that convention. The measures proposed by the State Secretary still have to be debated 
in parliament, and that debate will provide a basis for further discussion. It is important 
for the human trafficking aspects of commercial high-tech surrogacy to be addressed 
during those discussions.
