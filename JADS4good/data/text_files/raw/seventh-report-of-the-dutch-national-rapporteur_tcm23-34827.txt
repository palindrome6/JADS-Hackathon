Foreword

Take an everyday session of the children’s court. There are three cases: a request to remove 
young children from the custody of parents who are being held on suspicion of human traf-
ficking,	a	petition	for	the	placement	in	a	closed	shelter	of	a	14-year-old	girl	with	‘indications	
of problems with a loverboy’ and a request for placement in a closed shelter of a 16-year-old 
boy who had bought a weapon out of fear for his sister’s loverboy. Sessions like these are not 
isolated	incidents	and	illustrate	that	human	trafficking	is	not	solely	a	matter	of	criminal	law	
and calls for wider expertise than has been accumulated in criminal law. The phenomenon 
has a far wider impact and consequently threatens to become uncontrollable. Anyone can be 
confronted	with	human	trafficking	in	one	of	its	various	manifestations,	even	organisations	
and professionals that one would not normally think of in connection with the problem. This 
is	what	makes	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking	so	complicated.

This seventh report is thicker than ever and covers a wide range of subjects. It also contains 
47 recommendations for various actors. The recommendations differ in terms of their ur-
gency and complexity. I would like to mention just a few of them.

In my view, providing adequate care for victims remains an area of concern. Concern about 
the lack of capacity and at the delay in starting the pilot project with category-oriented shel-
ter.	Besides	creating	sufficient	capacity,	the	type	of	shelter	and	care	provided	for	each	distinct	
group of victims is very important. Regardless of where they come from, victims are entitled 
to shelter and care and should be treated as victims. In other words, they should not be held, 
even temporarily, at Schiphol, by the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers 
(COA, in aliens detention centres, in tents or at police stations. Special facilities should also 
be created for Dutch victims who are minors, usually victims of loverboys, either as part of 
the pilot project or separately. After all, a national strategy for caring for this category of 
victim should have been formulated long ago embracing key aspects such as a pedagogical 
climate, safety, small groups and education. In my view, primary responsibility for this lies 
with the Minister for Youth and Family and there should have been no delay due to problems 
in securing agreement between ministries.

For	the	first	time	extensive	research	has	been	conducted	into	the	case-law	concerning	exploi-
tation in the sex industry. One thing that had cearly emerged from this research is that the 
subject is complex, and not merely the legal aspects. Hence the recommendation that judges 
should specialise in this area, as the public prosecution service and the police have already 
done.	Success	in	tackling	human	trafficking	does	not	stop	at	prosecution.

The judiciary should also engage in a dialogue on the appropriate sentences for this very 
serious offence. In the so-called Sneep judgment, one of the few judgments in which a spe-
cific	benchmark	has	been	mentioned,	the	judge	adopted	a	sentence	of	eight	to	ten	months

in prison for each victim and described a period of exploitation of nine months as relatively 
short.	Do	we	find	that	short?	It	seems	to	me	that	it	is	at	least	debatable.	Another	question	
worth	considering	is	whether	the	Dutch	prostitution	policy	influences	decisions	on	whether	
or not the victim entered prostitution of her own free will. That is the impression to emerge 
from the judgments that were studied and it is worrying.

The last two reports devoted special attention to the development of case-law concerning 
exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry. The trend is very import for the investiga-
tion	and	prosecution	of	this	type	of	human-trafficking	case.	This	report	includes	an	analysis	
of the twelve judgments rendered in this type of case up to now. Although the jurisprudence 
is	not	yet	fully	fleshed	out	–	the	Supreme	Court	will	probably	issue	its	first	ruling	on	other	
forms of exploitation at the end of November of this year – a number of trends are emerging. 
A striking feature is that more subtle forms of compulsion, such as abuse of a vulnerable 
position, seem to cause the most problems. This falls under the English term coerced labour 
by contrast with forced labour, which involve more serious forms of compulsion or violence. 
But even the more subtle forms of coercion are covered by article 273f of the Dutch Criminal 
Code. As already mentioned in the sixth report, decisions in these cases should be guided by 
international legislation.

Of the three Ps, prevention, prosecution and protection, prevention remains the most rele-
vant,	since	every	victim	is	one	too	many.	But	prevention	is	also	the	most	difficult	P.	There	are	
projects dedicated to prevention and schools are increasingly coming to the realisation that 
they	also	have	a	responsibility	in	this	regard,	but	it	remains	difficult	to	put	it	into	practice.	It	
is important to focus heavily on developing projects geared to prevention, but unfortunately 
that has not proved adequate up to now. More needs to be done. In my view, particularly in 
loverboy cases the police and the public prosecution service should concentrate more on the 
‘grooming’ period, the period when victims are recruited, by actively prosecuting attempted 
human	trafficking	and	so	preventing	the	exploitation	from	actually	taking	place.

This report also refers to a fourth P: the P for partnership. Partnership with private organi-
sations,	particularly	in	fighting	and	raising	awareness	of	human	trafficking	outside	the	sex	
industry, with NGOs and, at EU level, with countries outside the European Union. The 
Koolvis case is a good example of a successful partnership between the Netherlands and Ni-
geria, the country of origin of both the defendants and the victims in the case. Nevertheless, 
a word of caution is appropriate here. With a human rights approach to tackling human traf-
ficking,	the	possible	effect	measures	could	have	on	human	rights	must	be	considered	before	
any steps are taken and collateral damage must be avoided as far as possible.

In April 2010, BNRM will celebrate its 10th anniversary. The occasion will be marked next 
October	on	the	European	Day	against	Human	Trafficking.	Unfortunately,	ten	years	of	work	
by the BNRM does not mean that the phenomenon is declining or disappearing. It is how-
ever	becoming	more	visible.	This	report	shows	that	tackling	human	trafficking	is	a	priority	
in the Netherlands, that a lot is being done to prevent it and some success is being achieved.

But	human	trafficking	remains	extremely	difficult	to	control,	both	in	the	sex	industry	and	in	
other sectors and the 47 recommendations that are made indicate that there is still a lot that 
can	and	must	be	improved	in	the	fight	against	human	trafficking.	I	hope	that	my	report	and	
my recommendations will help to achieve that.

Various institutions and individuals contributed to this report. BNRM is grateful to the 
LOVS, the IND, CoMensha, and the CJIB for their cooperation and for providing data. The 
WODC (SiBa) once again provided the analysis of the public prosecution service’s database 
and our thanks go to them.

Thanks also to Anje van Delden, the interns and thesis writers who explored some of the 
subjects	covered	in	this	report	in	consultation	with	BNRM	and	whose	findings	are	referred	
to where appropriate in the report.

Special	thanks	go	to	all	employees	and	former	employees	of	my	office,	who	all	made	valuable	
contributions to this report.

Introduction

1.1 General overview

Efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking	have	continued	to	receive	a	lot	of	both	media	and	politi-
cal	attention	in	the	last	two	years.	Unfortunately,	however,	human	trafficking	still	remains	
a	very	serious	problem.	The	professionalism	of	those	engaged	in	fighting	human	trafficking	
and caring for victims has increased in recent years. A task force has been set up, the police 
and the public prosecution service have given the matter priority and there is more specialist 
help	available.	With	a	Reference	Framework	for	Human	Trafficking	(2008),	the	police	have	
formulated a uniform method for dealing with the offence. Steps are being taken to develop 
a	programmatic	approach	to	human	trafficking,	in	which	all	of	the	agencies	in	any	way	con-
cerned with the problem address it systematically. A survey has been conducted to identify 
areas	in	which	obstacles	can	be	placed	in	the	way	of	human	traffickers.	The	organisations	
that provide help for victims are also cooperating more closely with partners in the chain by 
sharing information and referring victims.
The	 perception	 of	 human	 trafficking	 as	 a	 serious	 problem	has,	 if	 possible,	 become	 even	
greater.	The	sentences	for	human	trafficking	have	been	increased	in	recognition	of	the	fact	
that it is a very serious offence that seriously impinges on human dignity and integrity, fre-
quently involves serious organised crime and engenders intense and growing public anger. 
The	tougher	sentences	more	clearly	reflect	the	seriousness	of	the	offence.
By extension, the government proposes expanding its extra-territorial jurisdiction in line 
with the possibilities provided by the Council of Europe’s Convention on Actions against 
Trafficking	 in	 Human	 Beings	 to	 encompass	 offences	 committed	 against	 Dutch	 people	
abroad	and	to	expand	the	possibilities	of	confiscating	illegally	earned	profits.
Attitudes towards the prostitution sector have also changed. Whereas several years ago the 
predominant view was that prostitution should be regarded as an ordinary profession and 
the ban on brothels was lifted, there is now a wider realisation that prostitutes are highly 
vulnerable	to	exploitation	and	that	human	trafficking	occurs	even	in	the	licensed	sector	of	
the prostitution industry. The Sneep	case	was	particularly	important	in	exposing	significant	
abuses. In that context, a new framework law to regulate the prostitution sector is being 
drafted, which is intended to provide more direction and uniformity for policy.
Article	273f	of	the	Dutch	Criminal	Code,	which	makes	human	trafficking	a	punishable	of-
fence,	is	generally	fairly	familiar	to	professionals	who	are	confronted	with	human	traffick-
ing in the sex industry. However, the scope of the article is not entirely clear with regard to 
exploitation in sectors outside the sex industry. When the application of the provision was 
expanded to these sectors, it was consciously decided to leave the detailed implementation

30

to the courts. The scope of the offence is relevant not only for the purposes of investigating 
and	prosecuting	human	traffickers,	but	also	for	the	victims.	Victims	of	human	trafficking	are	
entitled to care and assistance and have certain rights, particularly under immigration law. 
Victims	of	human	trafficking	in	sectors	outside	the	sex	industry	are	not	universally	recog-
nised and in practice they are far less likely to be automatically granted the associated rights 
than in the case of sexual exploitation. The legal position of the victims is the same, but in 
practice the perception of some actors is that exploitation in other sectors is less serious 
than in prostitution. However, the seriousness of the exploitation does not necessarily have 
anything to do with the sector in which it occurs. In mid 2009 a possible case of exploitation 
on an asparagus farm in Someren came to light. The reactions of the various agencies and 
authorities involved illustrated the fact that other forms of exploitation are not automatically 
‘seen’ as such. This case is discussed at length in Chapter 12 (Exploitation in sectors other 
than the sex industry).
Human	trafficking	takes	place	in	secrecy.	Many	victims	are	also	unwilling	to	report	their	ex-
ploitation.	This	is	why	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking	depend	so	greatly	on	recognising	
and responding to the signs. What is needed is a process to raise awareness. It is crucial that 
signs	of	potential	abuses	are	recognised.	Police	officers	and	employees	of	the	various	govern-
ment inspectorates receive training to help in this. But numerous other professionals can 
also	be	confronted	with	situations	involving	exploitation.	It	is	essential	to	find	ways	of	in-
forming these professional groups about the problem and how they can identify the signs.
The	general	public	is	no	longer	unaware	of	human	trafficking,	partly	thanks	to	the	aforemen-
tioned media coverage of the subject. The Sneep and Koolvis cases have attracted a lot of public-
ity. However, this does not mean that members of the public are also on the lookout for situ-
ations that may involve exploitation. The same applies for some local authorities. The larger 
municipalities	have	a	human	trafficking	policy,	but	many	small	municipalities	still	believe	they	
are	immune	to	the	problem,	a	belief	that	is	in	practice	a	misconception.	Human	trafficking	oc-
curs everywhere, despite the widely held view that as a form of modern slavery it is a thing of 
the past. There is therefore a lot to be gained with an awareness-raising campaign.
The police and public prosecution services have given priority to investigating and prosecut-
ing	human	trafficking	in	recent	years.	The	policy	has	been	adopted	that	in	principle	every	
serious	indication	of	human	trafficking	will	be	followed	up.	Expertise	is	being	accumulated	
in various ways. But how the courts deal with the offence is another element in successfully 
addressing	human	trafficking.	The	legal	aspects	and	the	context	make	human	trafficking	a	
complex offence. At the same time, there are not so many cases that judges hear them every 
day. The judiciary will also have to gain expertise in the coming years. This is equally impor-
tant for cases involving other forms of exploitation, since this is a relatively new area of law 
in	which	the	case-law	has	still	not	had	time	to	evolve,	although	the	professionals	in	the	field	
rely heavily on the direction provided by the case-law. Chapters 11 and 12 contain informa-
tion about the body of case-law in recent years.
Although the need to set priorities is recognised at national level, a practical problem facing 
the	police	and	public	prosecution	service	and	the	large	cities	is	that	they	lack	sufficient	ca-

pacity. This is a problem that has been referred to in all of the previous reports. Even in this 
period when public expenditure is under pressure at every level, it is important to continue 
reviewing whether the policy objectives in this important area can be achieved with the avail-
able resources. Naturally, capacity is not the only determining factor. Awareness, attitude 
and training are also very important.

1.2 Human Trafficking Task Force

The	Dutch	government’s	policy	on	human	trafficking	is	laid	down	in	the	National	Human	
Trafficking	Action	Plan	(NAM)	of	December	2004,	which	was	supplemented	by	an	adden-
dum	in	February	2006	specifically	addressing	the	protection	of	underage	victims.	The	prac-
tical	significance	of	the	NAM,	as	a	coherent	programme	to	combat	human	trafficking,	seems	
to have faded somewhat into the background however.
This	is	connected	with	the	activities	of	the	aforementioned	Human	Trafficking	Task	Force,	
the	aim	of	which	is	to	identify	and	remedy	shortcomings	in	efforts	to	tackle	human	traffick-
ing by removing practical obstacles. To this end, in July 2009 the task force presented an 
Action	Plan	to	carry	out	its	mandate	in	which	it	formulated	ten	specific	measures	to	address	
problems	 it	had	 identified.	Practical	 targets	will	be	 formulated	 for	 these	measures,	which	
will be implemented by the representatives of the organisations participating in the task 
force. For example, pilot projects will be organised to explore possibilities of developing a 
programmatic approach. In this way, the task force is making an essential contribution to 
tackling	human	trafficking.
Regardless of the practical effects of the action plan, the policy principles laid down in the 
NAM still apply. The action plan does not encompass all of the elements of the NAM. Par-
ticularly striking is that although special attention is required for the plight of underage vic-
tims, the action plan fails to provide it.
Given the task force’s role in ensuring that policy is implemented as effectively as possible 
through	interventions	by	the	relevant	key	figures,	the	NGOs	that	help	to	implement	the	pol-
icy	should	obviously	be	members	of	it,	as	the	National	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	
Beings (NRM) has repeatedly stated. It is a sign of progress in this regard that CoMensha 
has been invited to attend the meetings of the task force.
The task force updated the action plan in its progress report in September 2009. In that 
report the task force presented a list of ‘quick wins’, an overview of what had already been ac-
complished in relation to the ten measures it had formulated up to the middle of 2009. These 
quick wins are reviewed in the discussions of the various topics in the following sections.

1.3 Reports of offences

The report of an offence made by the victim often plays an important role as the starting 
point	for	a	possible	prosecution	for	human	trafficking	and	as	the	factual	basis	for	the	inves-
tigation. However, for various reasons victims often have to surmount a substantial barrier 

NMR Ch01-03.indd   31 09-06-10   00:03



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

32

before they actually report an offence. This is generally connected with fear of the perpetra-
tor, or even a sense of solidarity with the perpetrator, or an apparent sense of hopelessness 
at	finding	alternatives	to	the	situation	of	exploitation.	It	is	very	important	to	conduct	further	
research into the willingness of victims to report offences and to identify the factors that 
could	make	it	easier	to	report	them.	Human	trafficking	was	one	of	the	offences	included	in	
a study by the public prosecution service into the possibilities of allowing offences to be re-
ported anonymously. On the basis of their investigation, ROOD, the youth section of the SP 
party in Utrecht, Pretty Woman and a former victim of exploitation by a ‘loverboy’ (see the 
section ‘The loverboy method’ below) provide a vivid description of the problems confront-
ing victims of loverboys if they report an offence.1

Reports and incriminating statements are regularly withdrawn. However, this does not nec-
essarily have any consequences for the defendant’s liability for punishment. Human traf-
ficking	is	not	an	offence	that	depends	on	a	complaint:	a	defendant	can	be	convicted	without	
a	complaint	or	a	notification	by	the	victim.	Another	factor	that	always	has	to	be	considered	
is that the victim may have withdrawn the complaint or the statement because of a threat. 
Since	human	trafficking	cases	can	be	investigated	without	a	complaint,	telephone	taps	and	
surveillance can also be used to gather evidence and victims could be interviewed after the 
suspects have been arrested. The Sneep case is a good example of this.
The	National	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	regularly	receives	comments	and	
complaints from aid agencies and representative organisations about cases where victims 
of	human	trafficking	that	were	not	dealt	with	properly	by	the	police	and	public	prosecution	
service. Among others, these cases involved foreign victims who were, for example, being 
held in aliens detention, who were not given an opportunity to report an offence, were not 
offered	a	period	for	reflection	or	an	opportunity	to	apply	for	the	B9	regulation	or	who	felt	
that in their cases the charges were wrongly dropped or not properly investigated.
At the same time, the police and public prosecution service say they waste a lot of time deal-
ing with ‘hopeless B9 applications’. This a reference to foreigners who are required to leave 
the Netherlands or have no prospect of being granted residence status and who then , some-
times	at	the	very	last	moment,	claim	that	they	were	victims	of	human	trafficking	or	are	rec-
ognised	as	such,	for	example	by	lawyers	or	aid	workers.	A	complaint	of	human	trafficking	
is then made and the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) grants the applicant a 
B9 residence permit, but the complaint provides few if any leads for an investigation and/
or	contain	old	facts	that	are	difficult	to	investigate	or	verify.	Consequently,	these	cases	can	
seldom be prosecuted successfully but they do take up resources, sometimes considerable 
resources,	because,	according	to	the	Instructions	on	Human	Trafficking,	they	must	be	inves-
tigated.	The	Office	of	the	National	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(BNRM)	
acknowledges this problem. However, there is no immediate solution for it.

Introduction

33

Even	cases	where	the	complaints	do	provide	sufficient	leads	for	an	investigation	are	not	al-
ways dealt with.BNRM has conducted research into these ‘shelved cases’. The reason they 
are	shelved	is	a	discrepancy	between	the	priority	given	to	the	investigation	of	human	traffick-
ing cases on the one hand and the capacity actually available to investigate on the other, and 
the dispersal of some of the available capacity to cases in which there are not many leads, as 
in some of the B9 cases. The results of the BNRM’s study are presented in Chapter 8 (Inves-
tigation).
BNRM	has	also	conducted	research	into	the	procedure	for	filing	objections	with	the	appeals	
court	against	decisions	not	to	prosecute	human	trafficking	cases	on	the	grounds	of	article	12	
of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure. In 43 of the 44 cases that were examined, the ap-
peals court declared the objection unfounded, usually because no leads were found despite 
a lengthy investigation by the police. The results of this study are presented in Chapter 5 on 
the B9 regulation and continued residence (B16/7).

1.4 Compensation

The possibilities that are in principle open to victims to recover damages they have sustained 
were described in the Fifth Report of the Dutch National Rapporteur. This report addresses 
the issue of whether the instrument of an order to pay compensation that the judge can award 
with the sentence, either on request or ex officio, is effective in practice. It also reviews the 
practical	significance	of	making	a	claim	to	the	Violent	Offences	Compensation	Fund.	The	
BNRM’s review of the case-law shows that judges often declare claims for compensation by 
victims inadmissible, especially claims for material damage, because they are – as being too 
complex – not submitted. Where all or part of the claim is awarded and an order to pay com-
pensation is made, the amount awarded to the victim is collected by the Central Fine Collec-
tion Agency (CJIB). Section 4.3 of Chapter 4 (Victims and help for victims) shows that this 
procedure provides no guarantee that the matter will be dealt with quickly or even that the 
compensation will ultimately be paid. A claim to the compensation fund still offers the best 
chance of success. However, this fund does not make any payments for loss of earnings.

The situation could be otherwise, as is apparent from Van Delden’s description of the situa-
tion in the United States:

Restitution in the United States2

In the US there are various ways in which restitution, or the instrument of compensation, 
should be adopted in sentencing in federal cases. For some offences, restitution is discretion-
ary.	In	most	others	–	the	so-called	Title	18	offences,	including	various	human	trafficking	pro-
visions3 – restitution is in fact mandatory. With this latter type of restitution, the legislature 
was	thinking	of	complete	indemnification	of	the	victim	to	be	imposed	ex officio by the court. 
All medical expenses – including psychological and psychiatric damage and physiotherapy –,

loss of income, legal costs, temporary accommodation costs, child care and any other costs 
that can be regarded as a direct (proximate) consequence of a criminal offence must be paid 
by the perpetrator(s).4 All damage that can be regarded as a direct consequence of the offence 
is therefore eligible for compensation in full. An additional advantage of mandatory restitu-
tion is that it is automatically included as an independent sanction with the special conditions 
attached to provisional release, so that it can be used to apply pressure in the supervision of a 
perpetrator.5

The American approach differs remarkably from the Dutch situation with respect to the dis-
cretion concerning the awarding of damages to the victim. Whereas the Instructions on Hu-
man	Trafficking6 for the public prosecution service in the Netherlands contain no obligations 
or	sequences	for	ways	of	providing	financial	redress,	the	reparation	of	damage	sustained	by	the	
victim is legally mandatory in the US. The prosecutor in America is also remarkably proactive 
in enforcing the reparation of the damage caused to the victim. Although this study of restitu-
tion in America focussed on cases in involving other forms of exploitation, in various cases 
houses	and	offices	were	seized	with	a	view	to	their	forfeiture.7 The legislature in the Nether-
lands has also made this possible on the grounds of an order of garnishment (article 94a of 
the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure), but in practice this provision is rarely used in human 
trafficking	cases.NRM5

The position of the victim is receiving attention in the Netherlands and in other countries. 
For example, the Netherlands has transposed some of the obligations in the EU’s Framework 
Decision on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings (2001)8 in the bill entitled ‘Act 
to strengthen the position of victims in criminal proceeedings’.NRM5 It covers, among other 
things, the rights of victims to compensation and includes a scheme for providing an ad-
vance on compensation.9 The scheme will obviously also apply to human	trafficking,	which	
after all usually involves a (serious) violation of a person’s physical integrity.10

Compensation for Trafficked and Exploited Persons in the OSCE Region (2008) shows that vic-

tims also face problems in securing compensation in other countries.11 There are criminal 
law, civil law and labour law procedures and, in some countries, also compensation funds (as 
in	the	Netherlands)	but	nevertheless	it	is	difficult	for	victims	to	recover	damages,	either	from	
the offender or from the State.
In this context the OSCE, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNH-
CHR) and the Council of Europe recommend using ‘criminal assets’ to compensate victims 
or establishing funds to help and rehabilitate victims.12

1.5 The lover-boy method

There	are	many	underage	victims	in	the	Netherlands	who	are	exploited	by	human	traffick-
ers known as ‘loverboys’. This term is usually used to refer to the methods employed by a 
generally	young	human	trafficker	who	seduces	vulnerable	young	girls	and	persuades	them	
to work as prostitutes for him. The Minister of Justice has introduced the term ‘pimp boy’ in 
this context to eliminate any misunderstanding about the nature of this form of human traf-
ficking.	However,	simply	replacing	the	term	does	not	resolve	the	problem	that	the	absence	
of	a	clear	definition	of	what	the	offence	involves	can	still	easily	lead	to	misunderstandings.	
This	is	connected	with	the	fact	the	methods	employed	by	human	traffickers	are	constantly	
changing. The loverboy method is one example of this. For example, it no longer involves 
just young men, or exclusively vulnerable young Dutch girls, or only seduction techniques, 
or not just exploitation in the sex industry. Consequently, the term loverboy (or pimp boy) 
is no longer distinctive in every case. In practice, however, the term is commonly used and is 
not misunderstood. In that respect, the term ‘pimp boy’ is actually less clear.

1.6 Data collection

The accurate registration of data is essential for the implementation of the policy to combat 
human	trafficking.	The	national	registration	of	(suspected)	victims	of	human	trafficking	is	
delegated to CoMensha. The public prosecution service also records data about criminal 
cases and the IND keeps records relating to immigration law. All of the registers kept by 
these different organisations suffer from constraints that are further discussed in Chap-
ters 4, 5 and 10.
The development of an effective Dutch standard for the registration of data about human 
trafficking,	including	a	uniform	definition	of	who	is	a	victim,	is	also	important	in	an	inter-
national perspective. Considerable efforts are being made at international level to generate

proceeds of crime or property to the requesting State Party so that it can give compensation to the victims of 
crimes, see art. 14, paragraph 2 of the Convention.

statistics	about	human	trafficking.	There	have	been	several	recent	initiatives	to	improve	the	
collection	of	data	about	human	trafficking,	including	a	joint	project	by	the	Austrian	govern-
ment,	the	International	Organisation	for	Migration	(IOM)	and	various	partners	and	financed	
by the European Commission, which produced guidelines on the collection of data about hu-
man	trafficking.	The	International	Centre	for	Migration	Policy	Development	(ICMPD),	one	
of	the	partners	in	that	project,	has	also	been	engaged	for	years	in	building	human	trafficking	
databases in various European countries. The utility and usefulness of the database for the 
countries in question is an important guiding principle of the ICMPD’s work. These initia-
tives are described in more detail in Chapter 3 (International developments). The question 
that arises here is how important a role statistics can play. Statistical overviews may indicate 
where efforts need to be concentrated and give an indication of the capacity that is needed, 
but qualitative information is also required to formulate solutions in terms of prevention and 
repression. Nor can the aim of harmonising international data collection be expected to pro-
vide	a	complete	solution,	because	although	human	trafficking	is	often	organised	on	an	inter-
national	scale,	it	occurs	in	a	specific	local	context,	so	information	about	the	specific	situation	
in different countries is equally important. The efforts to establish a comprehensive system 
of data collection should therefore be in proportion to the anticipated results. One way or 
another,	it	is	important	to	closely	monitor	international	developments	in	the	field	of	registra-
tion	of	human	trafficking	and	its	victims.

1.7 Systematic review

Methodological restrictions, missing data,13	differences	of	opinion	about	definitions,	a	lack	
of agreement on whether there is a difference between forced and voluntary prostitution14 
and	conflicting	results	of	research	are	characteristic	of	and	complicate	research	into	human	
trafficking.15

Although	 there	have	been	various	 initiatives	 to	prevent	human	 trafficking	and	 to	help	 its	
victims it and although a lot has been written about these initiatives, there is still very lit-
tle known about the implications of those initiatives. We don’t actually know ‘what works’. 
The reason for this is that most publications are primarily descriptive, based on qualitative 
research.	Key	figures	are	the	source	of	information	in	most	research	16 and very rarely is re-
search conducted to evaluate interventions. Certainly independent research, in other words 
research not conducted by those who designed or executed the intervention, is scarce17 and 
random sampling seldom occurs.18 The research that is done often involves very small re-
search groups and there is no question of so-called triangulation.

Introduction

37

However,	good	evaluations	of	anti-human	trafficking	interventions	are	scarce19 even though 
the seriousness of the offence and its impact on the victims make it very important to learn 
more	about	the	mechanics	and	effects	of	anti-human	trafficking	strategies	and	interventions,	
if only because we know that they can cause ‘collateral damage’,20 for example by restricting 
the possibilities for young women to migrate or even to travel.
To make some progress in this regard, the BNRM, in association with the University of 
Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement 
(NSCR) carried out a systematic review of the literature concerned with research into strate-
gies	and	interventions	in	the	field	of	human	trafficking.21 For various reasons, the review, for 
which a detailed research plan (protocol) was being evaluated by the Campbell Collabora-
tion22	at	the	time	this	report	was	written,	is	limited	to	transnational	human	trafficking	with	
a view to exploitation in the sex industry.23 The aim of the review is to generate information 
on two fronts:

 – the	effects	of	anti-human	trafficking	interventions,	and
 – the strengths and weaknesses of research in this area.

1.8 The Netherlands Antilles and Aruba

The tasks and powers of the NRM are limited to the Netherlands. The Netherlands Anti-
lles and Aruba, which are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, fall outside the scope of 
the NRM’s research. Consequently, previous reports of the NRM did not cover the situa-
tion	with	regard	to	human	trafficking	in	the	Kingdom’s	island	states.	In	light	of	the	pending	
constitutional	reforms,	the	human	trafficking	situation	in	these	island	states	is	also	briefly	
reviewed here.

Steps	are	already	being	taken	to	tackle	human	trafficking	 in	the	Netherlands	Antilles	and	
Aruba.	For	example,	in	June	2008	a	mini-conference	was	held	in	Aruba	on	human	traffick-
ing, human smuggling and illegal immigration in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles and the 
Netherlands. During this conference the ministers of justice of the three countries described 
the	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking,	human	smuggling	and	illegal	immigration	as	a	pri-
ority	for	all	of	 the	countries	 in	the	kingdom.	The	final	conclusions	of	the	conference	also	
stressed the importance of cooperation, of building expertise, of training people who deal 
with victims and of information throughout the chain of legal enforcement. On 28 January 
2009, the ministers of justice of the three countries signed a Memorandum of Understand-

19 (GAO, 2007) 
20 Boermans, 2009; Dottridge, 2007b; Limanowska, 2003.
21 The Dutch Ministry of Justice’s Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) is now also involved in the 

review.

tions and helps ensure that decisions are made on a well-informed basis (see www.campbellcollaboration.

ing	on	human	trafficking,	human	smuggling	and	illegal	immigration	in	the	Netherlands,	the	
Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. The Memorandum of Understanding states, among other 
things,	that	cooperation	between	the	three	countries	will	be	intensified24 and that priority 
will	be	given	to	tackling	human	trafficking.	It	was	also	agreed	that	the	provisions	of	the	UN’s	
Palermo	Protocol	and	 the	Council	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	
in Human Beings will be implemented in the countries’ legislation as soon as possible. The 
Memorandum of Understanding also contained agreements on control, investigation and 
prosecution and measures to prevent and protect victims.
Criminal	law	relating	to	human	trafficking	has	already	been	prepared	in	Aruba;	the	legisla-
tion largely corresponds with the Dutch legislation. As far as BNRM is aware, no defendants 
have	yet	been	prosecuted	for	human	trafficking	in	Aruba.	Four	preliminary	investigations	
have	been	carried	out	into	human	trafficking25 but they did not lead to prosecutions.26 There 
is	still	no	criminal	law	on	human	trafficking	in	the	Netherlands	Antilles,	although	there	is	
a	bill	before	the	Advisory	Council.	 In	practice,	cases	of	human	trafficking	are	prosecuted	
under other provisions of criminal law, such as the use of false documents and human smug-
gling.
The	American	Trafficking	in	Persons	(TIP)	Report	2009	assigns	a	Tier	2	(Watch	List)	rating	
to the Netherlands Antilles. The main criticism in the TIP report relates to the absence of 
legislation	on	human	trafficking	 in	the	Netherlands	Antilles.	According	to	the	report,	 the	
absence	of	 legislation	on	 this	point	prevents	 successful	prosecution	of	human	 traffickers.	
Another criticism in the report concerns what the report describes as the mainly ad hoc 
nature of the protection of victims. Although several measures have been taken in the area 
of prevention, no action has been taken to reduce demand for prostitution, according to the 
TIP report. Among other things, the TIP report recommends the implementation of human 
trafficking	 legislation,	 the	formalisation	of	procedures	relating	to	the	proactive	 identifica-
tion	of	victims	and	the	provision	of	information	to	prostitutes	and	beneficiaries	of	economic	
exploitation. Although the TIP report is critical of the Netherlands Antilles, it also states that 
the	country	is	striving	to	comply	fully	with	minimum	standards	for	tackling	human	traffick-
ing.

As the above survey shows, various steps have been taken to prevent and combat human 
trafficking	in	Aruba	and	the	Netherlands	Antilles.	It	is	also	clear	that	legislation	and	policy	
are	still	evolving	and	that	efforts	to	counter	human	trafficking	are	still	not	optimal.	This	is	
partly	due	to	insufficient	capacity	and	resources.	Although,	as	already	mentioned,	the	Na-
tional	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	has	had	no	involvement	with	Aruba	and	
the Netherlands Antilles up to now, that will change when Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, 

24 One of the provisions states that the Netherlands will provide assistance in the form of expertise.
25 Three studies related to exploitation in the area of work, one study concerned sexual exploitation. Source:

Introduction

39

three of the islands making up the Netherlands Antilles, become special municipalities of 
the Netherlands and will therefore fall within the remit of the National Rapporteur on Traf-
ficking	in	Human	Beings.	Although	Curacao	and	Sint	Maarten	will	be	countries	within	the	
Kingdom and Aruba will retain its separate status, there is cooperation between those coun-
tries	and	the	Netherlands,	as	is	reflected	in	the	Memorandum	of	Understanding.

1.9 Rapporteurs in the EU member states

The Hague Declaration in 1997 called on all countries in the EU to appoint a national rap-
porteur	on	trafficking	in	human	beings.	Up	to	now,	several	other	countries,	in	addition	to	the	
Netherlands, have established an institution that is somewhat similar to that of the national 
rapporteur	on	trafficking	in	human	beings	as	recommended	in	The	Hague	Declaration.	The	
NRM’s independent position is almost unique in international terms. In other countries the 
national rapporteur, or a similar mechanism, is usually incorporated in a government or-
ganisation, such as a ministry or the police. Various other countries, even outside the EU,27 
have	said	that	they	are	interested	in	appointing	such	an	official	or	are	considering	appointing	
a national rapporteur.
The	Council	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005)	
also calls on states to consider appointing a national rapporteur – or another mechanism – to 
monitor	efforts	to	combat	human	trafficking	and	the	implementation	of	national	statutory	
requirements.28 The independent NRM in the Netherlands is mentioned as an example in the 
explanatory memorandum to the convention.
Since it was founded in April 2000 the NRM has encouraged the appointment of rappor-
teurs	on	human	trafficking	in	other	EU	member	states	and	elsewhere.NRM1 One of the rea-
sons it did so was to make it easier to place the information collected in the Netherlands in 
a wider context and analyse it, to make comparisons and to identify more easily any move-
ments across borders as a result of the policy. It is therefore nice to report that in June 2009 
the Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on the establishment of an infor-
mal	EU	network	of	national	rapporteurs	on	human	trafficking	or	similar	mechanisms.	 In	
this	document	all	the	member	states	are	invited	to	participate	in	an	informal	and	flexible	net-
work	designed	to	increase	understanding	of	the	phenomenon	of	human	trafficking	and	with	
the aim of providing the EU and the member states with objective, reliable and comparable

–	up-to-date	–	strategic	information	on	human	trafficking.29 An important aspect of these 
conclusions is that every member state is (again) invited to appoint a national rapporteur or 
establish a similar mechanism. The EU states that it would be useful for every state to have 
a	specific	coordination	and	reporting	mechanism	and	endorses	the	recommendations	of	the	
OSCE report that national rapporteurs or similar mechanisms should help states to collect, 
analyse and report on quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve measures against 
human	trafficking.30 A start was made in developing a network of national rapporteurs and 
similar mechanisms with meetings in Stockholm31 and Vienna.32  It is not yet clear how the 
network will evolve in future.

1.10 The content of this report

This report presents statistics for the period up to and including 2008. The emphasis is on 
the	statistics	for	2007	and	2008,	to	supplement	the	figures	up	to	and	including	2006	in	the	
sixth report. However, some data for 2008 are not available. For practical reasons, the data 
from the public prosecution service do not cover 2008, although from this year statistics can 
also be provided about compensation (from the CJIB) and appeals (from the Research and 
Policy Database for Judicial Documentation (OBJD)).
The report supplements the information provided in earlier reports. The topics covered are 
victims, help for victims, the administrative approach, investigation and prosecution of hu-
man	traffickers,	the	relevant	legislation	and	international	developments.	The	report	also	ad-
dresses	a	number	of	more	specific	subjects,	with	separate	chapters	devoted	to	‘other	forms	of	
exploitation’,	the	non-punishment	principle,	human	trafficking	with	a	view	to	organ	removal	
and the B9 regulation and continued residence on the grounds of B16/7 of the Aliens Act 
implementation Guidelines. The results of the BNRM’s study into the case-law on human 
trafficking	in	recent	years	are	also	presented.
Each chapter concludes with a section containing the main conclusions to be drawn from the 
information	in	that	chapter.	As	in	the	earlier	reports,	the	final	chapter	contains	a	number	of	
recommendations.

Chapter 2, Legislation discusses developments in legislation in the Netherlands that are rel-
evant	for	tackling	human	trafficking.	In	addition	to	article	273f	of	the	Dutch	Criminal	Code,

Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2008, are discussed. The chapter also explains 
changes	in	other	laws	that	are	relevant	for	dealing	with	human	trafficking,	such	as	the	Hous-
ing Act. There is also discussion of pending legislation, including the (draft) bill on the li-
ability of companies for temporary employees that they hire and the bill to expand the pos-
sibilities	for	confiscating	criminal	assets.

Chapter 3, International developments discusses relevant developments in the UN, the EU, 
the	Council	of	Europe	and	the	OSCE.	These	include	findings	of	international	(UN)	mecha-
nisms that monitor compliance with human rights, the implementation of the EU Action 
Plan	against	human	trafficking,	the	appeal	to	countries	to	appoint	a	national	rapporteur	or	a	
similar mechanism and the EU Directive providing for sanctions against employers of ille-
gally staying third-country nationals, which entered into force on 20 July 2009. The chapter 
also draws attention to the risk that provisions of the European Commission’s proposal for a 
new	framework	decision	on	human	trafficking	relating	to	help	for	and	protection	of	victims	
will curtail what has been achieved in that regard by the Council of Europe’s Convention 
(2005).

The	position	of	victims	of	human	trafficking	and	the	shelter	and	help	that	can	be	provided	
for them are discussed in Chapter 4, Victims and help for victims. The chapter presents Co-
Mensha’s	statistics	on	victims	and	describes	several	specific	groups	of	victims.	It	also	draws	
attention	to	the	urgent	need	to	provide	shelter	and	help	that	is	more	specifically	tailored	to	
the	needs	and	circumstances	of	victims	of	human	trafficking,	and	particularly	underage	vic-
tims. Finally, important new initiatives in the area of care and shelter are discussed.

Chapter 5, B9 and continued residence (B16/7) contains information about the changes to 
the rules in chapters B9 and B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines. The topics 
discussed include the problems experienced in practice in applying the B9 scheme. BNRM 
organised a meeting of experts to discuss the problem of complaints that provide too few 
leads for an investigation and which, in view of the policy that every complaint must be reg-
istered and reported, takes up a lot of the police and public prosecution services’ capacity. 
This issue is also known as ‘abuse of B9(?)’. The results of this meeting are presented in this 
chapter.	BNRM	also	conducted	a	study	into	the	use	by	victims	of	human	trafficking	of	the	
possibility of objecting to a decision not to prosecute under article 12 of the Dutch Code of 
Criminal Procedure. The study reviewed 44 objections that were considered by the appeals 
court. Research was also conducted into the problems surrounding continued residence 
(B16/7	of	 the	Aliens	Act	 Implementation	Guidelines).	The	findings	from	both	studies	are	
presented in Chapter 5.

The non-punishment principle is discussed in Chapter 6, Victims as offenders and the non-
punishment principle. The non-punishment principle can establish grounds for not prosecut-
ing.	In	this	chapter	the	NRM	draws	attention	to	the	fact	that	it	can	be	very	difficult	to	identify	
victims	of	human	trafficking	who	are	initially	suspected	of	committing	a	criminal	offence	
while	in	a	human	trafficking	situation.	Awareness	of	this	problem	is	crucial.	The	chapter	also

42

zooms in on the potential consequences under immigration law for foreign victims who are 
also offenders and reviews how these problems are dealt with in other countries.

Chapter	7,	Administrative	and	integrated	approach	to	human	trafficking starts by giving an 
impression of various new forms of prostitution and sex-related business activity that have 
emerged. It warns of the ‘waterbed effect’, the phenomenon that when measures are taken 
against exploitation in a certain sector or in a certain location the trade often quickly moves 
to another location. That effect is reinforced by the fact that municipalities can formulate 
their own policy, which leads to substantial local differences which the trade can take advan-
tage of. Furthermore, in many municipalities there is no clear allocation of tasks between the 
municipality and the police with regard to supervision and enforcement. The powers of su-
pervision can differ from one municipality to another, and sometimes no powers have been 
allocated	at	all.	This	also	encourages	a	calculating	approach	by	human	traffickers.

Chapter 8, Investigation	once	again	highlights	how	difficult	it	can	be	to	identify	victims	of	
human	trafficking	and	why	for	that	reason	alone	it	is	essential	to	be	able	to	spot	all	of	the	
signs.	This	chapter	also	discusses	the	Reference	Framework	on	Human	Trafficking	(2008)	
produced	by	the	police’s	National	Group	of	Experts	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(LEM).	
The framework contains useful practical guidelines on how the police should handle human 
trafficking	cases.	However,	there	is	a	need	to	ensure	that	police	forces	are	required	to	follow	
those guidelines. The chapter points out that in practice the police do not always choose to 
deploy	capacity	to	investigate	human	trafficking,	that	the	creation	of	specialist	teams	is	bear-
ing fruit and that it is worthwhile removing obstacles to the sharing of information. In this 
context, it is good to report that the task force is addressing the concerns about the function-
ing	of	the	Centre	of	Expertise	in	Trafficking	in	Humans	and	Human	Smuggling	(EMM).

Chapter 9, Suspects and offenders presents statistics about these groups. There is also a 
discussion	 of	 various	methods	 employed	 by	 human	 traffickers	 and	 international	 human-
trafficking	organisations.	One	of	these	is	the	loverboy	method,	which	was	mentioned	above.	
The chapter shows that various individuals and institutions, referred to as ‘facilitators’, con-
sciously	or	unconsciously	help	human	traffickers	in	their	activities,	either	directly	or	indi-
rectly. The chapter also describes the so-called barrier model, which represents an attempt 
to	make	human	trafficking	more	difficult	by	exploring	ways	of	removing	the	basic	conditions	
for it; the conscious and unconscious facilitators reappear in this context. The chapter also 
draws attention to the need to develop methods to combat enforced Internet prostitution. 
Finally, there is a description of the Koolvis case, in which the entire criminal organisation 
was	identified	through	cooperation	with	the	country	of	origin	of	the	perpetrators	and	the	
victims (Nigeria).

One of the points made in Chapter 10, OM and prosecution is that the public prosecution 
service	has	been	very	ambitious	in	its	use	of	criminal	law	to	tackle	human	trafficking	in	re-
cent	years	but	that,	like	the	police,	the	service	sometimes	has	difficulty	putting	that	priority	
into	practice.	In	that	context,	attention	is	drawn	to	the	need	to	make	sufficient	capacity	avail-

able. An important step in that regard is the appointment of regional public prosecutors, 
who will also have an important role in acquiring cases. The public prosecution service is 
also called on to handle cases involving exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry, 
partly with a view to establishing case-law that will help clarify what precisely is meant by 
human	trafficking	in	these	sectors.	The	Instructions	on	Human	Trafficking	were	amended	
and	clarified	on	certain	points	on	1	January	2009.

Chapter 11, Case-law concerning exploitation in the sex industry presents the results of a 
study by BNRM into this subject. The picture to emerge from the survey of judgments ren-
dered	since	2007	was	of	a	complex	legal	field.	The	chapter	includes	statistics	on	the	case-law	
studied as well as a discussion of the method of formulating indictments and the interpreta-
tion by the courts of the various elements of article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code.

Chapter 12, Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry zooms in on the implications 
of	the	fact	that	human	trafficking	outside	the	sex	industry	is	still	a	relative	new	concept.	The	
scope	of	the	offence	is	still	unclear,	as	emerges	from	the	findings	of	a	study	by	BNRM	into	
the	case-law	on	other	forms	of	exploitation.	It	is	in	practice	difficult	for	officers	of	investiga-
tive agencies and government inspectorates to identify and recognise victims. Other forms 
of exploitation are often regarded as less serious than sexual exploitation. However, the se-
riousness of the exploitation does not in principle depend on the sector in which it occurs. 
This chapter reviews the scarce case-law on this topic and examines a number of groups that 
are particularly at risk of exploitation.

Finally, Chapter	13,	Human	trafficking	with	a	view	to	organ	removal presents the results of 
a further exploration of the subject by BNRM. Although there is attention to the subject in 
the Netherlands (and in other countries), scarcely any information is available about actual 
measures to prevent it. At best, there are indications that certain activities are being under-
taken. One way or another, it is essential to remain alert to this phenomenon.

The recommendations are to be found in Chapter 14 of this report.
They are followed by a summary and a list of the literature consulted.
The annexes include the text of article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code (in the versions valid 
up to and after 1 July 2009), the explanation of the research methods used, additional tables 
and the explanatory notes to them and a list of the BNRM’s activities.

Legislation and regulation in the Netherlands

2.1 Introduction

This chapter describes a number of changes in legislation and regulation in the Netherlands 
that	are	relevant	to	trafficking	in	human	beings.
Article	273f	of	the	Dutch	Criminal	Code	is	briefly	discussed	in	§2.2.
In §2.3, there is a review of recent changes in the rules under immigration law pertaining to 
victims	of	human	trafficking	and	witnesses	in	human	trafficking	cases.	The	existing	B9	regu-
lation	and	the	rules	for	continued	residence	for	victims	and	witnesses	in	human	trafficking	
cases are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
The draft bill to regulate prostitution – one of the aims of which is to prevent abuses such as 
human	trafficking	–	is	discussed	in	§2.4.
This English edition of the report omits the coverage of some new Dutch regulations that are 
of	incidental	relevance	to	human	trafficking	(§2.5	and	§2.6	of	the	original	report).

2.2 Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code

Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code has been amended since the NRM’s last report. 
The	fines	under	that	provision	were	increased,	with	effect	from	1	January	2008.	The	maxi-
mum	fifth-category	fine,	the	maximum	that	can	be	imposed	for	human	trafficking,	is	now	€	
74,000	rather	than	€	67,000.
The maximum unsuspended prison sentences were also increased, effective as of 1 July 
2009.1

NRM5 contained a description of the background to the drafting of Article 273f of the Dutch 
Criminal Code and of its contents. Chapter 11 of this report presents quantitative and quali-
tative	information	about	relevant	criminal	case	law	on	human	trafficking	in	the	sex	industry	
in the Netherlands. In Chapter 12 there is an overview of the current jurisprudence in the 
Netherlands	on	human	trafficking	in	other	economic	sectors	(‘other	forms	of	exploitation’),	
as well as a comparative survey of the situation in other countries.

Increased sentences
During	the	plenary	debate	on	prostitution	policy	and	human	trafficking	in	the	Lower	House	
of Parliament on 19 June 2008, the Minister of Justice promised to consult the public pros-
ecution	service	on	the	desirability	of	raising	the	sentences	for	human	trafficking.	In	Novem-

1 The bill was passed by the Lower House of Parliament on 3 February 2009. The Upper House passed the bill 
without a vote on 9 June 2009, Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees 2009, 245.

ber	2008,	he	did	propose	increasing	the	sentences	for	human	trafficking,2 although only the 
maximum	unsuspended	prison	sentences	and	not	the	fines.3

In	the	explanatory	memorandum	to	the	bill,	the	Minister	argued	that	human	trafficking	is	a	
very serious offence and constitutes a very serious violation of a person’s dignity and integ-
rity.	It	is	not	uncommon	for	human	trafficking	to	involve	serious	organised	crime.	There	is	
great public indignation at this form of modern slavery, and it is growing. The punishment 
of	human	trafficking	must	therefore	be	effective	and	powerful	and	act	as	a	deterrent.	In	light	
of	the	public	re-evaluation	of	the	seriousness	of	human	trafficking,	the	Minister	also	felt	that	
the	sentences	should	be	increased	to	reflect	more	accurately	the	seriousness	of	the	offence.	
The	following	specific	amendments	were	made:

 – in	the	first	paragraph	(unqualified	forms	of	human	trafficking),	the	maximum	term	of	im-
prisonment was increased from six to eight years;

 – in	the	third	paragraph	(human	trafficking	committed	by	two	or	more	persons	acting	in	
concert	or	human	trafficking	committed	in	respect	of	a	person	under	the	age	of	16),	the	
maximum term of imprisonment was increased from eight to 12 years;

 – in	the	fifth	paragraph	(human	trafficking	with	the	aggravating	circumstance	that	it	results	
in serious physical injury or a threat to the life of a person), the maximum term of impris-
onment was increased from 12 to 15 years;

 – in	the	sixth	paragraph	(human	trafficking	resulting	in	the	death	of	a	person),	the	maxi-
mum term of imprisonment was increased from 15 to 18 years.

The fourth paragraph of the article lapsed, because the sentence was increased for offences 
involving both the aggravating circumstances in the third paragraph. Until 1 July 2009, that 
paragraph	provided	that	the	maximum	term	of	imprisonment	for	human	trafficking	com-
mitted by two or more persons acting in concert and against a victim under the age of 16 was 
10 years.
From 1 July 2009, the maximum term of imprisonment for all aggravated forms of human 
trafficking	is	therefore	at	least	12	years.	It	is	therefore	possible	to	hold	suspects	in	pre-trial	de-
tention	on	the	basis	of	the	so-called	12-year	ground,	which	represents	a	significant	expansion	
of the possibilities for pre-trial detentionNRM5.4 Since the maximum term of imprisonment 
for	unqualified	forms	of	human	trafficking	is	eight	years,	it	is	now	also	possible	to	prosecute	
for the preparation of a criminal offence in relation to it (Article 46, Dutch Criminal Code).

2 Amendment of the Criminal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and a number of related laws in connection 
with the criminalisation of participation and assistance in training for terrorism, expansion of the possibili-
ties for the expulsion from a profession as an additional sanction and other amendments; memorandum of 
amendment, 27 November 2008, Parliamentary Documents II 2008/09, 31386 no. 9, p. 2.

2.3 Changes in the B9 regulation

The B9 regulation (Chapter B9, Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000) allows aliens 
who	are	(possible)	victims	or	witnesses	of	human	trafficking	to	remain	legally	in	the	Nether-
lands during the investigation and prosecution of the offence so that they remain available to 
the police and public prosecution service. Chapter B16/7 of the Guidelines contains the rules 
for granting continued residence – possibly after B9 – on humanitarian grounds, for victims 
and	witnesses	who	report	human	trafficking.

The B9 scheme has been amended in several respects since the publication of the last re-
portNRM6. In principle, a residence permit granted on the grounds of the B9 scheme will be 
revoked when the prosecution ends. The affect of the amendment of May 2008 is that the 
individual concerned can stay until the appeal to the Supreme Court is heard, since the Su-
preme Court could refer the case back to the court of appeal.5

The	National	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	argued	that	the	categories	of	aliens	
that	could	rely	on	the	B9	regulation	needed	to	be	clarified.	In	April	2009,	a	new	formulation	
of	the	target	groups	was	published,	which	more	clearly	reflected	that	the	B9	regulation	ap-
plies	identically	to	(possible)	victims	of	human	trafficking	who	are	working	(or	have	worked)	
in	the	sex	industry	and	to	(possible)	victims	of	human	trafficking	as	a	result	of	other	forms	of	
exploitation (Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code).6	The	reflection	period	is	also	now	open	to	
(possible) victims who enter the country through Schiphol.7 These amendments of the B9 
regulation apply with retroactive force from 1 January 2009.

Chapter 5, B9 and continued residence (B16/7), contains a summary of the content of these 
regulations as well as the results of various studies carried out by the BNRM into their im-
plementation: ‘abuse’ of B9 scheme? (§5.3), an analysis of the decisions by appeals courts on 
objections	(§5.4)	and	an	analysis	of	the	IND’s	files	on	applications	for	continued	residence	
after the application of the B9 regulation (§5.5).

5 Government Gazette, 29 May 2008, 102 (30 May 2008): B9/8.1, which entered into force on 2 June 2008. 
The text that applied until 2 June 2008 said that the appeal to the Supreme Court could not be awaited in the 
Netherlands, since the Supreme Court does not rule on the facts but only on whether the law was correctly 
applied. In fact, an appeal in the interests of the law can not be awaited in the Netherlands, since the decision 
cannot affect the rights and positions of the parties and therefore has no legal consequences for the parties 
concerned.

6 The NRM made a similar suggestion to the public prosecution service in relation to the amendment of the 
Instruction	on	Human	Trafficking,	see	chapter	10,	Public	Prosecution	Service	and	prosecution.

7 This amendment also contained an additional change in the consequences of the different forms of cassation 
for	the	right	of	the	victim	of	human	trafficking	to	residence,	Government Gazette. 24 April 2009, 78.

2.4 Draft bill to regulate prostitution and tackle abuses in the sex 
industry

At the end of 2008, a draft bill containing rules to regulate prostitution and some other forms 
of sex-related business (Regulation of Prostitution Act) was circulated to various agencies for 
comment. The bill arises from – among other things – the current government’s coalition 
agreement,8 its policy programme and the letter to parliament on the subject of prostitution 
entitled Safety Begins with Prevention.9 The law is intended to regulate the prostitution in-
dustry and, according to the government, tackle abuses such as coercion, abuse and human 
trafficking.

The law will require all sex companies to be licensed. At the same time, it proposes a more 
comprehensive system of regulation for prostitution than for other forms of sex-related busi-
ness. The obligations imposed on the operator and/or manager of a prostitution company will 
go further than the obligations imposed on the operators and/or managers of other sex busi-
nesses.
Prostitutes who work independently will have to register and clients of prostitutes who are 
working illegally will be subject to punishment. The draft bill also creates the possibility for 
municipalities to ban all prostitution (the zero option), but they will have to present arguments 
for doing so relating to public order, safety or health. Prostitutes will be punishable if they work 
without being registered or work in a company that is not licensed. The licences for prostitu-
tion businesses will include conditions on health, safety and the right to self-determination of 
the	prostitutes.	Sex	businesses	will	be	required	to	have	a	permanent	address	and	a	fixed	tel-
ephone line in order to receive a licence. For escort companies, the licences will be entered in a 
national register.10	Comments	were	invited	on	two	specific	issues:	the	first	was	the	possibility	
of raising the age for working as a prostitute, and the second was the possibility of recording 
the	names	of	alleged	victims	of	human	trafficking	in	the	register	of	prostitutes.

At the time of writing, this proposal was before the Council of State for its advice. It was not 
yet known when the bill would be sent to the Lower House of Parliament.

The NRM also made a number of comments on the original draft bill, which was submitted 
for consultation at the end of 2008, from the perspective of effectively combating human

trafficking.11 The letter with the NRM’s comments on the draft bill is included in Appendix 
5.	The	main	points	made	in	that	letter	are	briefly	presented	below.
A positive aspect of the bill is that the proposal would create a national framework within 
which every municipality must adopt rules governing sex businesses and independent pros-
titutes. That will reduce the differences in municipal policy on prostitution – and hence the 
discrepancies in the possibilities for supervision and enforcement from which human traf-
fickers	can	profit.	However,	uniform	rules	and	consistent	policy	are	also	crucial	in	tackling	
human	trafficking	and	from	that	perspective	municipalities	are	still	given	too	many	options,	
with all the risks that entails. The proposal to link licences to the activities rather than to 
the	establishment	will	greatly	help	in	the	fight	against	human	trafficking.	The	proposal	cor-
responds,	to	a	large	extent,	with	the	recommendation	in	the	fifth	report	of	the	NRM	(2007)	
calling for the formulation of a national legislative framework for prostitution policy based 
on the principle that every municipality must set rules for all establishments where commer-
cial sexual transactions are undertaken or where commercial facilities are provided for such 
transactions to be undertaken with or for a third party.
The scope of application of the draft bill is not yet entirely clear. The import of the term 
‘sex businesses’ in Article 1 under c is, partly in light of the explanatory memorandum, very 
broad, while at the same time the title of the act seems to imply restrictions.
Among	other	things,	registration	creates	the	possibility	of	identifying	human	trafficking	and	
should therefore cover all sex workers, not just prostitutes working independently. Regis-
tration should be seen as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. It is therefore very 
important that those who are given responsibility for maintaining the register possess the 
necessary expertise. It is unlikely that this will be possible in every municipality, particularly 
in smaller ones. Clustering of registers therefore seems a logical course of action.
Even	with	a	framework	as	is	now	proposed,	in	order	to	tackle	human	trafficking	it	will	re-
main crucial for all parties involved in the supervision of and enforcement in the sex industry 
to accept their responsibility, especially in view of the risk that activities might shift from 
the legal to the illegal domain. The proposal says nothing about a duty to make best efforts 
nor about the division of tasks between municipalities and the police. The text of the draft 
bill and the explanatory memorandum provide few guidelines on these matters, other than 
a proposal for an evaluation. Controlling licences is a task of the municipality. It is the task 
of	the	police	to	investigate	suspicions	of	human	trafficking.	Even	if	a	municipality	delegates	
some or all of its administrative tasks relating to the supervision of the sector to the police, 
it must be made clear which tasks are being delegated and which are not and are therefore 
being retained by the municipality. It is likely that controlling licenses will also continue to 
be primarily a task for the police. There is no further elaboration of the division of tasks be-

11 The draft bill was also circulated for their advice to municipalities, the police and the public prosecution 
service, the tax authorities, lawyers and judges, lobbyists for prostitutes and sex businesses, the centre of 
expertise	SOA	Aids	Nederland,	 the	Data	Protection	Authority	and	the	Human	Trafficking	Coordination	
Centre (CoMensha).

tween the local authority and the police.12 Agreements made between the local authority and 
the police will also have to include arrangements for the sharing of information. The current 
text of the bill and the explanatory memorandum do not answer the question of how the lo-
cal authority and the police will divide their tasks. It is, in any in case, totally unclear who will 
be responsible for the administrative enforcement (the local authority or the police). This 
vacuum increases the risk that the (administrative) supervision and enforcement of the rules 
laid down in the act will be inadequate.
On a positive note, the explanatory memorandum to the draft bill addresses supervision of 
the internet. A national team of detectives specialising in cyber crime is needed to tackle the 
supply of illegal forms of sex-related business on internet in order to prevent human traf-
ficking.	According	to	the	explanatory	memorandum,	a	further	study	will	be	carried	out	to	
investigate whether the creation of a national team of detectives to investigate online crime 
can help to tackle the supply of unlicensed prostitution and other forms of sex-related busi-
ness via internet. However, in the NRM’s opinion no further research is needed to establish 
the need for such a team.
The NRM noted that the proposed criminalisation of prostitutes13 is in itself a logical cor-
nerstone of the legislation, but shares the opinion of the Council of Procurators General14 
that	 for	persons	working	 in	an	unlicensed	sex	business	an	administrative	fine	would	be	a	
more logical sanction.

The	letter	requesting	comment	raised	two	specific	questions.
The	first	concerned	the	possibility	of	raising	the	minimum	age	for	working	in	prostitution.	It	
is impossible to clearly foresee the effects of raising the age limit, partly because not enough 
is known about illegal prostitution. To prevent – as far as possible – the raising of the age lim-
it	from	leading	to	more	illegal	youth	prostitution,	it	is	first	necessary	to	learn	more	about	il-
legal prostitution and tackle it more effectively. The NRM therefore recommends that there 
should	first	be	an	investigation	of	what	improvements	the	changes	in	the	rules	for	sex-related	
business	yield	in	this	regard	before	possibly	raising	the	age	limit.	The	first	evaluation	of	the	
act should therefore include a survey of the ages of sex workers working illegally or under 
coercion.
The	purpose	of	registration	is	to	be	able	to	identify	human	trafficking	and	to	erect	barriers	
to it. It is therefore important to keep records of where sex workers are working after they 
are registered. Immediate action should be taken if there is a suspicion that they are victims 
at	the	time	of	registration.	Indications	of	human	trafficking	should,	for	example,	be	reported	
immediately to the police and the EMM, and victims should be offered help if necessary. In 
view of this aim, the NRM feels that the suspicion that a person is a victim should not be 
included as grounds for refusing to register them.

2.5 Conclusion

This section discusses the problems that still exist in relation to the subjects covered in this 
chapter and the issues that deserve special attention.

Sentencing
The	sentences	for	human	trafficking	were	increased	as	of	1	July	2009.	From	that	date,	the	
maximum	 term	 of	 imprisonment	 for	 all	 unqualified	 forms	 of	 human	 trafficking	 is	 eight	
years.	The	maximum	sentence	 for	all	aggravated	forms	of	human	trafficking	 is	at	 least	 12	
years inmprisonment.
The B9 regulation has also been amended in a number of respects. For example, in April 
2009	a	new	formulation	of	the	target	groups	of	the	regulation	was	published,	which	reflects	
more clearly that the B9 regulation applies identically to (possible) victims of human traf-
ficking	working	in	the	sex	industry	and	to	(possible)	victims	of	human	trafficking	as	a	result	
of	other	 forms	of	exploitation	 (Article	273f	Dutch	Criminal	Code).	The	reflection	period	
is now also available to (possible) victims who enter the country through Schiphol. These 
amendments to the B9 regulation apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2009. Chapter 
5 presents a summary of the current content of the B9 regulation and continued residence 
(Chapter B16/7, Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines).

Bill to regulate prostitution and tackle abuses in the sex industry
An	important	development	in	the	field	of	legislation	was	the	appearance	of	the	(draft)	bill	to	
regulate prostitution and tackle abuses in the sex industry. This bill provides that all sex busi-
nesses are required to be licensed. At the time of writing, it was not yet known when the bill 
would be sent to the Lower House of Parliament. Although the NRM’s recommendations on 
the bill are included in Appendix 5 and still apply in full, this section also presents some of 
the problems and issue demanding attention that were mentioned in its advice on the bill.
A positive aspect is the fact that the proposal provides a national framework within which 
every municipality must lay down rules governing sex businesses and independent prosti-
tutes. That will reduce the differences in municipal policy towards prostitution – and hence 
the discrepancies in the possibilities for supervision and enforcement from which human 
traffickers	can	profit.	Uniform	rules	and	consistent	policy	are	also	crucial	for	tackling	hu-
man	trafficking.	In	that	context,	there	are	still	too	many	options	for	municipalities,	with	all	
the ensuing risks. The proposal to link licences to activities rather than to an establishment 
increases	the	possibilities	for	combating	human	trafficking.	The	proposal	corresponds	to	a	
large extent with the recommendation made in the NRM’s Fifth Report for the establish-
ment of a national legal framework for prostitution policy, based on the principle that every 
municipality must draw up rules for all establishments where commercial sexual activities 
are performed for payment or commercial opportunities are provided to perform those ac-
tivities with or for a third party for payment.

52

The scope of application of the bill is still not entirely clear. The import of the term ‘sex 
businesses’ is, partly in view of the draft explanatory memorandum, very broad; at the same 
time, the current title of the draft bill implies restrictions (‘regulation of prostitution and 
some other	forms	of	sex-related	business’).	The	title	of	the	bill	should	also	reflect	the	fact	that	
the rules encompass new and future forms of sexual activity, in any case including webcam 
sex, where sexual activities are performed on the internet for a third party for payment.

Furthermore,	an	‘independent	prostitute’	is	defined	as	a	prostitute	who	does	not	work	ex-
clusively	for	a	prostitution	business.	This	definition,	and	the	explanatory	note	to	it,	raises	a	
number	of	questions	relating,	for	example,	to	the	definition	of	‘prostitution	business’.	For	
example, how can it be determined that individuals are working only for a prostitution busi-
ness and not at least partially for themselves. This distinction is particularly important in 
light	of	the	proposed	mandatory	registration,	which	is	currently	confined	to	prostitutes	who	
work independently. The distinction would be less relevant if all sex workers had to register.

According to the proposal, the register of sex workers will include their names and address-
es, a telephone number and a copy of their passport. The question is whether this is enough. 
A comprehensive system should also include a passport photograph, a record of the type of 
sex work performed (for example, at home or as an escort) and the workplace if the sex work 
is	performed	at	a	specific	location.	Given	the	sensitivity	of	these	details,	access	to	and	use	of	
this information must be accompanied by adequate guarantees to protect the privacy of the 
individuals concerned.

The bill does not provide for an intake interview during the registration process, even though 
besides generating information this would provide an opportunity to identify possible signs 
of	human	trafficking.	Holding	such	an	interview	would	meet	the	duty	of	government	bodies	
to investigate the relevant facts before taking action.

With the introduction of a national licensing register, supervision of the escort service indus-
try can be strengthened. It should also make it easier to regulate companies that advertise on 
the internet. The register should include a record if a licence, or an extension of a licence, is 
refused, together with an explanation of the reasons for the refusal. Other licensing authori-
ties and regulatory authorities (municipalities) should also have access to this information 
and supervisory authorities should have 24-hour access to the register.

According to the bill, a prostitute who works for a prostitution business that does not have 
a licence or who works independently as a prostitute without being registered or who ad-
vertises without a registration number is committing an offence. Making it a punishable of-
fence for sex workers to work without being registered or to advertise without a registration 
number is in itself correct as the logical cornerstone of the duty to register. However, it is not 
self-evident to make it a criminal offence for a prostitute to work in an establishment that has 
no licence. It seems more logical that the municipality should deal with this offence with an 
administrative	fine,	which	is	more	in	line	with	the	policy	principle	that	criminal	law	will	not	
be used unnecessarily against victims.

One problem that remains is that the bill says nothing about obligations to make best efforts 
or about the division of tasks between the administration and the police. This vacuum in-
creases the risk that the (administrative) supervision and enforcement of the rules laid down 
in	this	law	will	be	inadequate.	However,	it	should	be	noted	here	that	the	Human	Trafficking	
Task Force is preparing a vision document on this point.

Other legislation
This chapter also discusses the Police Data Act and Police Data Decree, the Aliens Employ-
ment Act, an amendment to the Housing Act, the Public Nuisance (Administrative Fine) Act 
and the Closed Youth Care Act.
Pending legislation includes bills to implement relevant international law, such as the Coun-
cil	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005)	and	the	
Council of Europe’s Convention on the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation 
and Sexual Abuse (the Lanzarote Convention, 2007). Other relevant pieces of legislation 
are bills to enhance the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, a draft bill to expand 
the	possibilities	for	confiscating	criminal	assets	and	a	bill	on	the	liability	of	companies	for	
temporary employees that they hire.

International Developments

3.1 Introduction

This	chapter	reviews	the	major	international	developments	in	efforts	to	combat	trafficking	
in human beings: developments in relation to legislation, but also in terms of policy measures 
to	address	human	trafficking	at	an	international	level.
The collection of reliable information is crucial to the development of effective legislation and 
policies. In § 3.2, initiatives to promote the collection of international data are discussed.
Action	against	human	trafficking	is	also	an	important	priority	for	international	governmental	
organisations. The most important developments in this regard are discussed in this chapter. 
§ 3.3 outlines several developments in the United Nations, including debates in the General 
Assembly	devoted	to	the	subject	of	human	trafficking.	Human	trafficking	is	also	an	issue	ad-
dressed by various bodies responsible for supervising the enforcement of human rights.
The	 implementation	of	 the	EU	Action	Plan	to	Combat	Trafficking	 in	Human	Beings,	 the	
creation	of	a	new	Group	of	Experts	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	and	moves	to	establish	
a network of national rapporteurs are discussed in § 3.4. This section also reviews the Eu-
ropean	Commission’s	proposal	for	a	new	framework	decision	on	combating	trafficking	in	
human beings and the new directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally 
staying third-country nationals.
Developments in the Council of Europe are covered in § 3.5. In addition to the Convention 
on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005),	in	2007	in	Lanzarote,	the	Council	of	
Europe also adopted the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploita-
tion and Sexual Abuse.
An evaluation of the progress countries are making with national action plans and report-
ing mechanisms, carried out by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE) , is discussed in § 3.6.
The chapter concludes with a few remarks about the Netherlands’ international human 
rights policy (§ 3.7).

3.2 Data collection

In the last ten years, there has been enormous growth in the attention devoted to the subject 
of	human	trafficking	at	international	level,	with	various	interventions	being	devised	to	pre-
vent and combat it. As a result, the number of studies and publications devoted to human

trafficking	practices	has	increased	greatly.1 Despite all the research, however, there is still no 
consensus on such aspects as the true scale of the problem.2 The number of registered cases 
varies, depending in part on the prevailing policy towards recognised victims, and there are 
no reliable estimates.NRM5 A complicating factor is that individuals involved in human traf-
ficking	–	both	perpetrators	and	victims	–	fall	into	the	category	of	hidden	populations.3

Because	human	trafficking	often	occurs	across	borders,	effort	to	combat	it	effectively	must	
also	be	transnational.	If	international	policies	against	human	trafficking	are	to	be	effective,	
national governments have to share information and that information must be compara-
ble. Several international documents therefore call for the development of coordinated and 
standardised national data-collection systems to produce internationally comparable data. 
Many initiatives have been taken in response to this need in recent years.
While acknowledging the importance of consistent, comparable statistics about human 
trafficking,	it	has	to	be	stressed	that	qualitative	research	often	produces	the	most	valuable	
information and that the main purpose of quantitative data is to supplement qualitative in-
formation. It also has to be stressed that in the interests of acquiring complete, comparable 
data,	the	data	collection	should	be	confined	to	a	minimum	number	of	 indicators	covering	
information that can be acquired relatively easily.

Recent initiatives
There have been a number of recent international initiatives designed to produce interna-
tionally	comparable	data	on	human	trafficking.	Three	of	them	are	discussed	here.
The	purpose	of	 the	first	 initiative,	Development of Guidelines for the Collection of Data on 
Trafficking in Human Beings, Including Comparable Indicators, is to generate international-
ly comparable data in the EU member states. Guidelines have been drawn up for creating 
national systems for data collection and monitoring, as well as a list of essential indicators 
about which data should be collected.
The second initiative, Programme for the Enhancement of Anti-Trafficking Responses in South 
Eastern Europe – Data Collection and Information Management,	is	similar	to	the	first	in	the	
sense	that	it	also	includes	a	list	of	indicators	of	human	trafficking	to	ensure	that	the	data	col-
lected is internationally comparable. However, this programme only covers ten countries in 
South-East Europe.
The purpose of the third initiative, European Delphi Survey – A Practical Exercise in Devel-
oping Indicators of Trafficking in Human Beings, is different; its aim is to harmonise the def-
inition	of	human	trafficking	employed	by	different	countries.	A	 list	of	 indicators	has	also	
been drawn up for that purpose. However, these are not indicators for the collection of data: 
instead,	they	are	indicators	designed	to	help	in	identifying	victims	of	human	trafficking	in

practice. In that respect they are similar to the indicators in one of the annexes to the Dutch 
public	prosecution	service’s	Instructions	on	Human	Trafficking.4

The three initiatives are described in more detail below.

1)  Development of Guidelines for the Collection of Data on Trafficking in Human Beings, Including 
Comparable Indicators15

This is a joint project of the Austrian Ministry of Home Affairs and the International Organi-
sation	for	Migration	(IOM)	and	is	financed	by	the	European	Commission.	The	project	is	being	
carried out by a multidisciplinary team of experts, with representatives from various EU mem-
ber	states	who	are	concerned	with	human	trafficking	in	different	capacities	(enforcement,	re-
search, etc.).
In February 2009, these joint efforts led to the publication of Guidelines for the Collection 
of	Data	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings,	Including	Comparable	Indicators,	consisting	of	17	
guidelines for establishing national systems for data collection and monitoring in EU member 
states. The document also discusses the minimum amount of data, comparable at EU and in-
ternational levels and compatible with national data systems, that should be collected. It is felt 
that this form of coordinated and harmonised data collection will improve the protection of 
victims and the effectiveness of the prosecution of perpetrators and ultimately have a preven-
tive	effect	on	human	trafficking	in	general	at	national	and	European	level.
The aim of the 17 guidelines is to establish effective national data-collection systems and a single 
EU data-collection and data-exchange system. The principal aspects covered by the guidelines 
are the recognition of victims; the protection of victims; the collection, analysis and reporting 
of data; and guarantees for the protection of personal and sensitive data.
For example, the document recommends the creation of an independent body (in the form of a 
national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism) in each member state to collect data on human 
trafficking	at	the	national	level.	The	data	to	be	collected,	analysed	and	reported	by	this	body	
would come from various parties, including government agencies, social services, NGOs, in-
ternational organisations, the police, the public prosecution service, customs, the labour in-
spectorate and trade unions, all of whom should cooperate and share data with each other on 
the basis of an established protocol.
The	guidelines	 also	 contain	 a	number	of	 specific	 indicators	 for	which,	 as	 a	minimum,	each	
member state should collect information relating to victims, perpetrators, the criminal process 
and prosecution. The document also contains questionnaires with open and closed questions.

2)  Programme for the Enhancement of Anti-Trafficking Responses in South-Eastern Europe – Data 
Collection and Information Management (DCIM)6

The International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) launched this project in 
2006	to	improve	and	standardise	data	on	human	trafficking	in	ten	south-east	European	countries	
(Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldavia, Montenegro, Romania, 
Serbia and Kosovo). The organisation has collaborated with the governments of the ten countries, 
international experts and representatives of international and non-governmental organisations, 
such as the Migration, Asylum Refugees Regional Initiative (MARRI Centre), the Anti-Corruption 
and Anti-Trafficking network of NGOs	(ACTA)	and	Europol.	The	project	is	financed	by	the	Swiss 
Agency for Development Cooperation and Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

58

In 2008, the project resulted in the publication of a Handbook on Anti-Trafficking Data Collec-
tion in South-Eastern Europe: Developing Regional Criteria, consisting of a list of indicators 
broken down between a victim-centred database and a perpetrator-centred database. Each in-
dicator is explained in detail and there are two questionnaires with open and closed questions 
that should be used to provide the information about victims and perpetrators. After all, it is 
not only the indicators but also the method used to collect the information that affects the con-
sistency and comparability of data. Having said that, there is scope for divergence in the actual 
data collection in the south-east European countries with a view to differences in usefulness 
and practicality.
The victim-centred database consists of 56 indicators broken down into six dimensions: per-
sonal details, how victims were recruited, how they were transported to the country of destina-
tion, the situation in which they were exploited, the recognition of victims, the protection of 
victims and other data. The perpetrator-centred database contains 46 indicators covering six 
dimensions:	personal	details,	the	police	investigation,	the	trial	in	first	instance,	the	appeal,	the	
sentencing and other data. These two database systems are currently operational in the ten 
south-east European countries.7

At the time of writing, this project is being followed up with another one entitled Trafficking in 
Human Beings: Data Collection and Harmonised Information Management System (DCIM-EU). 
The main purpose of this project is to establish a transnational information-management sys-
tem and to formulate generally accepted and comparable indicators. At the same time, innova-
tive software is being developed which the participating states can use to collect data about 
human	trafficking.	The	results	of	this	study	are	expected	in	October	2009.8

3)  European Delphi Survey – A Practical Exercise in Developing Indicators of Trafficking in Human 
Beings9

The UN’s Palermo Protocol employs various key terms (such as coercion, deception, etc.) that 
require further elaboration to prevent the risk of differences in interpretation between and 
within	countries.	There	is	also	a	risk	that	victims	of	human	trafficking	will	not	be	recognised	
as such by researchers and law enforcement agencies or that an incident will be incorrectly de-
fined	as	human	trafficking.	The	development	of	operational	indicators	that	can	be	used	to	iden-
tify	human	trafficking	situations	and	victims	of	human	trafficking	could	resolve	this	problem.
As part of the EU Action Plan 2006-2010, the European Commission (EC) established a group 
of	experts.	In	2007,	this	group	established	a	subgroup	to	formulate	uniform	definitions	of	the	
key	terms	in	the	UN	Palermo	Protocol	on	trafficking	in	human	beings	and	the	associated	in-
dicators. The subgroup recommended that the EC and the International Labour Organisation 
(ILO) should launch a joint project employing the Delphi method10. The steering group for this 
EC-ILO project was made up of experts from the EC, the ILO, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).
This	Delphi	study	produced	four	lists	of	operational	indicators	of	human	trafficking	designed	to	
identify the sexual exploitation of adults (66 indicators), the sexual exploitation of children (66 
indicators), other forms of exploitation of adults (67 indicators) and other forms of exploitation

10 The Delphi methodology was developed in the 1950s and has since been used in the social, medical and 

political sciences. The aim of this methodology is to produce results based on consensus among a large 
group of experts from various disciplines. In this case, the experts were selected from 27 EU member states 
and worked for the police, government, universities, research institutes, NGOs, international organisations, 
labour inspectorates, unions and the judiciary.

of children (65 indicators). Each list consists of six dimensions encompassing various indica-
tors: deceptive recruitment (10 indicators), coercive recruitment (10 indicators), recruitment by 
abuse of vulnerability (16 indicators), exploitative conditions at work (9 indicators), forms of 
coercion at destination (15 indicators) and abuse of vulnerability at destination (7 indicators).11 
Each	indicator	is	classified	as	‘weak’,	‘medium’	or	‘strong’.	By	analysing	a	situation	on	the	basis	
of the number of ‘weak’, ‘medium’ or ‘strong’ indicators in that situation, it is possible to assess 
whether the relevant dimension exists. Finally, the combination of the presence or absence of 
the	six	dimensions	leads	to	a	conclusion	on	whether	a	human-trafficking	situation	exists.12

The	results	of	the	first	two	initiatives	discussed	have	included	the	drafting	of	a	list	of	interna-
tionally comparable data indicators that should be collected. A comparison of the two lists of 
indicators shows that there is only a small degree of overlap. At the moment, the Netherlands 
can only provide data for a few of the indicators. Data for many of the indicators requested 
are currently not collected at the national level. With the increase in the number of indicators 
on which data has to be collected, there is a danger that the data supplied will be incomplete. 
Experience shows that in practice the quantity of data to be collected reduces the quality of 
the data acquired. The impression is that there are currently a number of international or-
ganisations developing international data-collection systems but that there is no cooperation 
and, consequently different standards are being developed. It is important – for example in 
the EU – to adopt and use a single standard.

3.3 United Nations

3.3.1 UN Palermo Protocol

The Palermo Protocol is part of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime 
(UNTOC).13 Every two years the states parties to the Convention hold a conference to dis-
cuss ways of increasing their capacity to combat transnational organised crime and to im-
prove and evaluate the implementation of the Convention. The states parties had met three 
times since these instruments entered into forceNRM5. The fourth conference was organised 
in October 2008.14 During this session, states were urged to accede to the UN Protocol since 
one-third	of	the	UN	member	states	(192	in	all)	have	not	yet	ratified	it.15 For example, China 
and India are not yet parties to the Protocol or to the underlying treaty, which could facilitate 
international cooperation with these countries in criminal investigations.
According	to	the	United	Nations	Office	on	Drugs	and	Crime	(UNODC),	in	half	of	the	UN	
member	states	no	one	has	in	fact	ever	been	convicted	of	human	trafficking.16

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

60

During the most recent session, the Conference of States Parties decided to establish a 
Working Group on Trafficking in Persons with the task of making recommendations on how 
the parties could improve implementation of the provisions in the Protocol.17 The working 
group was also asked to make recommendations on how the Conference could improve co-
ordination in this area with various international bodies.18

In	addition	to	discussing	the	root	causes	of	human	trafficking	and	the	demand	side	of	the	
problem, many speakers at the conference stressed the importance of access to facilities for 
victims. A victim-centred approach fosters rehabilitation and reintegration as well as the co-
operation of victims with the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators. Many speakers 
also	emphasised	the	importance	and	the	difficulty	of	effectively	identifying	victims.	They	ex-
pressed the need to formulate a list of indicators, while stating that more expertise is needed 
(to	be	able	to	distinguish	between	situations	of	illegal	work	and	human	trafficking,	for	exam-
ple). During a side event at the fourth session of the Conference of States Parties, a number 
of NGOs highlighted the need for an independent and objective evaluation mechanism. 
Such a mechanism could help states to monitor and analyse the effects of their legislation 
and	anti-human	trafficking	measures.	It	could	also	help	in	identifying	obstacles	to	effective	
implementation of the UN Protocol; states should at the same time monitor the impact of 
measures	against	human	trafficking	on	human	rights.19 A group of experts will meet in 2009 
to	flesh	out	the	various	possibilities	for	such	a	mechanism20 and recommendations will be 
presented to the next Conference of States Parties in 2012.

3.3.2 Resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations

The United Nations’ General Assembly has recently adopted a number of relevant resolu-
tions.	Besides	resolutions	on	human	trafficking	as	such,	they	include	resolutions	on	other	
subjects, such as the rights of children,21 girls22 and female migrants23 in which the subject 
was mentioned.
Resolution 63/156, entitled Trafficking in Women and Girls, appeared on 30 January 2009.24 This 
resolution	encompasses	a	great	many	subjects	relating	to	various	forms	of	human	trafficking,	
ranging from forced prostitution to child pornography, child abuse and child sex tourism. The

General Assembly’s resolution stresses the need for a gender- and age-sensitive approach in 
all	anti-human	trafficking	efforts.	The	resolution	also	refers	to	the	lack	of	reliable	data	and	the	
need to promote the use of new information technologies such as the internet and calls on 
states	to	discourage	the	demand	that	fosters	trafficking	of	women	and	girls.25

States are encouraged to improve the collection of data and sharing of information and to pre-
vent	corruption	and	the	laundering	of	the	proceeds	of	human	trafficking.	The	resolution	calls	
on states to take the necessary measures to ensure that victims are not penalised for being 
trafficked	and	do	not	suffer	re-victimisation	and	to	prevent	victims	of	human	trafficking	being	
prosecuted for illegal entry or illegal residence in a country. The resolution also suggests that 
states should consider setting up a national coordination mechanism – such as a national rap-
porteur – with the participation of civil-society organisations (including NGOs).
The business sector, including the tourism industry and telecommunications companies, 
is	directly	invited	to	cooperate	with	governments	in	eliminating	human	trafficking.	States	
are invited to encourage internet service providers and other media to adopt self-regulatory 
measures. Governments, as well as inter-governmental bodies and organisations, are encour-
aged to ensure that military and humanitarian personnel and participants in peacekeeping 
operations	that	are	stationed	in	regions	of	conflict	and	other	emergency	situations	are	given	
training	 and	 information	 about	human	 trafficking.26 The resolution also contains recom-
mendations	concerning	the	prevention	of	trafficking,	as	well	as	help	for	victims	and	training.	
Finally, the Secretary-General is asked to submit a report to the 65th session of the General 
Assembly with recommendations on ways of strengthening a gender- and age-sensitive ap-
proach	in	the	efforts	to	address	trafficking	in	persons.

During the same (63rd) session, in January 2009 the General Assembly passed Resolution 
63/194, Improving the Coordination of Efforts against Trafficking in Persons.27 This resolution 
followed a report by the UN Secretary- General on the need to improve the coordination of 
efforts	to	combat	human	trafficking.28

In the resolution, the General Assembly again called on states to ratify and fully implement 
the relevant treaties. The General Assembly also asserted that broad international coop-
eration between member states and relevant international governmental organisations and 
NGOs	is	essential	in	tackling	human	trafficking.
The Secretary-General was called on to prepare a background document, which was then 
discussed	during	the	second	debate	devoted	to	human	trafficking	in	May	2009	(see	§	3.3.3	
below). The contents of the report from the Secretary-General are connected with the invi-

tation	made	to	states	in	Resolution	63/194	to	reflect	on	the	desirability	of	a	global	action	plan	
against	human	trafficking.

Reports of the Secretary-General
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has submitted several reports on human traf-
ficking	to	the	General	Assembly	and	the	Economic and Social Council in the last two years. 
One of those reports stressed the importance of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and 
gender-sensitive approach.29 Another report, on the elimination of all forms of discrimina-
tion and violence against girls, referred to the discrimination and violence, including human 
trafficking,	experienced	by	girls	during	armed	conflicts	and	in	post-conflict	situations.30 In a 
study into all forms of violence against women published by the Secretary-General, human 
trafficking	was	treated	as	one	of	the	forms	of	violence	against	women.31

A number of recommendations in the study on violence against children touch on human 
trafficking,	 and	suggestions	are	made	 for	measures	 to	 reduce	 risk	 factors	and	 to	 improve	
help for victims and support for high-risk individuals and families.32 In response to one of 
the recommendations in the report, the General Assembly asked the Secretary-General to 
appoint a Special Representative on violence against children.33

3.3.3 Debate on human trafficking in the General Assembly

In	June	2008,	the	UN	General	Assembly	devoted	a	debate	to	the	subject	of	human	trafficking	
for	 the	first	 time.	More	 than	40	delegations	 took	part,	 including	government	 representa-
tives, NGOs, experts, the private sector and civil-society organisations. Two panels were 
formed to discuss multilateral cooperation, help for victims and cooperation with prosecu-
tions. One of the conclusions to emerge during this debate was that there is still a wide gap 
between what is on paper and the reality in practice. Although there are instruments such 
as international legislation, they are not implemented at the national level. One suggestion 
that was made during the debate to accelerate implementation was the creation of a review 
mechanism.34 According to one of the participating states, a lack of political will was not the 
only reason for the lack of implementation. The fact is that many countries lack the neces-
sary resources. The US representative35 mentioned corruption, in addition to other subjects, 
as	one	of	the	major	challenges	in	combating	human	trafficking.	The	EU	called	on	member	
states to improve the implementation of the Palermo Protocol and the exchange of informa-

tion and best practices between countries. The IOM referred to the fact that the boundary 
between	human	smuggling	and	human	trafficking	is	not	always	clear,	although	this	distinc-
tion does have consequences in terms of the prosecution and protection of victims. Many 
speakers	also	argued	that	the	root	causes	of	human	trafficking	have	to	be	addressed,	as	do	the	
demand for cheap labour and commercial sex. During the debate there was a discussion of 
the	desirability	of	formulating	a	UN	strategy	or	action	plan	to	prevent	human	trafficking	and	
to protect and support victims. Among those that supported the drafting of an action plan 
were Belarus, the African Union, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and Russia.
Another	debate	devoted	to	human	trafficking,	entitled	Taking collective action to end human 
trafficking,	was	held	in	May	2009.	One	of	the	topics	specifically	discussed	in	various	panels	was	
the production of a Global Action Plan, partly in response to the Secretary-General’s report on 
the	need	to	improve	coordination	of	efforts	to	combat	human	trafficking.36 The EU said it is 
important	to	reinforce	existing	instruments	and	to	focus	on	the	ratification	and	implementa-
tion of existing treaties before establishing a new action plan, although it acknowledged that 
there was room for improvement in the synergy between existing instruments, organisations 
and agencies.37 Despite reservations expressed by some countries, the president of the General 
Assembly said he supported the development of a Global Action Plan.

3.3.4 UN.GIFT

The United National Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) was launched 
in March 2007 as a partnership between UNODC, ILO, IOM, UNICEF, OHCHR and the 
OSCE. The aim of the initiative is to mobilise state and non-state actors to eradicate human 
trafficking.38

The	first	global	forum	on	measures	to	combat	human	trafficking,	the	Vienna Forum to Fight 
Human Trafficking, was held in Vienna in February 2008 under the auspices of UN-GIFT. 
It was attended by representatives of states, NGOs, the business sector, scientists, interna-
tional	governmental	organisations	and	victims	of	human	trafficking.	The	objectives	of	the	
forum	were	to	increase	awareness	of	human	trafficking,	create	new	partnerships	and	facili-
tate cooperation. More than 1,600 participants from 416 countries discussed the various 
dimensions	of	human	trafficking	in	relation	to	security,	development	and	human	rights.	The	
Vienna Forum focused on three themes: vulnerability, impact and action.
One of the forum’s conclusions was that alliances can be expanded with various partners, 
including the private sector, the media and unions. An important recommendation made by 

36 See § 3.3.2.
37 Declarations by the Czech Republic’s EU presidency during the panel sessions, 13 May 2009. The EU stressed 

that	international	cooperation	is	very	important	in	combating	human	trafficking	and	that	the	UN	member	
states should focus primarily on operational cooperation and implementation of existing mechanisms and 
agreements, and not on drafting a new strategy. The Netherlands supported this position and has in fact de-
clared that it will press for closer cooperation between the relevant UN organisations, the OSCE and the IOM 
(Letter to parliament on the guidelines for the Kingdom’s delegation to the 63rd session of the UN General 
Assembly in New York, 4 September 2008, Parliamentary Documents II 2007/08, 26 150, no. 60)

one of the panels was to extend the three Ps (prevention, protection and prosecution) with the 
fourth ‘p’ of partnership.39 In her summary of the proceedings, the chairperson stressed the 
need to address all forms of exploitation, including those in sectors other than the sex indus-
try,	which	implies	that	national	legislation	should	embrace	every	aspect	of	human	trafficking	
and	the	ratification	and	implementation	of	the	UN	Protocol	and	other	relevant	international	
instruments. Another important conclusion was that parties in the labour market – employ-
ers’ organisations, trade unions, businesses and others – must become more active partners in 
guaranteeing labour rights and the protection of workers in order to prevent and tackle forced 
labour.	It	became	clear	that	more	research	is	needed	to	fill	in	the	crucial	information	gaps	and	
so	 enable	 adequate	measures	 to	 be	 formulated	 against	 human	 trafficking.	Research	 is	 also	
needed to produce indicators for objectives that can be used as a basis for developing and im-
plementing appropriate mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, with the na-
ture	of	suitable	monitoring	mechanisms	addressed	in	more	depth.	The	final	report	concluded	
by	mentioning	that	there	was	broad	agreement	that	the	root	causes	of	human	trafficking	must	
be confronted using a balanced approach, but that increased attention needs to be devoted to 
how	to	reduce	the	demand	for	trafficked	persons	in	countries	of	destination.40

Other UN activities and initiatives
Many	organisations	within	the	UN	have	launched	activities	to	tackle	human	trafficking	or	are	
involved in the activities of other international organisations. These include activities support-
ed by governments and other stakeholders at a national level in areas such as coordination;41 
data collection, research, studies and support of policy formulation; preventive measures;42 as-
sistance in the drafting of legislation;43 activities for victims; and capacity building.44

Handbook Combating Forced Labour: A Handbook for Employers and Business (October 2008), UN Doc. A/
HRC/10/64 (2009).

43 UNODC has for example drafted model legislation based on the UN Protocol, the UNODC Model Law 
against Trafficking in Persons,	 30	 June	2009,	http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Model_
Law_against_TIP.pdf.	UNICEF	and	IPU	have	jointly	written	the	Handbook for Parliamentarians: Combating 
Child Trafficking (2005). The ILO has provided technical advice to several countries on legislative proposals 
concerning	migration,	including	human	trafficking.

44 An interesting aspect of this latter theme is that UN peacekeeping operations are also engaged in countering 
human	trafficking.	The	UN	mission	in	Liberia	(UNMIL)	is,	for	example,	revising	a	Liberian	bill	to	help	ensure	
that children cannot be fraudulently adopted outside Liberia, UN Doc. A/HRC/10/64 (2009), pp. 9-10. Under 
Dutch	 legislation,	 trafficking	 in	children	without	 the	 intention	of	exploitation	 is	not	punishable	as	human	
trafficking	(NRM5).	Rules	for	inter-country	adoption	are	laid	down	in	the	Act	on	acquiring	foreign	children	
for adoption (Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees 2008, 425). The Optional Protocol on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (Bulletin of Treaties 
2001, 103 (2002)) requires states to criminalise the purchase or sale of children if there is exploitation or the 
intent thereto, article 3, section 1, subsection a (i) of the Protocol. Section 1 subsection a (ii) of the same article

The	Office	of	the	High	Commissioner	for	Human	Rights	(OHCHR)	says	that	coordination	
could be improved by creating an independent and adequately resourced secretariat to lay 
the groundwork for cooperation between organisations. The development and implemen-
tation of national action plans for a series of related subjects – such as forced labour, child 
labour	and	human	trafficking	–	is	one	area	in	which	such	cooperation	could	contribute	to	
more	efficient	use	of	resources,	according	to	the	OHCHR.45 The question is whether exist-
ing organisations and structures could not be used.

3.3.5 Human Rights Council

Universal periodic reviews
The universal periodic review is a relatively new instrument used by the UN Human Rights 
Council, which was established in 2006, to analyse the human rights records of all 192 UN 
member	states	every	four	years.	Human	trafficking	is	one	of	the	topics	discussed	during	the	
sessions with almost every state that has taken part in the process up to now. The country 
reports for most states have contained a recommendation for the state to address the subject 
of	human	trafficking.46

The national report written by the Netherlands in 2008 for its universal periodic review by 
the	UN	Human	Rights	Council	contained	a	lengthy	section	on	human	trafficking.47 During 
the UN Human Rights Council session in April 2008 the State Secretary for Justice gave a 
briefing	on	the	national	report	and	was	questioned	about	it.	The	subject	of	human	traffick-
ing was raised more than once. The Council made 31 recommendations to the Netherlands, 
some	of	which	also	concerned	subjects	relating	to	human	trafficking	(see	below).48

One of the recommendations (No. 3) concerned the legalisation of prostitution. Egypt recom-
mended that the legalisation of (the exploitation of) prostitution should be reconsidered, given 
the impact of legalisation on a wide range of rights. The Netherlands said in response that the 
regulation of the sex industry allows the government to exercise more control over the industry 
and to tackle abuses, that this approach is in the interests of sex workers and that legalisation 
facilitates	action	against	sexual	violence,	sexual	abuse	and	human	trafficking.	The	government	
has announced new measures relating to control and enforcement of the law and will provide 
special protection and care for victims and for women who want to leave the sex industry. The 
Netherlands therefore did not support this recommendation.

says that states must insert ‘improperly inducing consent, as an intermediary, for the adoption of a child in 
violation of applicable international legal instruments on adoption’ in their criminal law.

Another recommendation – from Bangladesh – was that demand in the country of destination 
(the	Netherlands)	should	be	addressed	if	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking	are	to	be	success-
ful. The Netherlands endorsed this recommendation, referring in that context to a campaign 
to raise awareness among employers, measures to strengthen the Labour Inspectorate and the 
SIOD and transnational cooperation between countries of destination and countries of origin 
such as Nigeria. But the Netherlands also referred to the need for push and pull factors to be 
addressed by both countries of origin and countries of destination.
Algeria	also	recommended	an	in-depth	investigation	into	human	trafficking	and	exploitation	
of children, particularly with respect to sexual abuse, child prostitution and child pornography. 
The Netherlands supported this recommendation and said that it had already been implement-
ed. The Netherlands referred to various studies by bodies such as ECPAT49 and the Ministry of 
Justice and to the reports of the NRM and annual reports of CoMensha.

Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking
At the request of the Human Rights Council,50 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 
published a report in February 2009 on the most recent developments in the United Nations 
with	regard	to	combating	human	trafficking.51 The report not only contains a comprehensive 
overview of UN activities and initiatives, but also highlights the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking.52

These principles and guidelines were drawn up in 2002 and provide a framework for good 
practice	as	well	as	more	specific	and	detailed	advice	for	states	on	subjects	such	as	 legisla-
tion,	the	prosecution	of	human	trafficking	and	the	protection	of	and	help	for	victims.	The	
UN High Commissioner observed in her report that the Principles and Guidelines are fre-
quently used and cited, particularly by the UN agencies most closely concerned with human 
trafficking53 and by NGOs.54 It was felt, however, that additional information was needed 
and, for that reason, since 2008 the OHCHR had been drafting a detailed commentary on 
the Principles and Guidelines, which was due to be published in 2009.55

in Women (GAATW) as some of the organisations that adhere to the principles and guidelines in their re-
search and campaigns.

Importantly, the UN High Commissioner noted in relation to the Principles and Guidelines 
that at every step of every response ‘the human rights impact of that step and of the overall 
response must be considered and monitored’.56 According to the report, the ultimate aim of 
responses	to	human	trafficking	should	be	to	prevent	it,	to	protect	individuals	against	human	
trafficking-related	violations	of	their	rights	and	to	offer	help	whenever	such	violations	are	
not or cannot be avoided. In its conclusions, it warns that some measures against human 
trafficking	actually	harmed	the	people	they	were	intended	to	protect,	since	victims	of	human	
trafficking	sometimes	suffer	‘collateral	damage’	from	(criminal)	enforcement;	human	rights	
must	be	central	to	any	credible	strategy	against	human	trafficking.

While	 some	measures	 against	human	 trafficking	do	benefit	 certain	groups,	 they	 can	also	
stigmatise others or curtail the freedom of movement of some groups. Measures can also 
be counter-productive with respect to groups that should actually be protected. This, in a 
nutshell, is the conclusion of the report published in 2007 by the Global Alliance Against 
Trafficking in Women (GAATW) entitled Collateral Damage: The Impact of Anti-Trafficking 
Measures Around the World (www.gaatw.org.).

Measures	and	policies	designed	to	combat	human	trafficking	can	have	a	negative	effect	on	the	
people they are intended to protect. The reasons given are that states often give greater priority 
to national security, tackling crime and safeguarding national borders against illegal migrants 
over	the	rights	of	trafficked	persons.	For	example,	the	Indian	government	regarded	female	mi-
grants as a particularly vulnerable group and therefore promulgated a rule prohibiting every 
female domestic worker under the age of 30 from accepting employment in Saudi Arabia under 
any circumstances, thereby depriving female migrants of the right to leave their country. To 
avoid this ban women had to rely on riskier migration routes, which made them more vulner-
able to exploitation at their destination, according to the GAATW report. Another example 
concerned a number of Brazilian women who tried to enter the EU. They were denied entry 
and	then	repatriated	because	 immigration	officials	 thought	 that	 they	 looked	 like	prostitutes	
and	were	therefore	probably	victims	of	trafficking.	Measures	of	this	type	are	couched	in	terms	
of	prevention	of	human	trafficking	but,	according	to	the	report,	constitute	violations	of	hu-
man rights, including the rights of women.57 These are examples of the negative impact that 
measures	against	human	trafficking	can	have	on	specific	groups	such	as	women	and	migrants;	
in other words on groups that are broader than the group that can be regarded as victims ac-
cording	to	the	definitions	of	human	trafficking.

The OHCHR is in fact reviewing the possibility of writing a practical guide to help states 
and	others	to	ensure	that	reactions	to	human	trafficking	are	effective	and	in	accordance	with	
international standards and existing and evolving good practices. The OHCHR also feels 
that such an instrument could give practical guidelines for evaluating national action plans 
from a human rights perspective.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

68

Special Rapporteurs
The UN Human Rights Council has appointed a number of special rapporteurs who pro-
duce	reports	on	specific	aspects	of	human	trafficking	as	well	as	country	reports.	They	in-
clude the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children,58 the 
Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography,59 the 
Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences, 60and the Special 
Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants. 61 In Resolution 6/14, the Human Rights Coun-
cil created a new mandate for a Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery62 to 
replace the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery.63 Various rapporteurs hold 
regular meetings to avoid duplication of work and to plan joint initiatives.
The Human Rights Council’s predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, decided in 
2004 to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and childrenNRM5.64 The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on traf-
ficking in persons, especially women and children was extended for a period of three years by 
Resolution 8/12 (18 June 2008).65 The rapporteur submitted her latest annual report to the 
Human Rights Council in February 2009.66

In her report, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking on human beings, especially women and 
children	identified	a	number	of	developments.	For	example,	she	observed	that	the	complex	
phenomenon	of	human	 trafficking	has	become	even	more	 insidious	because	of	 its	 covert	
nature and increasingly because of the growing use of modern information technology as 
an	instrument	for	recruiting	victims.	She	also	explicitly	mentioned	that	human	trafficking	
within national borders occurs on a large scale.

Estimates of the number of victims by various organisations and agencies vary and, accord-
ing to the rapporteur, indicate the need for the systematic and coordinated collection and 
management of data to provide certainty about the scale of the problem. In the absence of 
systematic	and	reliable	figures,	it	is	difficult	to	say	with	any	precision	whether	the	number	
of	human	trafficking	cases	is	rising	or	falling	or	why.	What	is	clear	is	that	there	is	a	global	
consensus	that	human	trafficking	takes	many	different	forms	and	that	it	is	a	serious	violation	
of human rights as well as a violation of national and international criminal law. The Special 
Rapporteur said that her aim was to improve the exchange of information and possibilities

for data collection67 and that she intended to act as a contact person for gathering and dis-
seminating data.

Human	trafficking	can	be	approached	from	a	number	of	different	perspectives,	 including	
human rights, criminal law, migration and labour. However, the Special Rapporteur prefers 
an integrated approach, saying that as far as her mandate is concerned she feels that human 
rights should be the focus of all efforts. The Special Rapporteur’s mandate encompasses 
every	form	and	manifestation	of	human	trafficking.	Her	report	provides	a	summary	(pre-
sented below) to explain what that means:

(1)	Trafficking	in	children	–	children	who	are	trafficked	for	sexual	purposes,	adoption,	child	
labour (e.g., domestic work, babysitters/nannies, begging, criminal activities like selling drugs, 
etc.)	and	participation	in	armed	conflict	–	mercenaries/child	soldiers,	sex	slaves.	The	initial	be-
lief	that	only	girl	children	were	being	trafficked	for	sexual	purposes	no	longer	holds	true	as	the	
incidence	of	young	boys	being	trafficked	and	sexually	exploited	through	unsuspecting	areas	
like sports is fast gaining ground;
(2)	Trafficking	in	men	for	forced	labour	and	other	exploitation	–	not	much	attention	has	been	
paid	to	this	form	of	trafficking	but	the	reality	is	that	it	is	also	becoming	rampant.	Men	and	boys	
in	particular	are	trafficked	for	labour	exploitation	in	construction	work,	in	agriculture,	and	also	
in	fishing	and	mining;
(3)	Trafficking	in	women	and	girls	for	forced	marriage,	forced	prostitution,	sexual	exploitation	
and forced labour (including domestic work, working in factories and mines and other forms of 
labour)	–	understandably,	much	attention	has	been	paid	to	sex	trafficking	and	available	data	on	
trafficking	in	persons	are	mainly	on	this	subject.	The	Special	Rapporteur	will	explore	further	
trafficking	of	women	for	labour	exploitation,	especially	in	domestic	work	and	other	sectors;
(4)	Trafficking	in	human	beings	for	organs,	human	body	parts	and	tissue	–	obtaining	facts	and	
figures	on	this	form	of	trafficking	is	quite	challenging,	but	it	is	becoming	a	growing	trend	with	a	
ready market, and need to be studied closely with a view to framing appropriate interventions;
(5)	There	are	other	forms	that	have	been	sporadically	recorded,	such	as	trafficking	in	persons	
for	ritual	purposes	as	well	as	trafficking	of	prisoners.

She also intends to extend her agenda to embrace a number of subjects that she regards as 
crucial	in	relation	to	human	trafficking.	These	include	not	only	the	lack	of	research	and	data,	
but	 also	migration	 and	 connections	with	human	 trafficking,	with	HIV	and	AIDS,	 armed	
conflicts,	the	Millennium Development Goals,68 gender-related violence and gender inequal-
ity,	 in-depth	research	into	the	demand	for	victims	of	human	trafficking,	facilities	for	inte-
grated help and services for victims and the promotion of international, regional and sub-
regional cooperation. Her main aim is to launch activities in areas that have not previously 
been studied or where interventions have been limited up to now. Examples would be human 
trafficking	were	men	and	boys	are	victims	and	the	root	causes	of	human	trafficking,	such	as	

67 See Resolution 8/12, para. 2 (k), which she also refers to.
68 In 2000, 189 countries signed the Millennium Declaration, promising to actively combat global poverty. 

Eight	specific	and	measurable	objectives,	the	Millennium	Development	Goals	(MDGs),	were	formulated	to	
be achieved by 2015.

gender inequality, poverty, a lack of security and demand for cheap labour. Another issue 
specifically	mentioned	as	requiring	attention	is	the	question	of	compensation	for	victims.
Using a questionnaire,69 the Special Rapporteur collected information from various coun-
tries	about	human	trafficking.	She	concluded	from	the	responses	that	most	countries	have	
made	human	trafficking	in	the	sex	industry	a	criminal	offence	but	that	few	countries	have	
done	so	with	regard	to	human	trafficking	in	other	sectors	(trafficking	for	forced	labour)	or	
with	respect	to	human	trafficking	where	the	victims	are	men.	And,	although	many	countries	
have	ratified	the	UN	Palermo	Protocol,70 according to the Special Rapporteur its implemen-
tation is generally weak due to the absence of comprehensive national legislation, a lack of re-
sources for enforcement and a lack of political will. In her conclusions, she states that strate-
gies	against	human	trafficking	should	not	be	confined	to	punishing	perpetrators	but	should	
focus to an equal extent on victims, while at the same time addressing the root causes of 
human	trafficking.	States	are	called	on	to	sign	up	to	the	UN	Protocol	and	to	the	UN	Conven-
tion on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.71 States should 
observe	the	OHCHR’s	Principles	and	Guidelines	on	Human	Rights	and	Human	Traffick-
ing72 and incorporate them in their legislation and policies to address all forms of human 
trafficking.	States	 should	give	all	 trafficked	persons	access	 to	 specialist	 support	and	help,	
regardless of their status under immigration law. According to the Special Rapporteur, issu-
ing a temporary or permanent residence permit and/or providing access to assistance should 
not depend on cooperation with criminal procedures. States should consider appointing a 
national rapporteur who would work closely with the Special Rapporteur in collecting, shar-
ing and processing information and monitoring measures. Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed	support	for	a	global	action	plan	to	combat	human	trafficking.73

The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, its causes and consequences pre-
sented	her	first	report	in	July	2008,	a	few	months	after	she	was	appointed74. In this report, 
she mentions the areas she will focus her attention on: the root causes and consequences of 
forced labour and its impact on men, women and children. She will also devote special atten-
tion to domestic work and child labour. Like the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, she also intends to adopt a gender- and age-sensitive approach 
in her work.

69 In October 2008 the rapporteur sent a questionnaire to UN member states to gather information for the 
purposes of her future work and to set priorities. According to her report at the beginning of 2009, she 
received replies from 68 countries.

In	performing	her	task,	the	Special	Rapporteur	will	use	the	definitions	in	the	Slavery Conven-
tion of 192675 and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade 
and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956.76 Given the changes in economic and 
social conditions since the conventions took effect, the Special Rapporteur also takes into 
account	definitions	adopted	later	by	the	UN	and	other	organisations.77

To clarify her mandate, she also refers to the persistence of old forms of slavery that are embed-
ded in traditional convictions and customs. She notes in this context that these forms of slav-
ery are the result of enduring discrimination of the most vulnerable groups in society, such as 
those who are regarded as being of a low caste, tribal minorities and indigenous populations.
The	Special	Rapporteur	concludes	by	saying	that	during	her	period	in	office	she	will	make	
specific	recommendations,	mainly	on	ways	of	preventing	slavery	and	protecting	the	rights	
and human dignity of enslaved persons. She will also devote attention to old – but still exist-
ing – forms of slavery, such as bonded labour and serfdom.

3.3.6 Supervision mechanisms based on human rights treaties

Some UN treaties and protocols have established mechanisms to supervise compliance by 
member states with the obligations they have assumed by virtue of these international hu-
man	rights	documents.	Human	trafficking	and	measures	to	address	it	are	regularly	discussed	
in the country reports produced by these bodies formed under human rights treaties, includ-
ing the legislation and practice in the Netherlands. These bodies generally express concern 

75 Bulletin of Treaties	1928,	26.	Article	1,	paragraph	1	defines	slavery	as	‘the status or condition of a person over 
whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised.’ Slavery	is	defined	as	‘all	acts	
involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with the intent to reduce him to slavery’.

76 Bulletin of Treaties 1957, 118. Article 1 requires states to abolish a number of practices related to slavery, in-
cluding ‘(a) Debt bondage, that is to say, the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his 
personal services or those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those services 
as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those 
services	are	not	respectively	limited	and	defined;	(b)	Serfdom,	that	is	to	say,	the	condition	or	status	of	a	ten-
ant who is by law, custom or agreement bound to live and labour on land belonging to another person and 
to render some determinate service to such a person, whether for reward or not, and is not free to change 
his status; (c) Any institution or practice whereby: (i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or 
given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any 
other person or group; or (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to 
another person for value received or otherwise; or (iii) A women on the death of her husband is liable to be 
inherited by another person; (d) Any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age 
of 18 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person, whether 
for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young persons or of his labour.’

77	 Accordingly,	slavery	is	also	defined	as	‘any	form	of	dealing	with	human	beings	leading	to	the	forced	exploita-
tion of their labour’, in the report of the Special Rapporteur of the former Sub-commission on Prevention of 
discrimination and Protection of Minorities, UN Doc. E/CN.4/Sub.2/1982/20/Add.1, 7 July 1982, and ‘enslave-
ment’	as	‘the	exercise	of	any	or	all	of	the	powers	in	the	course	of	trafficking	in	persons,	in	particular	women	
and children’, see, for example, article 7, section 2, subsection c of the Charter of the International Criminal 
Court.

at	the	continued	existence	of	human	trafficking	despite	the	fact	that	states	have	passed	legis-
lation and adopted national action plans and other measures against it.

 – The Human Rights Committee, which supervises compliance with the International Con-
vention on Civil and Political Rights,78	has	repeatedly	found	that	human	trafficking	is	a	
possible violation of article 3 (equal rights of men and women), article 8 (ban on slavery 
and forced or mandatory labour), article 24 (right to protection of the child), and article 
26 (ban on discrimination) of the Convention. The committee has also acknowledged the 
risk	of	the	negative	effects	that	measures	against	human	trafficking	can	have	on	the	rights	
and	freedoms	of	trafficked	persons.	The	committee	feels	that	victims	of	human	traffick-
ing should be allowed to stay in a country regardless of whether they cooperate with a 
prosecution.79 The committee discussed the report on the Netherlands in July 200980 
and	one	of	the	topics	it	raised	was	the	approach	to	human	trafficking	in	the	Netherlands.	
The committee was positive about the existence of the National Action Plan on Human 
Trafficking	(2004)	and	the	establishment	of	the	Human	Trafficking	Task	Force	(2008).81

 – The Committee against Torture has referred to the importance of providing help for vic-
tims	of	human	trafficking	purely	on	the	basis	of	their	needs,	regardless	of	whether	they	
cooperate with criminal investigations.82 With respect to Aruba, the committee ex-
pressed its concern at the lack of information about existing mechanisms for preventing 
and	prosecuting	human	trafficking.83

 – The	UN	Women’s	Convention	explicitly	prohibits	human	trafficking	and	forced	pros-
titution of women.84 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW Committee) under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Dis-
crimination against Women is concerned about the practice in a number of countries 
of making the awarding of residence permits dependent on the victim’s willingness to 
cooperate with the authorities.85 The CEDAW Committee’s recommendations for the 
Netherlands were published in February 2007.86

With respect to the Netherlands, the CEDAW Committee expressed concern about, among 
other	things,	the	number	of	women	and	girls	that	are	victims	of	human	trafficking.	The	com-
mittee also encouraged the Netherlands to conduct independent research into the effects of 
the abolition of the ban on brothels on foreign prostitutes, in particular, with special attention 
to the risks of violence and to health (a second evaluation of the abolition of the ban on broth-
els had, however, already been completed in 2007). The committee also recommended that all 
victims	of	human	trafficking	should	be	offered	protection	and	help,	including	granting	them	
temporary residence permits. According to the committee, this should also apply for victims 
who are not willing to cooperate with a prosecution of the perpetrators. In its reaction, the 
Netherlands said that the policy does not provide for a general right to residence for victims 
as such but that it does allow humanitarian aspects to be taken into account, including the fact 
that a person is a victim. Persons granted residence on these grounds can be offered protection 
and help.
The	Netherlands	addressed	these	issues	at	length	in	the	fifth	report	to	the	CEDAW	Committee	
(see the Fifth Periodic Report of the Netherlands, UN Doc. CEDAW/C/NLD/4, 24 November 
2008), which the committee plans to discuss in 2010. In response to the Dutch report, the com-
mittee asked – in light of the concerns expressed earlier about the link between the protection of 
victims and their cooperation with criminal investigations – whether the Netherlands will offer 
temporary	residence	permits	and	reintegration	and	support	for	victims	of	human	trafficking	
irrespective of whether they cooperate with an investigation and prosecution of suspected hu-
man	traffickers	(see	List of issues and questions with regard to the consideration of periodic reports, 
The Netherlands, UN Doc. CEDAW/C/NLD/Q/5, 13 March 2009). The committee asked what 
measures	had	been	taken	to	ensure	that	female	victims	of	human	trafficking	are	properly	identi-
fied	and	no	longer	held	in	aliens’	detention.	The	committee	wanted	to	know	whether	underage	
victims have access to specialist agencies and whether an investigation into the disappearance 
of	underage	asylum	seekers	who	are	suspected	of	falling	into	the	hands	of	human	traffickers	had	
been completed. The committee also asked the Netherlands to explain why NGOs were not 
represented	on	the	Human	Trafficking	Task	Force.	Finally,	as	far	as	it	is	relevant	in	this	context,	
the committee posed a number of questions about the pending Regulation of Prostitution Act. 
In this context, the committee wondered in particular how the Netherlands had evaluated the 
risks to privacy and safety of compulsory registration of prostitutes with local authorities, and 
the impact of the legislation on the possibility for these women to work independently.

 – The CEDAW Committee published its General Recommendation on Women Migrants 
Workers in November 2008.87	Although	the	recommendations	do	not	specifically	refer	
to	human	trafficking,	many	parts	of	the	document	are	also	relevant	to	situations	where	
female	migrants	are	victims	of	human	trafficking.88

 – The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the trade in children with a 
view to exploitation, sexual exploitation and child labour. The Optional Protocol to the 

87 General Recommendation No. 26 on Women Migrant Workers, 7 November 2008, see http://www2.ohchr.
org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/general_recommendation/GR26MigrantWomen.pdf.

88 According to La Strada, these General Recommendations precisely describe the vulnerable position of fe-
male migrants and offer solutions that address the causes rather than symptoms, ‘an approach commonly 
lacking	in	anti-trafficking	policies’,	La	Strada	Newsletter,	no.	11,	December	2008,	p.	5.

Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography contains 
provisions	relating	to	human	trafficking	that	are	also	very	relevant	for	the	Netherlands.89

 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has raised the issue of unaccompanied and sepa-
rated underage children, in a General Comment, for example, in which it referred to the 
risk	of	human	trafficking	or	‘re-trafficking’.90

In 2008 the Netherlands submitted its reports on the Optional Protocol on the sale of chil-
dren, child prostitution and child pornography to the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, UN Doc. CRC/C/OPSC/NLD/I, 8 January. In a reaction in January 2009, the commit-
tee said that the Dutch government should intensify its efforts to prevent minors from becom-
ing victims of (sexual) exploitation, for example by improving registration and by conduct-
ing more research into child pornography, youth prostitution and child sex tourism. It said 
the government should draw up a cohesive national action plan to tackle the exploitation of 
children, sexual or otherwise. Underage victims of (sexual) exploitation should receive better 
protection. Social workers, police and prosecutors should receive special training in how to 
meet the special needs of minors. The government should provide specialist shelter and help 
for underage victims. Perpetrators should be prosecuted more strenuously. Cooperation with 
other countries should also improve. The Dutch police should be assigned more manpower, 
knowledge and resources, see Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Netherlands, UN Doc. CRC/C/NLD/CO/3, and 
UN Doc. CRC/C/OPSC/NLD/CO/I, 30 January 2009.
In the government’s response to the UN Committee’s report, the Minister for Youth and Fam-
ily said that the Netherlands would take the committee’s recommendations to heart. With re-
spect to recommendations relating to the detention of unaccompanied underage aliens, the 
minister explained that this instrument is only used if there is no adequate milder alternative. 
The minister referred to the pilot scheme launched in 2008 in which possible victims of hu-
man	trafficking	are	housed	in	sheltered	accommodation	in	small-scale	reception	centres	(see	§	
4.6). The government also intends to continue the special reintegration programmes for unac-
companied	underage	aliens	and	victims	of	human	trafficking.	The	committee	asked	the	Neth-
erlands	to	collect	data	on	child	trafficking,	child	prostitution	and	child	pornography	on	a	sys-
tematic	basis.	The	National	Rapporteur	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	already	gathers	data	
on	the	first	two	subjects.	In	relation	to	child	pornography,	the	minister	said	that	programmes	
already underway would improve the systematic collection of data by the police and the public 
prosecution service, starting in 2010. The minister also said in the reaction that motions had 
been submitted in parliament calling for sex with minors in other countries to be actively ad-
dressed and that there is an active policy to tackle child pornography couriers (Parliamentary 
Documents II 2008/09, 31 001, no. 66).

89	 The	Optional	Protocol	was	signed	by	the	Netherlands	on	7	September	2000	and	ratified	on	23	August	2005.	
On 23 September 2005, the Protocol entered into force (Bulletin of Treaties 2001, 130). In this context see 
also the 2007 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and 
Sexual Abuse (Convention of Lanzarote) (Bulletin of Treaties	2008,	58).	The	Netherlands	has	not	yet	ratified	
this treaty, see § 3.5.3.

 – The UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Fami-
lies91 is intended to ensure equal treatment for migrants, including working conditions 
equal to those of a state’s own subjects. The Convention can play an important role in 
tackling the exploitation of migrants because it also refers to the prevention of inhumane 
living and working conditions, physical and sexual abuse and humiliating treatment, in-
cluding slavery, subservience and forced or mandatory labourNRM5.92 The Committee on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which 
was founded in 2004, consists of independent experts who monitor the implementation 
of the treaty.

 The Netherlands is not a party to this convention.93 However, calls to accede to the con-
vention have been supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,94 the Spe-
cial Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings,95 the CEDAW Committee,96 CERD97 
and some NGOs.98 During the universal periodic review conducted by the UN Human 
Rights Council, a number of countries recommended that the Netherlands should ratify 
the convention.99 In its response, the Netherlands reiterated its position that it could not 
support this recommendation ‘because it is opposed in principle to rights that could be 
derived from it by aliens without legal residence rights’.100

 It is in any case clear that illegal migrants are particularly vulnerable to various forms of 
exploitation, particularly women – often in domestic work – and children.101

91 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their 
Families, A/RES/45/158, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 1990. The Netherlands is 
not a party to this instrument.

92 See also article 11 of the UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrants and Members of their Families.
93 The number of member states has risen from 20 to 42 since the entry into force of the Convention on 1 July 

2003 (situation as of 11 September 2009). However, they do not include any countries of destination of mi-
grants. The Netherlands does not propose ratifying the treaty because the absence of a distinction between 
legal and illegal migrant workers in awarding rights is not compatible with the point of departure of the 
Benefit	Entitlement	(Residence	Status)	Act,	see	NRM3,	p.	46	and	NRM5.

94 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (at that time Louise Arbour), Statement to the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe, 18 April 2007; ‘It is imperative that more European countries sign, 
ratify or accede to this Convention, which to a large extent simply makes explicit for migrants many of the 
rights already set out elsewhere in binding treaties.’

3.4 European Union

3.4.1 Implementation of EU Action Plan

The EU plan on best practices, standards and procedure for combating and preventing traf-
ficking in human beings	(further	referred	to	as	the	Human	Trafficking	Action	Plan),102 was 
evaluated by the European Commission at the end of 2008. The Council of Ministers of 
Justice and Home Affairs had asked the Commission to evaluate the action plan in order 
to	ensure	that	efforts	to	combat	human	trafficking	would	continue	in	2008.103 The 2005 
action plan consists of a list of actions relating to the coordination of EU efforts, the iden-
tification	of	problems,	prevention,	 the	 reduction	of	demand,	 investigation	and	prosecu-
tion, the protection of and assistance for victims, repatriation, reintegration and external 
relations NRM5.
In December 2007, the Commission asked the member states for updated information about 
the	implementation	of	national	policies	to	tackle	human	trafficking.	Twenty-three	member	
states and Norway complied with this request. The Commission also consulted other bodies 
responsible for implementing a number of items in the action plan, including Europol.
The Commission’s evaluation104 showed that many countries have now adopted legislation 
relating to prosecution and protection of and help for victims. The legislation frequently 
involves	the	expansion	of	national	criminal	law	to	encompass	human	trafficking	in	sectors	
other than the sex industry.
However, the available information shows that there is a wide gap between the legislation and 
its implementation in practice. The Commission observed that the number of prosecutions 
is still not high enough and emphasised the serious lack of effective implementation in terms 
of protection of victims. As far as national legislation is concerned, the Commission found, 
for example, that victims are not adequately protected from prosecution or criminal sanc-
tions	for	criminal	offences	committed	as	a	result	of	their	situation	as	trafficked	persons.	Ac-
cording	to	the	Commission,	the	available	figures	show	that	in	countries	where	a	significant	
number of victims did receive help the number of prosecutions was higher.105 This implies, 
according to the Commission, that a human rights approach is necessary not only to protect 
victims, but is also in the interests of justice. In this document the Commission announced a 
review	of	the	framework	decision	on	human	trafficking,	partly	with	a	view	to	guaranteeing	
more effective mechanisms for helping victims.

In	light	of	these	findings,	the	Commission	made	a	number	of	recommendations	for	the	short	
term (see below). These recommendations are addressed to member states, Europol, Eu-
rojust, the EU Presidency and the European Commission itself. In addition, a new A new 
strategy will be formulated at the end of 2009.

 – One recommendation concerns the establishment of an institute of national rapporteurs or 
equivalent	mechanisms	to	monitor	 trends	 in	human	trafficking	and	the	results	of	policies	
and	measures	against	human	trafficking.

 – National mechanisms for identifying and referring victims to social services should be estab-
lished or improved; they should be based on agreements between law enforcement agencies 
and civil society organisations and should adopt a gender perspective and human rights ap-
proach.

 – Systems of child protection should be set up or strengthened to facilitate effective investiga-
tions	into	whether	there	are	reasons	to	suspect	that	there	may	be	human	trafficking	–	beg-
ging and illegal activities are explicitly mentioned as forms of exploitation.

 – NGOs	that	offer	help	to	victims	should	receive	support	and	be	given	adequate	financial	re-
sources. Efforts by NGOs to establish a more permanent network should be supported, and 
such a network should be recognised as an important consultative partner.

 – Europol,	Cepol	and	members	states	should	organise	systematic	training	for	key	figures	in-
volved	in	identifying	human	trafficking	cases,	with	special	attention	for	exploitation	outside	
the sex industry.

 – Coordination of criminal investigation and prosecution should be improved, including pro-
moting the use of Europol and Eurojust’s resources.

 – Current action with respect to external relations should be improved, for example by remov-
ing obstacles to legal cooperation in criminal cases, particularly with authorities in the west-
ern Balkans, the eastern neighbours of the EU and countries in North Africa.

3.4.2 European Commission’s Group of Experts

In 2008 the European Commission established a new Group of Experts on Trafficking in Hu-
man Beings.106 The 21 members serve in a personal capacity and have different backgrounds. 
A number of participants are government representatives; others come from NGOs, Eu-
ropol, international organisations and academia. They are experts with experience in tack-
ling	human	trafficking,	with	particular	emphasis	on	the	aspect	of	labour	exploitation.	For	
the time being, there are no members from trade unions or employers’ organisations. The 
members are appointed for a period of three years.

The task of the Group of Experts is to advise the European Commission on human traf-
ficking	and	to	publish	reports	and	opinions	on	the	subject.	Its	working	programme	includes	
providing	advice	on	the	reform	of	the	EU	framework	decision	on	human	trafficking,	on	the	
drafting	of	a	new	EU	strategy	for	tackling	human	trafficking	and	on	the	Directive	on	tempo-

Human Beings (2008/604/EC).

rary residence permits NRM5.107 The Commission can ask the Group of Experts for advice, but 
the group can also submit advice and reports to the Commission on its own initiative. The 
group’s chairperson can also advise the Commission to consult the group on a particular 
issue.108

In October 2007, the European Commission decided to form a new Group of Experts to 
continue	the	tasks	of	the	first	Expert Group, which was appointed in 2003NRM5. A number of 
members	from	the	first	group	are	also	in	the	current	Group	of	Experts.	The	Group	of	Ex-
perts has meanwhile published opinions on Directive 2004/81, the Commission’s proposed 
reform	of	the	Framework	Decision	against	trafficking	in	Human	Beings	and	the	European	
Anti-Trafficking	Day	(18	October).
The Group of Experts has said that existing Directive 2004/81 does not adequately address 
the legitimate needs and rights of victims to support and help, in particular the fact that 
granting a residence permit and related help depends on the victim’s cooperation with rel-
evant national procedures.109

According to the Group of Experts, the principal aim of the new Directive should be to extend 
the grounds on which member states can grant residence permits to subjects of third countries 
who	are	victims	of	human	trafficking.	Secondly,	subjects	of	EU	member	states	(like	subjects	of	
third	countries	who	are	living	legally	in	the	EU),	who	are	victims	of	human	trafficking	should	
have equal access to the possibilities and rights afforded by the Directive.
The Group of Experts also feels that the scope of the Directive should be limited to human 
trafficking.	The	current	Directive	covers	human	smuggling,	a	different	offence	that	includes	
an element of consent on the part of the person who is smuggled over a border. In the case of 
human	trafficking,	there	is	no	question	of	consent.	Different	measures	are	called	for	in	tackling	
the two offences, as well as in terms of the help and protection needed by victims. A new Direc-
tive should also apply to children. A legal guardian should be appointed for this purpose and 
any	measure	should	put	the	child’s	interests	first. 110

The Group of Experts feels it is essential that a new Directive should oblige member states to 
adopt	measures	to	promote	the	early	and	effective	identification	of	trafficked	persons.
Member	states	should	comply	with	their	duty	to	inform	victims	of	human	trafficking	of	their	
rights in a language and in a manner that the person concerned understands. The current pro-
vision	on	 the	period	of	 reflection	needs	 to	be	strengthened.	The	reflection	period,	which	 is	
also intended to allow victims to recover, should be granted immediately to those persons who 
have	been	found	to	have	been	victims	of	human	trafficking	or	of	whom	there	are	indications

that they have: ‘It should be assumed, until established otherwise, that the individual has been 
trafficked.’	The	reflection	period	should	not	be	less	then	three	months.
The Group of Experts also feels that granting a residence permit, for a least one year, should 
not	depend	on	the	trafficked	person’s	participation	in	the	criminal	proceedings	against	alleged	
human	traffickers.	With	a	human	rights	approach,	a	residence	permit	should	also	be	granted	
on the basis of the victim’s personal situation, regardless of the relevant national procedures: 
‘The	trafficked	person	should	not	be	treated	as	an	 instrument	for	the	prosecution.’	 In	cases	
where a victim does cooperate, the validity or duration of a residence permit should not de-
pend on the outcome of the criminal proceedings.
Subjects of EU member states should be entitled to at least the same assistance and the same 
rights as provided to subjects of third countries Finally, the Group of Experts refers to the fact 
that in addition to this Directive, member states may also be bound by international obliga-
tions to provide protection such as those laid down in Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 
2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals or stateless 
persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection in the content of the 
protection granted (OJ L 304/12).

18	October	has	been	designated	the	European	Anti-Trafficking	Day.	The	Group	of	Experts	
made a number of suggestions for themes that should be given priority in this third year of 
the event. More needs to be done to increase public awareness of the problem of human 
trafficking,	particularly	of	exploitation	in	sectors	other	than	the	sex	industry.	The	group	also	
referred	to	the	status	of	nationals	of	EU	member	states	who	are	victims	of	human	trafficking	
in other EU member states or third countries. According to the Group of Experts, there are 
major differences in the degree of assistance provided for this group of victims.111

3.4.3 Council’s conclusions on the establishment of a network of national 
rapporteurs

In June 2009 the Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on establishing an 
informal	EU	network	of	national	rapporteurs	or	equivalent	mechanisms	on	trafficking	 in	
human beings. The document invited every member state to participate in an informal and 
flexible	network	whose	task	would	be	to	increase	understanding	of	the	phenomenon	of	hu-
man	trafficking	and	provide	the	EU	and	member	states	with	objective,	reliable	and	compara-
ble	up-to-date	strategic	information	on	human	trafficking.112

According to the Council’s conclusions, the network should be open to EU bodies and EU 
agencies. Relevant international bodies, such as the OSCE, UNODC, IMO, ILO and the 
UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the IC-
MPD could be invited as observers.

80

Other agencies, such as the UN Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution 
and Child Pornography and the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery 
could perhaps also be invited to join the network.

An important aspect of these conclusions is that every member state is (again) invited to 
appoint a national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism. National rapporteurs or equivalent 
mechanisms are particularly invited to share best practices and experiences at the national 
and European level, contribute to existing efforts to develop indicators and criteria to im-
prove the comparability and consistency of information and assist in developing new activi-
ties	relating	to	the	collection	of	statistics	on	human	trafficking.	National	rapporteurs	are	also	
invited to help collect and analyse essential quantitative and qualitative information about 
human	trafficking	gathered	by	national	rapporteurs	during	their	activities.

The intention is that the European Commission will support the network and report on its 
progress. The EU presidency, in association with the Commission, will coordinate the ac-
tivities of the network and chair the meetings.
The	first	 steps	 in	 creating	 a	network	of	national	 rapporteurs	 and	 equivalent	mechanisms	
were already taken during Sweden’s presidency, in Brussels.113 It is not yet clear how the net-
work will evolve in the future.

3.4.4 Draft Framework Decision on human trafficking

In March 2009 the European Commission adopted two proposals for new framework de-
cisions.114 One proposal was for an amendment of the Framework Decision on the sexual 
exploitation of children, sexual abuse and child pornography;115 the other was for an amend-
ment	of	 the	Framework	Decision	on	human	trafficking.116 Both proposals are intended to 
bring European legislation into line with the conventions that have already been adopted by 
the Council of Europe on these subjects.117

The intention is that the European Council will adopt the Framework Decision on human 
trafficking	before	the	end	of	2009.

By contrast with earlier framework decisions on relevant criminal law, the proposed Frame-
work	Decision	on	human	trafficking	not	only	contains	provisions	on	the	harmonisation	of	
relevant criminal law but also on prevention, prosecution, the rules of criminal procedure118 
and help for victims.119 Other provisions in the proposal concern the rights of victims during 
criminal proceedings and monitoring by national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms. By 
explicitly	referring	to	‘the	prevention	and	combating	of	human	trafficking	and	the	protec-
tion of victims’, the provisional title of the draft framework decision is therefore also wider 
than that of the current framework decision (2002), which does not mention the protection 
of victims.
According to the European Commission, the proposed framework decision builds on the 
Council	 of	Europe’s	Convention	 on	Action	 against	 Trafficking	 in	Human	Beings	 (2005)	
and provides added value in a number of respects. For example, the proposal contains new 
provisions on special treatment for vulnerable victims in criminal proceedings to prevent 
secondary victimisation (article 9), expands the scope of the provision concerning the non-
application of sanctions with respect to victims for their involvement in illegal activities 
(non-punishment clause, article 6), sets higher standards with regard to help for victims, par-
ticularly with respect to medical treatment (article 10), contains a more extensive and more 
binding rule on extra-territorial jurisdiction (article 8), and prescribes a level of punishment 
adapted to the seriousness of the offences (article 3). The proposal also contains new provi-
sions on criminal investigation, prevention and monitoring by national rapporteurs.

The inclusion in the EU acquis of provisions similar to the existing treaty provisions also 
yields further advantages arising from the strong binding force established by the EU’s legal 
order, according to the Commission, referring to the immediate entry into force of the pro-
visions and the supervision of compliance with them.
The	debate	on	the	proposal	for	a	new	framework	decision	on	human	trafficking	and	its	im-
plementation	must	not,	however,	be	at	the	expense	of	the	ratification	of	the	Council	of	Eu-
rope’s	Convention	on	Acton	against	Human	Trafficking	(2005).	Provisions	concerning	help	
for and protection of victims in the proposal for a new framework decision must not curtail 
what has already been achieved in the Council of Europe’s convention. The proposal for a 
new EU framework decision must also not weaken the willingness to implement the provi-
sions of the convention.

118 For example, member states must ensure that the persons, units or services responsible for investigating 
or	prosecuting	human	trafficking	possess	the	instruments	used	for	investigating	organised	crime,	such	as	
telephone	taps,	electronic	surveillance	and	financial	investigation	(article	7,	section	4	of	the	proposal).

119 It is therefore also doubted whether a number of elements of the proposal have a basis in (European) law. 
For example, binding rules with respect to investigations and the hearing of victims have never previously 
been included in a framework decision. Letter from the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of 7 May 2009,

3.4.5 Directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying 
workers

In May 2007 the European Commission presented a proposal to address the employment 
of illegal, undocumented migrants – in order to prevent illegal immigration of workers from 
third countries to the EU – and to harmonise the rules in the member states on the sanctions 
for employers who hire illegal workers.120 Besides criticism of the degree of detail in the pro-
posal, some countries, including the Netherlands, criticised the provision that at least 10% 
of all companies in a member state should be inspected every year for the presence of illegal 
workers. In mid-2007, 1.5% of companies in the Netherlands were inspected, meaning that 
under the provision the number of inspectors employed by the Labour Inspectorate would 
have to rise sharply, at an estimated cost of between 60 and 70 million euro a year.
The	Directive	was	finally	adopted	in	May	2009121 and entered into force on 20 July 2009.122

According to the Directive, EU member states must introduce effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive	sanctions	for	employers	who	hire	illegal	immigrants.	The	sanctions	can	be	fines,	
but also criminal sanctions for the illegal employment of minors, for repeated offences, for 
the	employment	of	a	significant	number	of	illegal	immigrants,	for	working	conditions	that	
are	exploitative	or	where	the	employer	knows	the	workers	are	victims	of	human	trafficking.123 
The	size	of	the	fine	depends	on	the	number	of	illegal	aliens	a	company	has	employed,	but	
employers who break the rules must also pay all social insurance contributions that have 
not already been paid. They can also be charged the costs of the repatriation of their illegal 
employees and they must also any back wages due to the employees in full, even if the em-
ployees have already been deported from the country. As an additional deterrent, the Direc-
tive	provides	that	companies	that	are	caught	may	be	disqualified	from	receiving	government	
contracts	and	subsidies	for	five	years,	and	if	the	seriousness	of	the	infringement	justifies	it,	
the establishment where the infringement occurred will be closed.
The	European	Commission’s	original	proposal	was	significantly	amended.	In	the	Commis-
sion’s proposal, a main contractor could be prosecuted if one of its subcontractors used il-
legal employees. Under the terms of the current Directive, the main contractor, and any in-
termediary contractor, can only be held liable if they were aware that the subcontractor was 
using illegal employees. The Directive provides that the member states can adopt stricter 
rules	on	liability	in	national	legislation,	and	it	no	longer	specifies	the	number	of	inspections	
that the member states must carry out.
The Directive has to be implemented in national legislation no later than 20 July 2011. Its 
implementation will probably require some Dutch laws to be amended, such as the Act on

the	Employment	of	Aliens,	 in	which	 the	principal	 sanctions	are	administrative	fines.	The	
threshold for criminal sanctions in the Directive is lower than in the Dutch legislation, nor 
does Dutch law require the employer to pay the costs of deportation of the employees. It is 
also not the Dutch government’s task to collect arrears of wages (with the exception of pay-
ments prescribed by the Minimum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act).
The government has already submitted a bill to amend the Netherlands Civil Code as it pertain 
to the liability of employers hiring employees on secondment (see Chapter 2 and § 12.5.1).

3.4.6 Agency for Fundamental Rights

On the same day that the European Commission introduced its proposals for two new 
framework decisions, the Agency for Fundamental Rights published a report on the rights of 
children.124 The agency, which is based in Vienna, was founded in 2007.125 It provides assist-
ance and expertise to the relevant bodies and authorities in the European Union, and to the 
member	states	in	the	implementation	of	Community	law,	in	the	field	of	fundamental	rights.	
The agency focuses on the EU and its 27 member states. Candidate member states and coun-
tries that have concluded a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU may be in-
vited to participate in the agency, whose activities encompass the fundamental rights set out 
in Article 6(2) of the EU Treaty.126 These are mainly the fundamental rights guaranteed by 
the European Convention on Human Rights.

At the request of the European Commission, in 2007 the agency launched the project Imple-
mentation, protection, respect and promotion of the rights of the child in the European Union.127 
The aim of the project was to formulate a set of indicators by which to regularly measure the 
extent to which the rights of children are being implemented, respected and promoted in the 
EU member states. The intention of the project is also to analyse relevant legal measures that 
have already been taken, such as statistics from courts and jurisprudence, and to produce a 
sociological analysis of relevant data.

The report Developing indicators for the protection, respect and promotion of the rights of the 
child in the European Union appeared in March 2009. This report covered four topics, includ-
ing the protection of children against exploitation and violence,128 a subject that covers child

liament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, but possesses no legal force

tivities’ and ‘adequate standard of living’.

3.4.7 The Return Directive

Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on common stand-
ards and procedures in the member states for returning nationals of third countries living in 
their territory was published in December 2008.130 This Return Directive lays down general 
standards for the (forced) repatriation of nationals of third countries who are residing il-
legally in the EU, with respect for their human rights. The directive applies unless more 
favourable provisions exist (article 4 of the Directive), including those formulated in the di-
rective	on	temporary	residence	permits	for	victims	of	human	trafficking.131 Since that direc-
tive	 applies	 to	victims	of	human	 trafficking,	 the	new	directive	will	 generally	not	 apply	 to	
themNRM5.
A	decision	to	return	a	third-country	national	 is	accompanied	by	an	entry	ban	for	up	to	five	
years. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 11, section 1, under b (the failure to comply 
with the obligation to return), and on condition that they do not form a threat to public order, 
public	safety	or	national	security,	no	entry	ban	will	be	served	on	victims	of	human	trafficking	
who have been granted residence in accordance with the Directive on temporary residence.132

However, the Return Directive does not exclude the possibility that vulnerable groups, such 
as	unaccompanied	minors	and	victims	of	human	trafficking,	will	be	detained	pending	de-
portation.133

3.4.8 Cooperation between the police and prosecution services at EU level

The Prüm Convention
The objective of the Prüm Convention134 is to intensify a number of aspects of cross-border 
cooperation with a view to combating transnational crime, terrorism and illegal migration 
more effectively.NRM5 Seven countries, including the Netherlands, have had similar agree-

ments since 2005.135 In June 2008 the European Council adopted a decision to transpose the 
most important provisions of the Prüm Convention into a decision of the European Union.136 
These provisions of the Prüm Convention (Schengen III) now apply throughout the EU.

Europol
As of 1 January 2010, the current Europol agreement137 will be replaced by the decision of the 
European	Council	establishing	the	European	Police	Office	(Europol).138

Eurojust
In December 2008 the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted a decision on 
the	strengthening	of	Eurojust	with	a	view	to	strengthening	the	fight	against	serious	crime.139 
This	decision	also	relates	to	the	prevention	of	human	trafficking	since	Eurojust	endeavours	
to assist national governments in this type of case.
The	main	priority	with	respect	to	human	trafficking	lies	in	improving	the	exchange	of	in-
formation. Member states should inform Eurojust of any cases (a) directly involving at least 
three member states, (b) in which requests for judicial cooperation have been transmitted to 
at least two member states and (c) when any of the following apply: there are factual indica-
tions that a criminal organisation is involved, the case has a serious cross-border dimension, 
or	the	case	involves	one	of	the	following	offences:	human	trafficking,	sexual	exploitation	of	
children and child pornography.
Expansion of Eurojust’s operational capacity, by establishing an on-call contact point for 
receiving requests for judicial cooperation, for example, is another important feature of the 
decision, which also expanded Eurojust’s power and tasks. For example, a country’s repre-
sentatives	at	Eurojust	can	ask	the	national	authorities	to	take	measures	justified	for	investiga-
tion or prosecution. The decision also refers to closer cooperation with national authorities 
and the European Judicial Network contact points. The decision provides for the establish-
ment	of	a	Eurojust	national	coordination	system	(ENCS)	and,	finally,	the	decision	envisages	

135 The treaty was concluded in May 2005 by the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, 
Germany	and	Austria.	The	Upper	House	of	Parliament	debated	the	Treaty	of	Prüm	on	intensification	of	
cross-border cooperation in tackling terrorism, crime and illegal immigration in Europe (Schengen III) on 
15 January 2008. The factions of GroenLinks and D66 maintained their objections, primarily concerning 
the protection of personal data, and noted their opposition to the act of approval of the Treaty of Prüm. The 
act of approval was adopted without a vote on 15 January 2008. By requesting a reservation, members could 
show that, if a vote had taken place on a bill, they would have voted against it. The act entered into force on 
30 January 2008. The Dutch parliamentary debate is in fact separate from the decision making at European 
level.

3.4.9 Stockholm programme

The current long-term programme for EU policy on justice and home affairs, The Hague 
programme, runs from 2005 to the end of 2009. This programme refers to ten priorities de-
signed to strengthen the scope of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, one 
of which is the development of a balanced migration policy. On the one hand, this encom-
passes	action	against	illegal	migration	and	human	trafficking,	and	on	the	other,	the	drafting	
of a plan on legal migration.NRM5 Work has already started on the drafting of the justice and 
home affairs policy for the period from 2010 to 2014. Given the intention to adopt this long-
term policy framework during Sweden’s presidency of the EU, it is also referred to as the 
‘Stockholm programme’.
During the preparation of the Stockholm programme, the Netherlands has raised a number 
of	points	that	it	regards	as	highly	relevant	for	tackling	human	trafficking	at	European	level.	
These points include the need to optimise the exchange of information for the purposes of 
fighting	crime,	 the	use	of	administrative	measures	against	organised	crime	 in	association	
with preventive measures and criminal sanctions – in the realisation that offences like hu-
man	trafficking	cannot	be	tackled	through	criminal	law	–	and	the	operational	implementa-
tion of both EU and regional priorities.140

The Swedish EU presidency has announced that it wants to give priority to the external di-
mension of EU cooperation in justice and home affairs issues.141

The EU’s ambition is to launch an Action-Oriented Programme for the external dimension 
of	human	trafficking	before	the	end	of	2009.	The	Netherlands	wants	at	least	to	create	more	
coherency and coordination in the EU’s external policy, per se.
Combating	human	trafficking	remains	a	priority	in	the	EU.	The	EC Group of Experts cor-
rectly	feels	that	this	priority	should	apply	not	only	in	the	field	of	justice	and	home	affairs,	
but also in the agendas of the ministries of social affairs and employment, foreign policy and 
development cooperation, equal opportunities and gender and public health.142

3.5 Council of Europe

3.5.1 Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (Warsaw 
Convention, 2005)

The	Council	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	is	the	
result of the negotiations of the Comité Ad Hoc sur la luttte contre la Traite des Êtres Humains 
(CAHTEH). The treaty was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 3 May 2005 and 
opened for signature on 16 May 2005.143 It entered into force on 1 February 2008 after it had 
been	ratified	by	the	requisite	ten	states,	including	at	least	eight	member	states	of	the	Council	
of	Europe.	The	convention	has	now	been	ratified	by	26	states.144

The	definition	and	punishment	of	human	trafficking	in	the	convention	are	based	on	the	UN	
Protocol	on	human	trafficking	and	 the	EU	Framework	Decision.	Since	 the	convention	uses	
the	 same	definition	of	 human	 trafficking	 as	 the	UN	Protocol,	 after	 ratification	 the	 conven-
tion is also relevant on this point for the interpretation of the sanctions in article 273f of the 
Netherlands Criminal Code, implementing the Protocol and Framework Decision. Like the 
UN	Protocol,	the	Council	of	Europe’s	convention	also	relates	to	human	trafficking	aimed	at	
the	removal	of	organs.	The	convention	applies	to	all	forms	of	human	trafficking,	national	and	
transnational, and whether or not it is connected with organised crime (article 2).
The	treaty	has	three	objectives:	(1)	to	prevent	and	combat	human	trafficking,	while	guarantee-
ing gender equality, (2) to protect the human rights of victims and to ensure effective investiga-
tion and prosecution, and (3) to promote international cooperation on action against human 
traffickingNRM5. The human-rights approach is an important perspective of the convention. 
According	to	the	preamble,	trafficking	in	human	beings	is	a	violation	of	human	rights	and	an	
offence to the dignity and the integrity of the human being.

The	Netherlands	signed	the	treaty	on	17	November	2005,	but	has	not	yet	ratified	it.145 The 
bill	for	the	Approval	of	the	Council	of	Europe	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	
Human Beings adopted in Warsaw on 16 May 2005 was published in April 2008 and passed 
by the Lower House of Parliament in November 2008. It had already been established that 
the convention would not require the amendment of any legislation since the Netherlands 
already complies with the obligations in the treaty.
However,	given	the	nature	of	the	crime	of	human	trafficking,	the	government	later	proposed	
adopting the maximum scope of protection afforded by the convention. Article 31 of the con-
vention	regulates	the	question	of	jurisdiction	over	human	trafficking.	By	virtue	of	article	45	

143 Bulletin of Treaties 2006, 99.

Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Georgia, Latvia, Luxem-
bourg, Malta, Moldavia, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Mac-
edonia, the United Kingdom and Slovenia. 16 countries have signed the Treaty (but are not yet parties to 
it): Andorra, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands San

of the convention, the Netherlands can make a reservation to this provision, but it will not 
do	so	in	view	of	the	nature	and	seriousness	of	the	offence	of	human	trafficking.146 For this 
reason, it was proposed that, in accordance with the convention,147 the jurisdiction over the 
offences	defined	 in	 the	convention	would	be	expanded	on	three	points	 (see	Chapter	2).148 
This proposed legal amendment regarding the expansion of jurisdiction meant that tacit 
(and	earlier)	ratification	was	no	longer	possible.

3.5.2 GRETA (Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings)

The	Convention	on	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	has	a	dual	supervision	mechanism	con-
sisting of a group of independent experts, the so-called Group of Experts on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) and the Committee of the Parties (the Committee). 
GRETA is a unique instrument in terms of international documents relating to human traf-
fickingNRM5. The intention is that GRETA, on the basis of information that member states 
are obliged to provide under the convention, will analyse the implementation of the treaty 
by the member states and make recommendations on how to address any shortcomings it 
identifies.	The	reports	it	produces	after	giving	a	right	of	reply	are	made	public.
On the basis of GRETA’s reports and conclusions, the Committee can then make recom-
mendations to a state. The treaty does not lay down a procedure for compelling enforcement 
of the recommendations. The Committee of the Parties consists of representatives of the 
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe from the states that are party to the treaty 
and representatives of states that are party to the treaty but not members of the Council 
of Europe.149 It is therefore an intergovernmental political body. Meetings of the Commit-
tee can be requested by one-third of the parties, by the Secretary General of the Council of 
Europe	or	by	the	President	of	GRETA.	The	Committee	met	for	the	first	time	in	December	

146 Parliamentary Documents II	2007/08,	31	429	(RI855),	no.	3,	p.	15:	‘Human	trafficking	is	a	very	serious	crime,	
which is often committed in the context of organised and transnational crime. It deeply affects the lives of 
its	victims.	Human	trafficking	seriously	shocks	our	legal	system	and	there	is	a	great	deal	of	consensus	in	the	
international community about the need to criminalise and effective prosecute it.’

147 Article 31, paragraph 1 under a to c require the establishment of jurisdiction when the offence occurs on a 
country’s own territory or onboard a country’s own ship or aircraft (articles 2 and 3 of the Dutch Criminal 
Code). Article 31, section 1 under d requires the establishment of jurisdiction for offences committed outside 
the country itself by a subject or a stateless person who is permanently resident in that country, if the offence 
is a punishable offence under the law of the place where the offence or the offences were committed or the 
offence is committed outside the jurisdiction of any state. Article 31, section 1 under e requires the establish-
ment of jurisdiction for offences committed against a country’s own nationals.

2008, within one year of the entry into force of the treaty, when one of its tasks was to elect 
the members of GRETA.150

The text of the convention does not allow nationals of states that are not party to the treaty 
to be members of GRETA;151 however, GRETA’s members are appointed as independent 
experts.152

GRETA currently has thirteen members who have been appointed for a period of four years.153 
The members of the group were appointed to create a balance in terms of gender, geographic 
distribution and multidisciplinary expertise.154 The group’s members also represent the most 
important legal systems and no two members are nationals of the same state.155

GRETA	met	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in	 Strasbourg	 in	 February	 2009.156 The intention is that 
GRETA will submit an annual report on its activities to the Committee of the Parties and 
the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. These annual reports will be pub-
lished.157

Meanwhile,	the	Trafficking	Information	Management	System	(TIMS)	has	also	been	estab-
lished to provide technical support for GRETA, to ensure that information from govern-
ments,	NGOs	and	others	is	collected	efficiently,	for	example,	and	that	the	information	can	
be analysed and reported on.158

150 The election of the members of GRETA was based on Resolution CM/Res(2008)7 on rules on the election pro-
cedure of the member of the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA). During 
the	first	meeting	of	the	Committee	in	December	2008,	the	Rules of procedure of the Committee of the Parties 
were adopted, THB-CP(2008)2, 5 December 2008.

151 Article 36, paragraph 2: ‘GRETA shall be composed up of a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 members, 
taking into account a gender and geographic balance, as well as a multidisciplinary expertise. They shall be 
elected,	for	a	term	of	office	of	4	years,	renewable	once,	by	the	Committee	of	the	Parties	from	amongst	na-
tionals of the States Parties to this Treaty.’

3.5.3 Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation 
and sexual abuse (Lanzarote Convention, 2007)

The Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse 
was adopted in Lanzarote and opened for signature on 25 October 2007.159 The Netherlands 
signed the convention at that time. The proposal for a law approving this convention was 
submitted to parliament on 9 December 2008.160 The treaty will enter into force as soon 
as	it	 is	ratified	by	five	states,	 including	at	 least	three	member	states	of	the	Council	of	Eu-
rope.161	The	convention	has	been	signed	by	36	states	and	ratified	by	Greece	and	Albania.162 
The	Netherlands	has	not	yet	ratified	the	treaty,	although	it	has	already	announced	that	it	will	
not	avail	itself	of	reservations	that	can	be	made	at	the	time	of	ratification.163

Content of the convention
The convention has three objectives: (1) to prevent and combat sexual exploitation and abuse 
of children, (2) to protect the rights of child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, and (3) 
to promote national and international cooperation against the sexual exploitation and abuse 
of	children.	Like	the	Council	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Hu-
man Beings, the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and 
Sexual Abuse is comprehensive and multidisciplinary, relating to the protection of children 
in the widest sense. Apart from provisions on punishment and sanctions, the treaty includes 
preventive and protective measures, procedural rules, interventions and measures relating 
to national coordination and international cooperation.
The	treaty	defines	a	‘child’	as	any	person	under	the	age	of	18,	which	is	the	conventional	in-
ternational	definition.	‘Victim’	is	used	in	the	treaty	to	cover	any	child	that	is	subject	to	sexual	
exploitation or sexual abuse.

Relevant international instruments
The	Lanzarote	Convention	is	based	in	part	on	existing	agreements	in	this	field.	The	Explan-
atory Report164 explicitly refers in this context to the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (1989)165 and the Optional Protocol to that convention (2000) on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography166,	the	UN	Protocol	on	human	trafficking	(2000),167

and the ILO Convention on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour (1999).168 A 
number of EU framework decisions are relevant, such as the Framework Decision on com-
bating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2003),169 the Framework 
Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings (2001)170 and the Framework 
Decision	on	combating	trafficking	in	human	beings	(2002).171 Finally, earlier conventions of 
the Council of Europe are also relevant because they provide binding instruments in related 
areas. These are the Convention on Cybercrime 2001172 and the Convention on Action against 
Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005).173

In a number of respects the Lanzarote Convention goes further than these instruments, by 
including a number of new criminal provisions, more extensive provisions on jurisdiction to 
combat child sex tourism and provisions relating to intervention programmes and measures 
targeted at perpetrators.174 Whereas other international instruments concentrate mainly on 
sexual exploitation of children – with the emphasis, according to the Explanatory Report , 
on	a	commercial	component	(child	prostitution,	child	pornography	and	child	trafficking)	–	
the Lanzarote Convention encompasses sexual abuse, per se, in addition to exploitation.
In the explanatory memorandum to the bill approving the convention, the government stat-
ed that sexual exploitation and sexual abuse are serious forms of child abuse. The protection 
of children against them is an integral part of the general approach to preventing child abuse. 
For the full range of facilities and measures that are being undertaken in the Netherlands in 
this area, see the Action Plan against Child Abuse.175

Reporting suspicions of sexual exploitation or sexual abuse
Article 12 of the Convention provides that states must take legislative or other measures to 
ensure	that	rules	of	professional	confidentiality	do	not	constitute	an	obstacle	to	the	possibil-
ity of certain professionals, who work in contact with children, reporting to the authorities 
responsible for protecting children any situation in which they have reasonable grounds for 
assuming that a child is the victim of sexual exploitation or sexual abuse. The explanatory 
memorandum states that there are no legal restrictions in the Netherlands to prevent a per-
son,	even	a	person	who	falls	under	a	code	of	professional	confidentiality,	from	reporting	a	
reasonable suspicion of sexual exploitation or sexual abuse.

Criminalisation
Article 18 of the Convention requires that sexual abuse of children must be made a criminal 
offence.	It	the	first	place,	engaging	in	sexual	activities	with	a	child	who	has	not	reached	the	age	
of sexual consent is made a criminal offence. These are children that, according to national 
law, have not yet reached the legal age for sexual activities. In Dutch law a children reaches the 
age of sexual consent at 16.176 Article 18, section 3 of the Convention in fact provides that this 
criminalisation is not intended to apply to voluntary sexual acts between minors. Secondly, on 
the grounds of this provision engaging in sexual activities with a child (any person under the 
age of 18) is a criminal offence if it is accompanied by the use of coercion, violence or threats, 
involves abuse of trust or dominance or abuse of the exceptionally vulnerable position of the 
child or a situation of dependency. 177

Article 19 of the Convention requires states to criminalise certain intentional conduct relating 
to child prostitution, such as recruiting a child for prostitution, coercing a child into prostitu-
tion	or	profiting	 from	or	otherwise	exploiting	a	 child	 for	 such	purposes.	These	actions	are	
made criminal offences in article 273f, section 1, under 3, 5, 6 and 8 of the Dutch Criminal 
Code. Article 19 also requires states to make it a criminal offence to have recourse to child 
prostitution, which the Explanatory Report to the Convention178	defines	as	‘making	use	of	the	
services of a child prostitute’. This action is made a criminal offence in the Netherlands in arti-
cles	247	and	248b	of	the	Dutch	Criminal	Code.	The	convention	defines	‘child	prostitution’	as	
the fact of using a child for sexual activities where money or any other form of remuneration or 
consideration is given or promised as payment, regardless of whether this promise, payment or 
consideration is made to the child or a third person.179 Payment, promise or compensation can 
also cover supplying narcotics or providing food or shelter.180

Article 20 of the Convention contains obligations on states to criminalise a number of inten-
tional	actions	relating	to	child	pornography.	Some	of	these	acts	are	defined	in	more	or	less	the	
same terms as in other international instruments, such as the production, offering, distribu-
tion, procurement and possession of child pornography. Article 240b of the Dutch Criminal 
Code makes these actions criminal offences. However, Article 20, section 1 under f of the Con-
vention contains a new provision requiring states to make knowingly obtaining access to child 
pornography through information and communication technologies a criminal offence.181

Article 21 of the Convention obliges states to make intentional conduct relating to the perform-
ance of children in pornographic performances a criminal offence. This refers to recruiting or 
coercing	a	child	to	participate	in	such	performances,	profiting	or	otherwise	deriving	benefit	
from it, otherwise exploiting a child for such purposes and knowingly attending pornographic 
performances in which children participate. These actions are made criminal offences in arti-
cles 248c and 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code.
Article 22 of the Convention provides that states must criminalise the intentional causing of 
a child to witness sexual abuse or sexual activities for sexual purposes (the corruption of chil-
dren). It is not required that the child has participated in the sexual activities. This is a new 
criminal offence compared with existing international instruments. The aim of this provision 
is	to	protect	children	against	harmful	influences	on	their	personal	and	sexual	development	and	

176 Because the statutory age of sexual majority varies greatly in the various members states of the Council of 
Europe (from 13 to 17 years), the Convention gives the member states freedom to determine this age them-
selves, Parliamentary Documents II 2008/09, 31 808 (R1872), no. 3, p. 10.

relates in particular to conduct that is intended to make a child susceptible to sexual exploita-
tion or sexual abuse. This will require additional legislation in the Netherlands.
Article	23	of	the	Convention,	finally,	requires	states	to	criminalise	‘grooming’,	the	act	of	inten-
tionally	approaching	children	for	sexual	purposes.	The	Convention	defines	it	as	the	intentional	
proposal by an adult, on Internet sites or chatrooms, to meet a child beneath the age of sexual 
consent with the ultimate aim of sexually abusing that child. The perpetrator’s conduct must 
specifically	involve	a	proposal	for	a	meeting	with	the	child	followed	by	a	specific	act	designed	to	
bring about that meeting, according to the Explanatory Report. The simple fact that an adult 
approaches and communicates with a child on the internet, regardless of the intent and the 
content of the communication, falls outside the scope of the offence. In some cases, but not all, 
persons can be prosecuted in the Netherlands for grooming on the basis of article 248a of the 
Dutch Criminal Code.
A number of the obligations to criminalise conduct included in this convention will therefore 
require the Netherlands to amend its legislation on these points. The amendment are included 
in a bill to implement the Lanzarote Convention that was sent to the Lower House of Parlia-
ment in December 2008 (see Chapter 2). 182

Aggravating circumstances
The Convention does not require judges to apply these aggravating circumstances, but on 
the grounds of article 28 of the Convention, in determining the sentence, judges must be 
allowed by national legislation to take a number of aggravating circumstances into account. 
The aggravating circumstances set out in the Convention are that the offence seriously dam-
aged the physical and mental health of the victim, the offence was preceded by or accompa-
nied by acts of torture or serious violence or the offence was committed against a particu-
larly vulnerable victim.183 The provision also covers the fact that the offence was committed 
by a family member, a person cohabiting with the child or a person who has abused his or her 
authority. The fact that the offence was committed by several people acting together or in 
the framework of a criminal organisation and where the perpetrator has committed similar 
offences in the past are other aggravating circumstances that a national judge should be able 
to take into account.
An important provision is that in determining the sanction, states must also make it possible 
to	 take	 into	account	final	 sentences	 that	have	been	 imposed	 in	another	member	 state	 for	
similar offences.184

183 Examples of vulnerability are given in the Explanatory Report, such as children who are physically, men-

tally or socially handicapped, children without parental care (street children or single underage aliens), very 
young	children	or	children	under	the	influence	of	drugs	or	alcohol.

from criminal records, 22 December 2005, COM(2005)690. This Framework Decision obliges the member 
states	to	ensure	that	a	final	sentencing	rendered	in	another	member	state	can	have	consequences	that	are	
equivalent to the consequences that can be attached to an earlier conviction in the country itself. The Frame-
work Decision was adopted on 26 February 2009 during the meeting of the Council of Ministers of Justice 
and Home Affairs

Jurisdiction
The Convention requires states to establish jurisdiction for offences that are committed in 
their own territory or on board a ship or aircraft of that country or when the offence is com-
mitted by one of its nationals or residents.185 The Netherlands complies with these provisions 
on jurisdiction, which, according to the Explanatory Report, are mainly intended to combat 
sex tourism.186 Article 25, section 2 of the Convention says that states should endeavour to 
establish jurisdiction over offences committed abroad against their own nationals and resi-
dents. The explanatory memorandum states that the Netherlands has no general rule for ex-
traterritorial jurisdiction over offences committed against Dutch victims.187 In view of its na-
ture and seriousness, the government has submitted a bill to expand the existing Dutch rules 
of jurisdiction with respect to this offence, for example with respect to Dutch victims.188

Monitoring mechanism
The Convention creates a mechanism for monitoring the effective implementation of its pro-
visions in the form of a Committee of Parties.189 The committee has less extensive powers to 
monitor compliance than those laid down in the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action 
against	Trafficking	 in	Human	Beings	(2005),	since	 that	convention	has	a	dual	monitoring	
mechanism, including GRETA, which is made up of independent experts (see § 3.5.2).

3.5.4 Resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly

In 2007, the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly adopted a resolution on prostitu-
tion190	in	which	it	condemned	coerced	prostitution	and	human	trafficking	as	modern	slavery	
and as one of the most serious violations of human rights in contemporary Europe. Member 
states of the Council of Europe were called on to ratify the Convention on Action against 
Trafficking	in	Human	Beings.	The	Assembly	also	recommended	that	the	European	Com-
munity should accede to the Convention as soon as possible and that GRETA should be 
provided	with	all	the	necessary	resources	to	allow	it	to	operate	independently	and	efficiently	
as soon as the Convention enters into force.
The Assembly recommended that every member state should prohibit prostitution by peo-
ple under the age of 18 since prostitution by minors cannot be regarded as voluntary (the 
consent of a minor is after all irrelevant). It said the approach to the problem should cor-
respond with the approach in the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Traf-
ficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005)	that	all	minors	should	be	regarded	as	victims	and	must	be	
protected accordingly; they should not be prosecuted. There should be an active policy to 
prosecute clients of underage prostitutes.

The resolution is mainly concerned with the policy towards voluntary prostitution by adults. 
The Assembly observed that this policy varies greatly in the 47 member states. According 
to the Assembly, roughly one-third of the countries pursue a policy that bans prostitution 
and criminalises both prostitutes and pimps (not necessarily clients) – the prohibitionist ap-
proach. A minority of countries (nine, according to the PA) pursue a policy of regulating 
prostitution. Twenty of the countries pursue a policy that could be described as abolitionist, 
meaning that their aim is to abolish prostitution by punishing pimps. Sweden, which has 
gone a step further by also criminalising clients of prostitutes, was explicitly mentioned in 
this context.191 The Assembly argued that the problem is that in many countries, particularly 
where prostitution is banned but also to some extent in abolitionist countries, prostitution 
is forced underground. Consequently, organised crime is more likely than not to be involved 
and prostitutes are more vulnerable.

The Parliamentary Assembly points out that international organisations, such as the WHO, 
have abandoned moralistic approaches and opted instead for a more pragmatic attitude. The 
Assembly does not recommend a particular policy but does feel that an explicit policy should 
be formulated, one that avoids double standards192 and prevents prostitutes going under-
ground	or	falling	under	the	influence	of	pimps.	Countries	should	instead	strengthen	the	posi-
tion of prostitutes, particularly by not criminalising and punishing them and by developing 
programmes that (1) help them leave the profession if they want to, address, (2) address the 
personal weaknesses of prostitutes (for example, mental problems, child abuse, drug abuse), 
and (3) address structural problems (poverty, political instability or war, gender inequality, 
lack of education). If necessary, this should also be done in countries of origin to prevent peo-
ple being forced into prostitution due to their circumstances. The policy should ensure that 
prostitutes	have	access	to	safe	sex	and	sufficient	independence	to	insist	on	this	with	clients	
and should strengthen the position of prostitutes by respecting their right, if they voluntarily 
choose to work as prostitutes, to have a say in policies relevant to them at national, regional 
and local level.

In its reaction, the Committee of Ministers endorsed the view that the EU should ratify the 
Convention	on	Action	 against	Trafficking	 in	Human	Beings	 (2005)	 and	 that	prostitution	
by minors can never be voluntary, referring in that context to the Convention of Lanzarote 
(2007).193 As regards voluntary prostitution involving adults, like the Assembly the Commit-
tee observed that policies on prostitution vary greatly in the 47 member states of the Coun-
cil	of	Europe	and	that	formulating	a	common	policy	on	this	subject	will	be	difficult	at	the	
present time. In light of the major human rights implications of prostitution, the Committee 
instructed the European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) to carry out a study into the 

191 Also in Norway as of 1 January 2009.
192 Resolution 1579 (4 October 2007), para. 8: ‘The prohibitionist and abolitionist approaches furthermore have the 

disadvantage of enshrining a certain double standard. In many countries applying these approaches, for example, 
paid sex itself is not prohibited, but offering paid sex is. The height of the hypocrisy is that even where prostitutes 
are sanctioned, clients are not.’

feasibility of formulating a common policy on prostitution. At the time of writing, it was not 
yet	known	when	the	findings	of	that	study	could	be	expected.

3.5.5 Commissioner for Human Rights

In	addition	to	human	rights	in	general	and	other	specific	issues,	the	Commissioner for Human 
Rights	continues	to	systematically	raise	the	question	of	human	trafficking	during	his	visits	to	
member states of the Council of Europe and his reports on them. The purpose of the visits is to 
assess the human rights situation in the country concerned in relation to international stand-
ards.	In	his	reports,	the	Commissioner	stresses	that	human	trafficking	is	a	serious	and	complex	
human rights problem with a distinct international dimension. He devotes particular attention 
to criminal law, effective implementation of national action plans (where they exist), the facili-
ties for victims and the protection of victims, with special attention to children.

The Commissioner for Human Rights visited the Netherlands in 2008. His report on (the pro-
tection of) human rights in the Netherlands following this visit contained a number of recom-
mendations	for	measures	against	human	trafficking.194	The	Commissioner	first	recommended	
ratifying	the	Convention	on	action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	and	defining	the	term	
‘labour exploitation’ more precisely in article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code. The govern-
ment’s view on the latter recommendation is that the interpretation and scope of article 273f of 
the Dutch Criminal Code on ‘other forms of exploitation’ will develop in legal practice and that 
it is inappropriate to propose separate legislation on labour exploitation at the present time.195

Secondly, the Commissioner recommended improvements in measures to identify victims 
quickly	to	avoid	victims	of	human	trafficking	being	detained	 in	aliens	detention.	Young	vic-
tims	should	also	be	given	the	benefit	of	the	doubt	when	it	is	difficult	to	establish	whether	they	
are minors or not. The government said in its reaction that the Netherlands already follows 
the recommended procedure where it cannot be established with certainty that a person is a 
minor, since persons falling into this category are offered the B9 procedure, which makes no 
distinction by age. With respect to detaining victims in aliens detention, the government said 
this must be avoided where possible. It pointed out that when indications are missed or aliens 
only say that they are victims after being detained, they can still be interviewed while in cus-
tody. ‘If the police and the public prosecution service conclude that the person is a victim and 
the	victim	avails	of	the	reflection	period	or	makes	a	complaint	to	the	police,	the	grounds	for	
detention lapse and it is lifted’.
A third recommendation concerned the provision of shelter for victims. According to the 
Commissioner, the capacity in terms of specialist shelter must be increased. Municipalities 
should	also	be	given	adequate	support	in	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking.

3.5.6 Campaigns and other activities

The meeting of heads of state and government leaders of the member states of the Council 
of	Europe	in	2005,	at	which	adopted	the	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Hu-
man Beings was adopted, also agreed to the Action PlanNRM5.196 As part of the Action Plan, in 
2006 the Council of Europe started the two-year Campaign to combat trafficking in human 
beings NRM5.197	The	campaign	has	two	objectives:	the	first	is	to	increase	the	awareness	among	
governments,	NGOs	and	the	public	of	the	scale	of	human	trafficking	in	Europe;	the	second	is	
to encourage as many states as possible to sign and ratify the Convention on Action against 
Trafficking	in	Human	Beings.	To	this	end,	the	Council	of	Europe	organised	regional	semi-
nars that were attended by 41 member states.198 One element of the publicity campaign for 
the general public was a strip cartoon for young people entitled You’re not for sale, which ap-
peared in 16 languages. Other important steps taken by the Council of Europe were a study 
into the abuse of the internet to recruit victims199 and the publication of a Handbook for par-
liamentarians on the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Be-
ings. Under the slogan Human being – not for sale, this campaign ran until the Convention 
entered into force in February 2008.

and national reporting mechanisms.202 The Special Representative circulated a question-
naire receiving 40 responses from OSCE member states and four from partner countries203 
of the OSCE.204 The results were presented in the annual report for 2008205 and formed the 
basis for a number of recommendations for increasing the capacity of national coordination 
mechanisms and improving national action plans and national rapporteurs or equivalent 
agencies. For example, the Special Representative said that states should continue to en-
courage and facilitate the participation of and input from NGOs and other members of civil 
society in the work of the national coordination mechanisms and national rapporteurs or 
equivalent mechanisms and the formulation of national action plans. National action plans 
should also promote coordination and/or cooperation at every level of government. National 
rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms should share best practices and compare and study 
findings	to	generate	 insights	 that	could	promote	transnational	cooperation	and	coordina-
tion. In this context, it was also recommended that participating states should provide rel-
evant	documents	concerning	action	against	human	trafficking	for	the	ODIHR	website.206

One general recommendation was that participating states should ensure that their coordinat-
ing	mechanisms	and	national	rapporteurs	or	equivalent	mechanisms	are	adequately	financed	
and	staffed.	The	activities	of	these	bodies	should	encompass	all	forms	of	human	trafficking,	
not	only	exploitation	in	the	sex	industry	but	also	in	other	sectors	and	human	trafficking	with	a	
view to organ removal. Reports by national rapporteurs should be used to regularly review and 
amend measures in national action plans and to adopt and improve measures.

National coordination mechanisms
The response to the questionnaire showed variation in the structures of national coordination 
mechanisms. At least 58% of the member states and partner countries have such a mechanism. 
These agencies are usually managed by ministries from a perspective of (criminal) law enforce-
ment or immigration: a Ministry of Justice or a Ministry of Home Affairs. Only a few countries 
directed	the	coordination	of	the	approach	to	human	trafficking	primarily	from	the	perspective	
of the victims. According to many states (66.7%), a lack of funds affected the work of national 
coordination mechanisms. Many mechanisms have little or no funding to support their efforts 
to	prevent	human	trafficking.

202 The priorities set by the Special Representative for 2007 were 1. to encourage action at the national level and 
the	establishment	of	national	structures	to	combat	human	trafficking;	2.	to	promote	evidence-based	policy	
and	programs;	3.	to	increase	efforts	to	prevent	human	trafficking;	4.	to	give	priority	to	actions	against	child	
trafficking;	5.	 to	address	all	 forms	of	human	trafficking;	and	6.	 to	promote	effective	help	 for	victims	and

Of the states that have a national coordination mechanism, 48.7% said that they have a na-
tional working group, committee or task force, and 46.2% also have a national coordinator. 
More than half (61.5%) of the respondents said that civil society plays a role in national coor-
dination. This sometimes takes the form of membership of the coordination mechanism and, 
sometimes, formal consultation. This corresponds with earlier recommendations, for example 
by the OSCE, to establish a National Referral Mechanism. The report says that a recent trend 
has been to formalise these working relations between authorities and social workers, although 
this subject was not included in the questionnaire. Less than a third of the states (30.8%) said 
that civil society is not involved in the relevant mechanism, although coordination mechanisms 
in some countries use other methods to secure input from and the participation of NGOs.

National action plans
National	action	plans	are	used	to	plan	(policy)	actions	against	human	trafficking	in	a	systemat-
ic, organised and coordinated manner. Most states (53.7%) said that they have an action plan or 
similar coordinated policy, while more than 10% of the respondents said they did not, including 
several	that	are	very	active	in	fighting	human	trafficking.	Almost	all	of	the	states	with	a	formal	
action plan said that their national policy plan encompasses the following themes: legislation, 
prevention, protection of and help for victims, investigation and prosecution, international co-
operation and the role and responsibilities of various relevant agencies. Most national action 
plans contain timetables for monitoring progress in implementing the planned measures.

National rapporteurs or similar mechanisms
According to the OSCE annual report 2008, national rapporteurs or similar mechanisms 
should help states to collected quantitative and qualitative data, analyse this information and 
report	on	it	to	improve	measures	against	human	trafficking.	A	total	of	26	(38.8%)	of	the	mem-
ber states and partner countries said that they have a national rapporteur or similar mecha-
nism, while 23.9% of the states reported they did not.

In response to this report the EU said that it shared the Special Representative’s concerns 
about	all	forms	of	human	trafficking,	particularly	in	view	of	the	limited	extent	to	which	vic-
tims	are	identified	and	the	small	number	of	human	traffickers	that	are	convicted.	The	EU	
is convinced that it would be useful for every state to have a dedicated coordination and re-
porting mechanism and endorsed the recommendations in the OSCE report.207 The Czech 
Republic,	as	president	of	the	EU	in	the	first	half	of	2009,	then	organised	a	conference	on	this	
subject.208 On the basis of another questionnaire, the Czech presidency developed a web-
site	with	information	about	national	rapporteurs	on	human	trafficking	in	the	EU	member	
states.209

3.6.2 Decisions of the Permanent Council

In	one	of	its	Decisions	in	2007,	the	OSCE’s	Permanent	Council	urged	ratification	of	the	UN	
Convention against organised crime and called on states to share information about imple-
mentation of this convention and to facilitate communication on it with the UNODC.212 The 
Permanent Council also called on states to establish effective central authorities to receive, 
implement and pass on requests for legal assistance in accordance with the UN convention, 
to participate actively in UNODC technical working groups on mutual legal assistance and, 
where possible, to cooperate. In 2008, the Permanent Council decided that one of the topics 
to be addressed at the 2008 Human Dimension Implementation Meeting should be the focus 
on	the	identification	of,	help	for	and	access	to	the	courts	for	victims	of	human	trafficking.213

3.6.3 Decisions of the Ministerial Council

The annual Ministerial Council of the OSCE published a Decision on Combating Labour 
Trafficking in 2007.214 This document contains recommendations to the member states relat-
ing	to	human	trafficking	in	sectors	other	than	the	sex	industry.	The	recommendations	cover	
subjects	such	as	access	to	courts	and	the	identification	of	and	help	for	victims.	The	Council	
also called on member states to establish effective and proportionate sanctions for anyone 
who	facilitates	human	trafficking,	including	employers	who	exploit	workers,	and	to	consider	
holding contractors criminally responsible if they consciously make use of subcontractors 
that	are	involved	in	human	trafficking.	States	are	also	called	on	to	create	the	possibility	for	
victims not to be punished for involvement in illegal activities in so far as they are forced to 
perform them (non-punishment clause). The Decision also suggests expanding or strength-
ening	legislation	to	offer	victims	of	human	trafficking	the	possibility	of	securing	compensa-
tion, including back payment of wages, where appropriate.

One of the decisions made at the OSCE Ministerial Council215 in 2008 was to intensify ac-
tion	against	human	trafficking.	For	example,	it	published	the	Decision on Enhancing Criminal 
Justice Responses to Trafficking in Human Beings through a Comprehensive Approach.216 This 
document appeared after the OSCE conference Successful Prosecution of Human Trafficking: 
Challenges and Good Practices.217

This Decision encourages states, in so far as they do not already do so, to criminalise human 
trafficking	in	their	national	legislation	and	to	ensure	that	criminals	do	not	avoid	punishment.	
Training	on	human	trafficking	should	be	included	in	the	curricula	for	police	and	the	relevant	
authorities in national prosecution agencies and the judiciary should receive specialist train-
ing. States should also take account of policy and consequences in relation to human traf-
ficking	in	the	instructions	issued	to	military	personnel	and	citizens	that	are	being	deployed	
abroad. States are also urged to promote cooperation between law enforcement agencies, 
the judiciary (where appropriate), other agencies (including social services) and relevant civ-
il-society	organisations	(where	appropriate)	to	improve	the	identification	of	victims.	States	
should also consider establishing partnerships between law enforcement agencies and civil-
society organisations, partly with a view to providing help to victims.
States are also called on to (1) recognise the need for victims to have adequate time to recover 
from trauma and (2) to take measures to enable victims to receive a fair and suitable compen-
sation for damage they sustain and to be allowed to submit these claims during criminal or 
civil proceedings. The document refers to the importance of cooperation between national 
authorities and international bodies, such as Europol and Interpol and urges states to inten-
sify	measures	 to	disrupt	human	trafficking	networks,	using	 instruments	such	as	financial	
investigations,	investigations	into	money	laundering	connected	with	human	trafficking	and	
the	attachment	and	confiscation	of	the	property	of	human	traffickers.
Finally, the Special Representative is instructed to make recommendations, in its regular 
reports to the Permanent Council and in association with the member states, on ways of 
improving	the	response	of	criminal	law	to	human	trafficking.

3.6.4 Resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly

At its 14th annual meeting in 2006218 the Parliamentary Assembly adopted the Resolution on 
Combating Trafficking and the Exploitation of Children in Pornography.219 In this resolution, 
the Assembly condemns sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and calls on states 
to create a legal basis for combating the distribution of child pornography via the internet. 
States are also called on to provide regular information about the activities of national au-
thorities	to	combat	human	trafficking	and	exploitation	of	children	in	prostitution	and	por-

nography. The resolution encourages states to consider setting up telephone or internet hot-
lines where individuals can report situations involving child pornography anonymously so 
that such situations can be investigated by the prosecuting authorities. States are also en-
couraged to collect data about criminal investigations into child pornography.

In 2007 the Assembly adopted a resolution entitled Strengthening of Counteraction of Traf-
ficking in Persons in OSCE Participating States.220 The resolution expresses concern about the 
emergence of new methods of recruitment and exploitation of victims and describes human 
trafficking	as	an	international	crime	and	a	serious	violation	of	human	rights.
The	Assembly	called	on	states	to	intensify	their	efforts	to	prevent	human	trafficking,	includ-
ing	human	trafficking	within	national	borders.	National	governments	and	parliaments	are	
called on to give priority to signing and ratifying the Council of Europe’s Convention on 
Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005)	and	to	apply	the	provisions	in	it	relating	
to the protection of victims and to the strengthening of international cooperation and pre-
ventive measures. It says that victims should be protected regardless of their willingness to 
cooperate with the prosecuting authorities.
States are encouraged to introduce or to strengthen transparent, effective and independ-
ent	methods	to	monitor	activities	against	human	trafficking.	The	resolution	refers	to	civil	
society and NGOs as important partners, and states are called on to cooperate actively with 
NGOs. It says it is necessary to give victims access to the courts and to strengthen the effec-
tiveness of legal protection of victims; according to the resolution, victims should therefore 
receive unconditional and free legal assistance.
The resolution also calls on states not to limit efforts (such as criminalisation) to prevent 
human	trafficking	to	exploitation	in	the	sex	industry	and	to	focus	more	on	such	aspects	as	
widespread forced labour and services, including indentured labour and child labour. States 
should develop strategies to address the socio-economic causes of exploitation in other eco-
nomic	sectors	than	the	sex	industry.	Addressing	the	root	causes	of	human	trafficking,	such	
as poverty, gender inequality and discrimination, is seen as a fundamental component of the 
international	fight	against	human	trafficking.	Accordingly,	the	resolution	says	that	the	cor-
responding policy should include measures to address these causes. The resolution devotes 
special	attention	to	the	needs	of	child	victims	of	human	trafficking,	for	example	by	strongly	
recommending educational programmes targeted at particularly vulnerable groups of chil-
dren, including those in institutional care. It says that national hotlines should be set up to 
receive reports of missing children and children who are being exploited in sex tourism, hu-
man	trafficking,	pornography	and	prostitution.
Finally,	the	resolution	states	that	measures	against	human	trafficking	must	not	have	a	nega-
tive	effect	on	–	or	violate	–	the	human	rights	of	trafficked	persons	or	other	groups	and	must	
comply with the standards and principles of the international human rights system.

At its 17th annual meeting in 2008 the Assembly passed a resolution on Strengthening Efforts 
to Combat all Forms of Human Trafficking in Human Beings and Addressing the Special Needs 
of Child Victims (the Astana Declaration).221 This resolution explicitly expresses concern that 
corruption by government representatives continues to undermine efforts to combat human 
trafficking.

By	contrast	with	the	general	human	trafficking	resolution	adopted	by	the	Assembly	in	2007,	
this resolution also expresses concern that military and civil personnel serving in interna-
tional	peacekeeping	operations	or	other	missions,	 including	contractors	and	field	workers	
of	international	organisations,	may	contribute	to	the	demand	side	of	the	human	trafficking	
cycle. Reports of misconduct by military and civilian personnel during such missions have 
a	negative	 impact	on	the	ability	 to	fulfil	 the	mandates	of	 these	missions,	according	to	the	
resolution.
Other resolutions referred to in the Astana Declaration also	touched	on	human	trafficking:	
the resolution on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children222 and the resolution on Vio-
lence against Women.223

With	regard	 to	human	trafficking,	 the	Parliamentary	Assembly	said	 in	 the	Declaration	of	
Vilnius (2009) that economic dependency of women on men could make them victims of 
prostitution	and	human	trafficking.224 The OSCE also encouraged member states to tackle 
human	trafficking	with	preventive	programmes	and	by	raising	public	awareness.	Member	
states should also open a national telephone number for reports of exploitation of children, 
including	human	trafficking,	pornography,	prostitution	and	sex	tourism.	The	Declaration	
calls	on	member	states	to	actively	combat	human	trafficking	and	to	ratify	the	UN	Conven-
tions and Protocols, as well as the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Traf-
ficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005).

221 Astana, 29 June-3 July 2008.
222 For example, the PA expressed serious concerns about situations that had emerged in which children had 

been sexually abused or assaulted by members of peacekeeping forces, private security forces and humani-
tarian	organisations	in	a	number	of	areas	of	conflict.	The	resolution	also	refers	to	the	2006	Brussels	Resolu-
tion of the PA on Combating Trafficking and the Exploitation in Pornography, and to Decision No. 9/07 of the 
Ministerial Council on Combating Sexual Exploitation of Children on the Internet. In this resolution states 
were also called on to ratify the Convention of the Council of Europe on the Protection of Children against 
Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007).

223 In this resolution the OSCE PA remarks that ‘women’s economic dependency on men makes women easy 
targets	for	oppression	and	abuse,	as	well	as	potential	victims	of	prostitution	and	human	trafficking,	and	af-
firms	the	importance	of	reducing	poverty	and	of	actively	promoting	possibilities	for	women	in	the	labour	
market.’

3.7 Dutch foreign policy and human rights

In	November	2007,	the	Dutch	government	devoted	a	separate	section	to	human	trafficking	
in	its	human	rights	strategy	for	foreign	policy	for	the	first	time.	The	government	stated	that	
serious	offences	such	as	terrorism	and	human	trafficking	can	lead	to	serious	violations	of	
the fundamental rights of the victims, such as the right to life and the right to freedom, and 
that ‘… it is the task of the government to put an end to that, since it is the government’s 
duty to protect its citizens’.225 The government also stated that the Netherlands ‘will con-
tinue	to	press	actively	for	action	against	human	trafficking	at	national	and	international	lev-
els. The human rights aspects will be included in every phase of the effort to tackle human 
trafficking’,226 in other words in prevention, investigation and prosecution and – where ap-
plicable	–	repatriation	and	reintegration.	Human	rights	aspects	arise	more	specifically	with	
respect to the protection of victims, according to the accompanying action plan.227

The	 action	plan	 also	mentions	 specific	bilateral	 activities	 undertaken	by	 the	Netherlands	
with Romania, Bulgaria and Nigeria. In the NRM’s reports these countries have always been 
among	the	top	five	most	common	countries	of	origin	of	registered	victims	in	recent	years.228

The	first	report	on	the	implementation	of	the	human	rights	strategy	was	published	in	March	
2009.229	The	section	on	human	trafficking	contains	a	concise	overview	of	several	 interna-
tional developments and some current activities that were mentioned earlier. The section on 
the rights of children also devotes attention to the elimination of child labour, child prostitu-
tion, child pornography and child sex tourism.
In	the	human	rights	strategy	for	foreign	policy	the	subject	of	human	trafficking	still	seems	to	
be limited to exploitation in the sex industry or the exploitation of children. There is, in any 
case, no explicit mention of the exploitation of adults in other sectors.

3.8 Conclusions

This section outlines outstanding problems relating to the subjects discussed in this chapter, 
and topics that demand special attention.

ganisations. The activities of international governmental organisations – UN (and ILO), EU,

Council of Europe and OSCE – suggest that some subjects are receiving special attention. 
They include exploitation in sectors outside the sex industry, the root causes of human traf-
ficking	and	the	demand	side.	International	organisations	are	also	devoting	special	attention	
to vulnerable groups such as women and children. Instruments being developed to tackle 
(sexual) exploitation of children also encompass child pornography. There is also continued 
attention	to	combating	human	trafficking	connected	to	missions	by	military	personnel	and	
civilians	in	conflict	areas.
Various	international	organisations	–	the	EU	and	OSCE	in	particular	–	have	specifically	re-
ferred	to	the	importance	of	national	action	plans	against	human	trafficking.	There	are	grow-
ing calls for states to appoint a national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism to monitor 
measures that have been taken and to evaluate policy.
The process of developing a network of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms 
had already started during Sweden’s EU presidency, with meetings in Stockholm and Vi-
enna in 2009. It is not yet clear how the network will evolve in the future. A similar meeting 
has also been held in Brussels.

A	crucial	aspect	of	efforts	to	address	international	human	trafficking	is	the	collection	of	reli-
able data. Various initiatives have already been taken at international level, for example to 
formulate international standards for data collection. To this end, various indicators are be-
ing formulated on which national governments should supply information for the purposes 
of international comparison. There is not yet a single formal international standard. The 
standards that have been developed often also require the collection of a large volume of 
data,	much	of	 it	difficult	 to	collect.	The	 likely	consequence	of	this	 is	 that	 the	 information	
supplied is incomplete and of poor quality. It appears that while various international organi-
sations are currently developing systems of international data collection there is not enough 
cooperation and that, therefore, different standards are being developed.

On paper, there is now a very extensive range of international legal instruments. However, 
many	countries	are	still	not	party	to	treaties	such	as	the	UN	Protocol	against	trafficking	in	
persons and the underlying UN Convention against transnational organised crime, although 
these	instruments	provide	a	firm	basis	for	international	cooperation	in	criminal	law,	particu-
larly with countries outside the EU. This applies, for example, to countries like China and 
India, a number of whose nationals are registered as victims in the Netherlands.
The EU should also continue to highlight the importance of ratifying these instruments, for 
example in the context of the external dimension of the Justice and Home Affairs policy. A 
third of the UN member states are still not party to the UN Protocol.
Although	most	countries	have	criminalised	human	trafficking	in	the	sex	industry,	few	coun-
tries	in	the	world	have	done	so	with	respect	to	human	trafficking	in	other	sectors	(trafficking	
for	forced	labour,	for	example)	or	human	trafficking	where	men	are	the	victims.	In	so	far	as	
states	have	ratified	the	UN	Palermo	Protocol,	its	implementation	is	generally	lagging	due	to	
the lack of comprehensive national legislation, a lack of resources for enforcement and a lack 
of political will, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

The	Council	of	Europe’s	Convention	on	Action	against	Trafficking	in	Human	Beings	(2005)	
has	also	not	yet	been	widely	ratified,	not	even	by	the	Netherlands,	because	of	a	proposed	
amendment	to	the	law	intended	to	expand	jurisdiction	over	human	trafficking.
The	European	Commission’s	evaluation	of	the	EU	Action	Plan	on	human	trafficking	shows	
that	efforts	to	tackle	human	trafficking	must	remain	high	on	the	European	agenda.	A	positive	
aspect is that the Netherlands is pressing for this (see also recommendation 58 in NRM5), 
since the evaluation of the EU Action Plan showed that there is a wide gap between current 
legislation and its implementation in practice in Europe.

In March 2009, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a new Framework Deci-
sion	on	combating	trafficking	in	human	beings.	However,	the	discussion	and	implementa-
tion	of	the	proposed	new	Framework	Decision	should	not	be	at	the	expense	of	ratification	
of	 the	Council	 of	Europe’s	Convention	 on	Action	 against	Trafficking	 on	Human	Beings	
(2005). Provisions relating to help for and protection of victims in the proposal must not 
curtail what has already been reached in the Council of Europe’s Convention. The proposal 
for a new EU Framework Decision should also not weaken the willingness to implement the 
provisions of the Council of Europe’s Convention.

als, which entered into force on 20 July 2009, is also relevant to efforts to tackle human traf-
ficking.	This	directive	lays	down	a	number	of	minimum	standards	for	sanctions	and	meas-
ures against employers of third-country nationals living illegally in a state. These minimum 
standards will probably require amendment of Dutch legislation.
Today	it	is	clear,	internationally	and	nationally,	that	human	trafficking	has	to	be	regarded	as	
a violation of human rights. This is also apparent from the activities of various mechanisms 
established to monitor the enforcement of human rights, including UN agencies. It is an ad-
vance	that	combating	human	trafficking	is	now	an	explicit	element	of	Dutch	foreign	policy	
on human rights. The Dutch human rights strategy for foreign policy could, however, more 
clearly	state	that	human	trafficking	also	affects	adults	who	are	exploited	in	sectors	other	than	
the sex industry.
With	any	human	rights	approach	to	human	trafficking	–	including	one	pursued	by	the	Neth-
erlands – it is important to take a priori account of effects that measures against human traf-
ficking	could	have	on	those	same	human	rights	and	to	avoid	collateral	damage	as	far	as	pos-
sible. A vision should be formulated on how to achieve this. A relevant fact in this context is 
that a number of international mechanisms that supervise compliance with human rights, in 
the	Netherlands	as	well	as	in	other	countries,	argue	that	help	to	victims	of	human	trafficking	
should not depend on cooperation with the (criminal) investigation.

Victims and help for victims

4.1 Introduction

This chapter provides information about victims of human trafficking and the facilities avail-
able to provide shelter and care for them. The chapter opens with a description of a number 
of specific categories of victims (§4.2). Section 4.3 covers the registration of data about vic-
tims and presents statistics for 2007 and 2008, including comparisons with earlier years in 
some cases. The statistics include some background features of victims, such as country of 
origin, age and gender, residence status and the agency that reported the individuals as vic-
tims (provided by CoMensha1), as well as information from the Immigration and Naturali-
sation Service (IND) about applications for and the awarding of B9 status. Section 4.4 con-
tains information, provided by the Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) and the Violent 
Offences Compensation Fund (SGM), about compensation awarded to victims. Section 4.5 
examines the reporting of human trafficking by victims. First-line facilities for providing 
shelter for victims are discussed in §4.6, which first covers shelter for specific categories of 
victim, closed youth care and alternative shelter facilities. Incidental problems facing victims 
of human trafficking are discussed in §4.7. Basically, the information follows on from the 
details provided in earlier NRM reports. The chapter concludes with a review of some issues 
requiring attention and problems that need to be addressed (§4.8).

4.2	 Specific	categories	of	victims

This section describes a number of specific groups, namely women from the La Strada coun-
tries, men from Eastern Europe, victims of loverboys and other minors working in prostitu-
tion, young boys and Roma children. Other groups discussed are the children of victims and 
the previously mentioned risk groups of women and girls in asylum centres and persons with 
slight mental handicaps.

4.2.1  Women from the La Strada countries

The NRM’s first report analysed in detail the factors that make women vulnerable to exploi-
tation. Subsequent reports devoted attention to specific groups of women and girls, such as 
women in asylum centres and women whose residence status depends on others. This sec-
tion discusses the vulnerable position of many women in some Eastern European countries 

1 Until December 2007, CoMensha was known as the Foundation against Trafficking in Women (STV).

(the so-called La Strada countries2) on the basis of desk research3 carried out by La Strada 
International (LSI). Blokhuis4 concludes that although men and women have equal rights in 
the majority of the La Strada countries5, in practice, the rights of women are infringed. The 
political transformations and the transition from centrally planned economies to the free-
market economy that have taken place in many La Strada countries have been accompanied 
by an upsurge in patriarchal values and standards. Gender equality has come to be associ-
ated with the communist regime. Unemployment is greater among women than among men, 
women are paid less and they have been forced from the public into the private domain. This 
has consequences for their position in the home, in the labour market and in the migration 
process.
There is a lot of domestic violence and there seems to be a correlation between a person’s 
status as a victim of domestic violence and of human trafficking.6 The feminisation of pov-
erty leads to feminisation of migration, but the fact that possibilities for migrating legally are 
limited fosters the use of the services of smugglers and other intermediaries, which increases 
the risk of exploitation. The position of women from a social, civil and economic perspective 
is also worse than that of men in many other parts of the world. In that context, gender in-
equality is an important contributing factor to human trafficking. Economic empowerment 
could prove a powerful tool for preventing human trafficking.

4.2.2  Men

Surtees (2008) conducted research into the situation of men as victims of human traffick-
ing, which is very rarely highlighted. She analysed the data on 685 men from Belarus or the 
Ukraine who were registered in the IOM’s database as victims who had received counselling 
from the IOM or its partners in the period 2004-2006. She also interviewed victims and 
studied case files. Although none of the victims ended up in the Netherlands and none of 
the recruiters – as far as is known – were from the Netherlands, it is nevertheless interesting 
to report some of the findings from the study. Many of the victims migrated to provide for 
their children. More than half of the men had work qualifications (from trained labourer to 
a university education) and by no means all were unemployed before they migrated. They 
responded to interesting offers of work, apparently with binding contracts with reliable em-
ployers. Almost all of the males were victims of ‘other forms of exploitation’, but a few were 
also victimised in other ways: being sold as a child, being forced to beg and sexual exploita-
tion. Most of the men from Belarus ended up in the Russian Federation, as did many of the 
Ukrainian men. Other destinations were South East Europe, the EU, the United States of 
America, Turkey, Central Asia, Northern Asia and the Middle East. The men experienced

poor, often traumatising, working and living conditions, which damaged their physical and 
mental well-being. A combination of violence or the threat of violence, debts, not receiving 
payment and limited freedom of movement meant that the men were unable to break free 
from the situation of exploitation. Even if they they were able to, their problems were not 
necessarily solved; they were usually homeless, with no money or documents and no knowl-
edge of where they could go for help. Even when they were identified as victims of human 
trafficking, appropriate help was not always available. Elements of the ‘standard package’ for 
victims of human trafficking (shelter, medical care, psychological counselling, legal advice, 
safety, protection and help with reintegration, for example) are also relevant for male vic-
tims, but need to be adapted to their specific needs. For example, shelter is tailored mainly to 
women and medical assistance is geared mainly to the consequences of sexual exploitation. 
Furthermore, men are not always willing to accept help. Often, for example, because they do 
not feel they are the victims of human trafficking but regard their situation as one of ‘failed 
migration’.
Men are also exploited in prostitution in the Netherlands. Information from the police7 
shows that the victims include both victims of loverboys in the gay scene and foreign victims 
who are coerced into working in prostitution. Some victims are minors. In 2008, four shel-
ters were opened in the Netherlands with places for 40 men who are victims or are at risk of 
becoming victims of domestic violence, honour revenge or human trafficking.8 In February 
2009, the State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sport announced that 38 male victims 
had been accommodated in the shelters up to that time. They included victims of human 
trafficking,9 but the ministry did not know the precise number of victims of human traffick-
ing in the shelters.10

4.2.3  Victims of loverboys and other minors in prostitution

Despite the enormous concern about the problem of loverboys and minors working in pros-
titution, and although the figures show that minors are reported to CoMensha as victims of 
human trafficking every year, it is in practice difficult for researchers to identify minors in 
prostitution. For example, Goderie and Boutellier (2006), who investigated prostitution in 
Rotterdam, say that it is very difficult for researchers to trace minors working in prostitution 
because of the great secrecy surrounding the subject and because the minors move around a 
lot. Goderie and Boutellier do not provide any specific examples of underage prostitutes they

the Ministry of Health, Wefare and Sport (VWS) there are are now also shelters for men who are victims of 
domestic violence. Each city has ten shelters for men aged 14 and older who have been threatened. Men from 
anywhere in the Netherlands who need a place in a shelter can find one in any of these cities. See press release 
by Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, Opening of shelter for abused men, 10 February 2009.

found in the course of their research in Rotterdam, but they refer to other studies, describe 
the general situation with youth prostitution and conclude that ‘there can be no doubt that 
there are many minors working in prostitution’.
They did uncover various possible indications of exploitation, such as clients who had to 
pay the ‘driver’, girls who did not speak Dutch or English, very low prices, security guards 
in private homes and women who were clearly working reluctantly. In 2005 and 2006, the 
report Tippelen na de Zone by the Bonger Institute and a quick scan of teenage prostitution 
in Amsterdam by the municipal health service caused considerable disquiet in the Amster-
dam Zuidoost district, as the two studies showed that illegal prostitution, including teenage 
prostitution, was occurring there, although no statistics were provided. A quick scan in Am-
sterdam Zuidoost in 2008, based on a survey of the police, youth workers, employees of the 
Public Order and Safety Department, housing associations and other key figures, showed 
that illegal prostitution was still only a sporadic phenomenon in the urban district: little or 
no street prostitution was found, one illegal brothel was discovered and closed, few, if any, 
reports or other indications were received of prostitution in bars and there were only a few 
registered cases of girls from the district becoming victims of loverboys.
There can be no doubt that every minor working in prostitution is one too many and that in 
such cases, the social services must be called in; if there is exploitation, the suspects should 
be investigated and prosecuted. But research findings like these do raise questions about the 
scale of the problem. It is important in this context for the registration of youth prostitution 
proposed by CoMensha (when it was still STV) at the end of 2005 to quickly become opera-
tional and start yielding information.11

The Rood study
Rood, the youth section of the Socialist Party (SP) in Utrecht, conducted research into victims 
of loverboys. They talked to 21 women who had become victims of a loverboy. They were aged 
between 12 and 24 at the time and they had been victims for periods ranging from two days to 
seven years. The girls were forced to work in prostitution, perform in porn films, smuggle drugs 
or take out loans and pay the money to the offender. The majority of the 15 girls who pressed 
charges were put in touch with Victim Support Netherlands or specialist support agencies.12 

The Education Inspectorate has conducted research into sexual diversity and the ability to 
withstand sexual pressure in schools, including the issue of identifying signs of victims of 
loverboys.13 According to the report, there had been incidents relating to sexual pressure at 
many schools. A quarter to a third of the school managements in primary and secondary 

11 Kwiz developed a registration system in consultation with chain partners in the field and a meeting was held 
at the end of 2008 where partners could sign the associated agreements on privacy. Participating organisa-
tions can find the system on the CoMensha website and can access it with a password.

special-needs education and lower secondary vocational education (VMBO) had encoun-
tered loverboy practices. Case studies by the inspectorate confirm that picture.14 Eleven of 
the 35 schools reported incidents of loverboy practices. A large majority of the special-needs 
schools that were visited had experienced such incidents and there had also been incidents at 
a large majority of the VMBO schools. The police were contacted in connection with all of 
these incidents. The cases generally involved ‘cool boys in expensive cars’ parked in front of 
the school (which does not, in itself, necessarily indicate loverboy practices). According to 
the schools, most of the problems were resolved with extra patrols by the police and height-
ened alterness by the schools themselves.15 These types of incidents have generally not led to 
the formulation of explicit policy, but projects have often been started in response to them.16 
The Education Inspectorate describes it as remarkable that the incidents have not led to a 
preventive/curative policy or to a structural programme designed to increase the ability of 
pupils to withstand sexual pressure.

Case of complaint against school
Maria Mosterd, author of the book Echte men eten geen kaas, in which she described the period 
when she fell prey to a loverboy, lodged a complaint against her school in 2009. She argued that 
the school should have raised the alarm sooner when she was repeatedly absent from school. 
She accused the school of not protecting her from the loverboys who were operating around 
the school. She claimed almost €74,000 in damages and compensation. In 2006, the National 
Education Complaints Commission had rejected a complaint by Maria’s mother. At the time 
this report was written, the complaint had yet to be heard by the district court in Zwolle.

Since 2006, medical and psychology students have been providing information to pupils 
in the last two years of primary school as part of Tienerwijs, an educational project about 
relationships and sex. Tienerwijs is organised by the International Federation of Medical 
Students. The project is carried out in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Leiden, and there are 
plans for similar projects in Groningen and Maastricht.

4.2.4 	 Young	boys

The Bonger Institute of the University of Amsterdam carried out research for the Ministry 
of Justice’s Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) into boys who are sexually ex-
ploited and the prostitution of young males.17 This study was carried out following reports 

14 The inspectorate visited 35 schools, of which. 14 were VMBO schools, seven were general secondary educa-
tion (HAVO)/ pre-university (VWO) schools, six were special-needs schools and eight were secondary voca-
tional education (MBO) schools. Some schools referred to more than one incident. There were no reports of 
incidents at the HAVO/VWO schools.

in the media that large groups of underage ethnic males were being sexually exploited. The 
authors of the study tried to gain an insight into methods of preventing the sexual abuse of 
youths, the nature and circumstances of the abuse that occurred, the nature and scale of 
the activities performed by boys in prostitution, the ethnic origins of the members of this 
group and the extent to which these youths are known to the social services. The research-
ers concluded that it is impossible to reliably estimate the number of underage boys working 
in prostitution. There is evidence to suggest that this group constitutes a minority in male 
prostitution as a whole. One of the reasons for the impression that youth prostitution is so 
prevalent is that boys pretend to be younger than they really are because that is what the 
market wants. The ethnic preference of clients could also contribute to the impression that 
exists about the ethnicity of these prostitutes; the researchers could not confirm the theory 
that Moroccan boys are over-represented in youth prostitution.

Study of youth prostitution
The study involved field research at a number of locations in Amsterdam and Twente, where 
the researchers looked for indications of youth prostitution and networks around it. It proved 
difficult to establish contact with youths, who communicate via internet.
It was found that the subjects of the research engaged in various forms of prostitution. For 
some it was almost a daily activity and a regular source of income; for others, it was something 
they enjoyed doing and which they did in order to to be able to go out and buy luxury items. 
For others, it was a way of paying the rent, financing an addiction or securing free accommo-
dation.18 Clients were recruited in three ways: via internet, through work in a brothel or for an 
escort agency or informally, in which case clients were found in bars, by word of mouth, on the 
street, etc.
The study divided the youth prostitutes into three groups: (1) professionals and weekend ama-
teurs, (2) victims, and (3) adventurers. The members of the first category are all adults, in the 
other two groups the ages vary. The youngest group is over-represented in the third category 
(39% are minors). Most youths fall into the two latter categories, but this could be related to the 
age groups covered by the study.
The study found that all the subjects were victims of coercion and abuse since they had all had 
sex while still minors with a person in a ‘position of authority’,19 although the subjects them-
selves did not all regard this as abuse. Half of the group had had sex involuntarily at least once, 
and it was not always for payment. A third of them had experienced verbal violence, the threat 
of physical violence or actual physical violence. The study showed that each young person’s 
life history was different. The researchers concluded that sexual abuse was not the only reason 
that the youths entered prostitution.
Specialist help seems to reach older youth prostitutes almost exclusively, a group in which 
Eastern European youths are over-represented. Younger prostitutes do receive other types of 
assistance, but these agencies generally do not know that the young people engage in commer-
cial sex. The clinics for sexually transmitted diseases have the greatest reach, since the majority 
of the youths have contact with them.

18 These youths often stay for a lengthy period with one man, having sex with him in exchange for a place to 
stay. 

19 The researchers define a person in a position of authority as an adult or a minor who is at least five years 
older.

Victims and help for victims

113

In a letter of 9 June 2009,20 the Minister of Justice informed parliament about the results of 
the study. He reported that in the meantime CoMensha had started the Registration of Youth 
Prostitution project, which is designed to identify the problems facing the social services in 
relation to youth prostitution and, at the same time, form an impression of nationwide efforts 
to prevent youth prostitution. The minister said that more organisations would be actively en-
couraged to cooperate with the registration project, for which he was providing a subsidy. He 
did not feel that the findings of the study required him to take additional measures to help this 
group of young people.

PMW, an organisation that provides help for prostitutes in Rotterdam, devoted special at-
tention to youths exploited in prostitution in 2008. It hired a field worker specifically to es-
tablish contact with them both face-to-face and via internet. Three youths sought its help in 
2006, one in 2007 and seven in 2008. They could have been victims of human trafficking or 
young people who were working voluntarily in prostitution.

4.2.5  Roma children

Children from Eastern Europe, usually Romania, are regularly discovered selling newspa-
pers, playing music for money, begging or committing thefts or pickpocketing in the Neth-
erlands. They include children who are required to attend school but who do not, and it 
is not always clear whether they are in the care of a parent or guardian. Police and youth 
agencies have little control over these children and their carers. It is difficult for the Child 
Protection Council (Raad voor de Kinderbescherming) to intervene, for example, if the indi-
viduals in question are not registered with a municipality but are staying with compatriots, 
operate in places other than where they live and make sure not to stay in the same place for 
too long.21

The crisis service of the Youth Care Agency (Bureau Jeugdzorg) in Haaglanden has recently 
encountered more of these children, who may be victims of human trafficking. The agency 
in The Hague feels that the children should be returned to their country of origin and placed 
under the supervision of the youth-care services there. According to the agency, the children 
should be placed in closed youth care until it is known where they come from and where their 
parents are. It is, in any case, important to ensure that the children cannot run away or be 
removed by unauthorised persons. This would also send a signal to the gang that might be 
behind the exploitation. The possibility that the parents are responsible for the exploitation 
should also be taken into account.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

114

 
Klostermann22 carried out a pilot study of Eastern European children working in the 
Netherlands,23 looking at three cases of apparent crime in relation to underage Roma children 
and how they were dealt with in 2007. He also conducted interviews with the police, the EMM, 
the Romanian liaison officer, the Youth Care Agency, the Child Protection Council and school 
attendance officers. 
The three cases involved children who were not yet 12: (1) a girl playing music on the street in 
Den Bosch (the parents were present), (2) children begging in Tilburg (they were accompanied 
by adults, some of whom were involved in criminal behaviour, and there were inidications of 
youth prostitution), and (3) a young boy in Dordrecht who was caught trying to pick pockets 
(no accompanying adults).
The analysis of the cases highlighted a number of problems:

 – the relevant agencies, such as the municipality and social services, are unclear about which 
legal instruments can and should be used;

 – there is no systematic information or consistent policy as regards registration, partly be-
cause the agencies do not all regard incidents with Roma children as a structural problem 
(in terms of crime);

 – tackling the problem calls for cooperation between many agencies, but there is no joint pol-
icy;

 – the complexity of the problem (including the lifestyle of the persons in question, which can-
not be understood in a Dutch context) quickly leads to the practical choice of tackling the 
symptoms (adapting the municipal rules and moving them on);

 – a report by Europol also shows that this is a problem that has to be seen in a wider European 
context.

Klostermann made three recommendations:
 – better agreements on the registration of incidents, without it leading to the criminalisation 

of Roma as a group;
 – closer cooperation and better coordination between police and youth agencies at regional, 

supraregional and international levels in the interests of a consistent approach that corre-
sponds with a clearly formulated view of the problem;

 – the formulation of policy, based on knowledge about the children’s background and in coop-
eration with Roma organisations and Romanian agencies.

The Child Protection Council says it is an illusion to think that it is a problem that can be 
solved solely in the Dutch context24 and in mid-2008, it adopted a course of action designed 
to address it.25 The key points are:

 – as a second-line agency, the Council will investigate whether a child protection order is 
necessary and inform the court when it suspects that the minor has committed a criminal 
offence;

22 As part of the criminal intelligence training, 2008.
23 The research questions were: What is the crime problem in relation to underage (travelling) Roma in the 

Netherlands? What are the major problems in dealing with it? And what points of departure do subcultural 
and social theory offer for the policy of the Dutch police? 

24 That it is indeed an illusion is illustrated by the information from Europol about the Romania – United 
Kingdom joint investigation team (JIT). See later in this section.

 – the local offices will register the number of cases and notify the national office;
 – best practices will be posted on the Council’s intranet.

Best practices
Two municipalities have formulated a policy to address this problem. In Den Bosch, when a 
child is found on the street outside the school holidays and is unable to produce a certificate 
showing that he or she is not required to attend school in the country of origin, the incident 
is reported to the school attendance officer, who then enquires whether the child is registered 
with a school in the municipality and whether he or she regularly attends school.26 If not, the 
school attendance officer asks the RvdK to investigate. If parental authority is not being exer-
cised over the child, the Council will request the children’s court to issue a provisional custody 
order, whereupon the Youth Care Agency will exercise authority. If parental authority is being 
exercised, but the situation in which the child is being raised demands it, a child protection 
order (a supervision order) may be requested, which the Youth Care Agency will execute after 
it is granted by the children’s court. The agency investigates whether the child can stay in the 
Netherlands and what help is required, or whether the child should be accompanied back to 
the country of origin.27

In Amsterdam, a flow chart produced by the Council and some chain partners is used. The po-
lice investigate the child’s situation, by seeking information from the school attendance officer, 
for example. There are then four options:

 – If the child needs protection, the Youth Care Agency is notified. The agency decides whether 
the report should be passed on to the Child Protection Council. If necessary, a child protec-
tion order will be requested and shelter will be arranged. The Youth Care Agency and Nidos 
will investigate whether the child should be accompanied back to the country of origin.

 – If no parental authority is being exercised or the identiy of the guardian is unknown, the 
police notify the Youth Care Agency, which then assesses whether the Council needs to be 
called in. The Council investigates whether parental authority is absent and if necessary re-
quests an order assigning guardianship. Nidos is the agency designated to act as legal guardi-
an.28

 – If there is a suspicion that a child has committed a criminal offence, the police notify the 
Council, whereupon the Council orders an investigation and consults the public prosecution 
service on the most appropriate way to deal with the matter.29

 – If none of these options is possible, the child (and his or her parents) will be given a stern 
talking-to and clearly informed that their behaviour is regarded as inappropriate and unac-
ceptable in the Netherlands.

In 2009, Anti-Slavery International published a report on children who are forced to beg in 
Albania, Greece, India and Senegal.30 All 162 child beggars, former child beggars or children 
who faced the risk of being forced into begging in Albania and Greece covered in the report 

26 If the child lives outside Den Bosch, the other municipality takes over the case. 
27 Since this policy was announced, underage Roma musicians seem to be avoiding Den Bosch.
28 It is noteworthy that in Den Bosch, authority is delegated to the Youth Care Agency and in Amsterdam to 

Nidos. In the case of foreign children, it seems more logical to delegate authority to Nidos. 
29 The non-punishment principle is also relevant for cases where these children are forced to commit criminal 

offences. See Chapter 6.
30 Anti-Slavery International (2009).

were children from the Roma/Balkan-‘Egyptian’ groups. These children were forced to beg, 
either by their parents or by third parties. Of the 53 Albanian children interviewed at length, 
a third said that their parents used violence to force them to beg. The researchers believed 
it was possible that this group was even larger, but that children felt a deep sense of shame 
about telling of their parents’ involvement. The majority of the children were boys. All 19 
of the Albanian children forced to beg were younger than 14 or had stopped begging before 
reaching puberty. From 15 lengthy interviews with children who were forced by their parents 
to beg, it emerged that the children had to beg for at least six hours a day and that the families 
used the money to survive. The research also showed that poverty is an important cause of 
children being forced to beg, as are migration to urban areas and a lack of education. The 
report, which is not specifically concerned with the Netherlands, outlines the international 
context of the problem. The following information from Europol indicates that it is a major 
problem that extends beyond the Netherlands.

Joint Investigation Team: Trafficking of children from Romania to the UK
In 2007, Europol was advised of parallel investigations in the UK and Romania targeting the 
exploitation of hundreds of Romanian Roma children, who had been trafficked from Romania 
to other EU states. The persons responsible were identified as a Romanian organised crime 
group, based in Romania but with significant links and bases of operation elsewhere in Eu-
rope.
As a result of the circulation of a list of 1107 children suspected of having been trafficked, it 
was established that at least 200 of the names on the list were on police databases in the UK. 
It was suspected that large numbers of the children were being forced into the commission of 
criminal offences on behalf of the traffickers. The exploitation of the children in the UK was 
connected to ‘street crime’ offences such as pickpocketing, bag snatching, aggressive begging, 
shoplifting, and distraction thefts. It has since been established that the organised crime group 
have earned millions of euros from the exploitation of these children and it has recently been 
learned that the traffickers are now using the children for the purpose of defrauding the UK’s 
social security benefits system.
This investigation, which remains current, is being carried out within the framework of a Joint 
Investigation Team (JIT) that began on 1 September 2008 and has led to the secondment of 
Romanian police officers to the Metropolitan Police in London. The JIT has allowed unprec-
edented investigative actions, such as victim and witness interviews, conducted by Romanian 
prosecutors in London, and has also led to multiple deployments of Europol officers to support 
the collection and analysis of intelligence with a mobile office.

4.2.6 Victims in aliens detention

The people held in aliens detention include victims of human traffickingNRM5. Several yeas 
ago, Bonded Labour in the Netherlands (BLinN) conducted research on this topic,31 which 
showed that identification was too late if a victim was already in detention, since it was then 
seldom possible to report human trafficking and secure B9 status. This problem was ad-

dressed and the fifth report of the NRM indicated that the situation had improved; however, 
the problems have not yet been fully resolved. Since 2005, BLinN has been helping victims 
of human trafficking and trying to improve the identification of victims in detention. It re-
ported that in the period 2006 – 2008 it reached 112 possible victims (the number of ‘genuine’ 
victims is probably significantly lower): 88 women and 24 men. They included 48 in border 
detention (under Article 6 of the Aliens Act)32 and 64 in aliens detention (under Article 59 
of the Aliens Act).33 Countries of origin included Nigeria (39), China (20), India (10), Sierra 
Leone (6), Ghana (5), Cameroon (5), Moldavia (3) and 21 other countries (1 or 2 persons from 
each). BLinN reported its findings in Uitgebuit en in de bak! Slachtoffers van mensenhandel in 
vreemdelingendetentie.34 According to that report, it was still not easy to make a report hu-
man trafficking from aliens detention, partly because exploitation outside the sex industry 
is not always recognised as human trafficking and partly because there is considerable suspi-
cion of the complainant’s motives. BLinN devoted a lot of time to advising the individuals on 
the report of the crime. Ultimately, 35 of the victims made a report of human trafficking and 
were granted B9 status. BLinN also offered individual assistance, even to victims who were 
to be deported or who were cooperating with their return (occasionally after they had been 
released from detention), and organised group activities (workshops dedicated to health 
and ‘surviving in detention’). Boermans (2009) says that aliens detention ís unsuitable for 
victims of human trafficking, many of whom are traumatised, and describes the downward 
spiral they enter and the psychological and physical problems they experience. Boermans 
also describes how the centres are not equipped to deal with traumatised victims, or vari-
ous other problems, including the fact that the detention sector does not regard identifying 
victims as part of its task35. Providing information to and cooperation with the staff of the 
centres is a precondition for identifying victims. But things also go wrong even in the period 
prior to and after detention.

Findings from the BLinN study of victims in aliens’ detention
Boermans observed that police forces still sometimes err by failing to identify victims, by fail-
ing to respond promptly or correctly to requests to make a report of the crime human traffick-
ing, or by not offering a reflection period as required by the B9 regulation. Another problem 
is that cases are sometimes dropped without an official decision not to prosecute: the case is 
‘shelved’ and the victims or their lawyers are not always informed about the decision to shelve 
the case, or to drop the prosecution, so the periods for making an objection to the decision not 
to prosecute and to appeal against revocation of the B9 status expire without their realising it. 
Boermans also mentions the limited task of the Repatriation and Departure Service (DT&V) 
as a problem: the service reports possible victims of human trafficking to the police or the 
Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, and if no action is taken it proceeds with the deportation pro-

35 However, see also the Repatriation and Depature Service’s Protocol for processing victims of human traf-

ficking from the beginning of 2008, which describes, among other things, what has to be done if there is an 
indication that a person is a victim of human trafficking.

cedure. He also refers to the reactive role played the IND’s gender liaison officers, who do not 
personally identify victims but merely respond to notifications by the police and Marechaussee, 
and to lawyers, who do not always do their work properly or are not sufficiently aware of the 
issue of human trafficking and the accompanying procedures. Problems also occur in the tran-
sition from detention to assistance: for example, there is a shortage of places in shelters and a 
lack of knowledge about aliens detention, and there are no facilities for victims who decline or 
don’t dare toreport the crime.
In response to the report, the government said that many measures had been taken since 2005 
to improve the identification of victims and that the matter receives constant attention36. It is 
important to maintain the quality of the process of early and careful identification of victims. 
Nevertheless, the detention of (presumed) victims of human trafficking cannot always be pre-
vented, according to the State Secretary. Victims are sometimes only identified when they are 
already in detention. The State Secretary said, in fact, that the numbers of victims mentioned 
did not tally with the figures available to her37.

4.2.7 	 Victims	with	a	slight	mental	handicap

The fifth report of the NRM referred to the particular vulnerability of slightly mentally 
handicapped38 persons to exploitation. Victims in this category are still being identified, also 
by the police.39 Loverboys are said to target mentally handicapped girls and women in their 
recruiting and officials in the shelters for victims have become aware of the fact that some 
problems in caring for foreign victims are related to the weak mental capacity of these vic-
tims. The MEE (a national social pedagogic service with regional offices that provides help 
for people with a handicap, physical disablity or chronic disease, including people with a 
slight mental handicap) is nowadays one of the partners in a number of networks to provide 
assistance for victims and in loverboy projects. The State Secretary for Health, Welfare and 
Sport has also said that the Centre of Expertise for Youth Prostitution has included a pro-
posal to provide advice and training in seven insititutions for slightly mentally handicapped 
persons in its plan of activities for 2009.40

4.3	 Registration	of	data	about	victims

4.3.1  Statistics on victims

One of CoMensha’s most important tasks is to keep a national register of (suspected) vic-
tims of human trafficking. However, up to now it has proved impossible to register more 
than the basic characteristics of most victims, such as country of origin, age and gender. Part

of the reason for this is that CoMensha depends on information that is provided in many 
different ways, from a large number of agencies41. As a result, we do not know very much 
about the victims, and the possibility of double-counting cannot be ruled out. The victims 
registered by CoMensha are not victims who can be regarded as ‘official victims’ by virtue of 
a formal assessment on the basis of specific criteria, after a conviction in a criminal trial, for 
example. This is particularly important when these figures – as happens more and more of-
ten – are compared with data on victims from other countries, where registration may might 
also cover official victims, but might cover only victims who have received assistance or only 
those who have been formally recognised.
It is generally acknowledged that there is a need for a uniform system of registering victims, 
at both the national and international level. A number of international initiatives have been 
taken, which highlight the importance of good registration.42

In 2007, the first trend report on the position of victims of human trafficking was published by 
the consultancy firm Van Montfoort and the Verwey-Jonker Institute.43 This so-called ‘victim 
monitor’ represented an attempt to identify the situation of victims in terms of seven aspects: 
(1) identification, (2) access to and use of the B9 regulation, (3) legal advice and criminal pro-
ceedings, (4) shelter/housing, (5) health care, (6) income and education, and (7) continued resi-
dence or repatriation. The aim was to improve the methods of measuring the effects of policy 
interventions. The trend report said, among other things, that it is generally known that there 
are constraints to the use of existing registration systems and that the data in the registration 
systems are not always complete, which limits the reliability of the key figures collected in the 
Human Trafficking Monitor. The report’s main proposal was to improve the registration by 
CoMensha, as the central agency for reporting all victims of human trafficking in prostitu-
tion.
The intention is to publish the monitor every two years, but that will not be done until the sys-
tem of registration has improved.

Since the registration of victims is a core task of CoMensha, the Ministry of Justice has ear-
marked additional funds for its subsidy to CoMensha to enable it to improve its records. 
According to the progress report on the Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan, Co-
Mensha has submitted a plan for a project to improve its registration by determining, in 
consultation with the parties that supply the information, what datasets should be provided 
and securing a commitment to deliver the information.44

4.3.2	 Registration	of	victims	by	CoMensha

This section contains information about (suspected) victims registered by CoMensha and 
is based largely on their databases, although the figures presented differ in several respects 
from the figures in CoMensha’s annual reports. Where the figures refer to those in the an-
nual reports, that fact is explicitly mentioned The number of victims has grown steadily in 
recent years, from 579 in 2006, to 716 in 2007 and 826 in 2008.

Country of origin
Table 4.1 contains a ranking of the five most common countries of origin of victims in each 
year.45

As in the three previous years, in 2007 and 2008 the Netherlands was the most common 
country of origin of victims of human trafficking. China, Nigeria, and Hungary occupied 
positions two to four in 2008, and accordingly China’s emergence as a leading country of 
origin has continued. A noteworthy newcomer in the list is Sierra Leone.

The victims registered by CoMensha in 2008 had 62 different nationalities. Table 4.2 lists 
the most common.47 In Appendix 4, Table B1 provides a complete list of all nationalities, in

The percentage of Dutch victims has increased in each of the last five years and in 2008, 39% 
(320) of the victims reported to CoMensha were from the Netherlands. A relatively large 
proportion of victims registered in 2008 came from China (9%) and Nigeria (8%). However, 
whereas the relative number of Chinese victims almost doubled from 2007 to 2008 (going 
from 5% to 9%), the number of Nigerian victims almost halved (dropping from 15% to 8%).

As in the preceding years, most of the reported victims in 2007 and 2008 were aged between 
18 and 23. The number of reports of underage victims rose in 2007 (from 103 in 2006 to 199 
in 2007) and declined slightly again in 2008 (169). This trend is particularly evident in the 
10-to-14 age group (from 10 in 2006, to 29 in 2007 and to seven in 2008).

Investigated is whether the number of minors among Dutch victims is different than among 
foreign victims. Table 4.4 shows that 37% of the Dutch victims in 2007 were minors, com-
pared with 22% of foreign victims. The corresponding percentages in 2008 were 33% and 
13% respectively. These differences are significant.51

At least half of all underage victims in 2007 were Dutch; in 2008 the figure was 62%. At 
least half of all foreign underage victims came from Nigeria in 2007, but in 2008 Nigeria no 
longer stood out in this respect. The likely reason for this is the investigation in the ‘Koolvis’ 
case, which continued until the end of 2007 and in which many of the victims were underage 
Nigerian girls.52

124

The number of women among the newly reported victims in 2006, 2007 and 2008 fluctu-
ated around 94%. In 2007, the number of underage girls rose from 18% to 27%, but in 2008 
the figure fell again to 21%. The number of men fell slightly in 2008 (from 49 to 46), and the 
proportion of minors among them declined particularly sharply, from 33% (16) to 11% (5).
The countries of origin of the male victims in 2008 were:55 China (12), India (8), Nigeria (7), 
Sierra Leone (6), Netherlands (3), Egypt (2), Canada, Chile, Cameroon, Morocco, Romania, 
Sudan, Surinam and Vietnam (one each).56

The number of reports of male victims has been significantly higher since 2006, probably 
because of the increased attention to exploitation outside the sex industry and the launch 
of investigations into this type of human trafficking. Only one male victim was reported in 
2004, and in 2005 the 424 newly reported victims included only two males, both of whom 
were in fact exploited in prostitution.57

As Table 4.7 shows, with respect to a significant share of the victims registered with CoMen-
sha in 2007 and 2008 (32% and 29% respectively), it is not known which sectors they were 
exploited in. With respect to those about whom that information is known, almost half of 
all registered victims in 2007, and more than half in 2008, were exploited in the sex industry. 
Only around 3% of all victims in 2007 and 2008 were exploited in one of the ‘other forms of 
exploitation’ in a sector listed in the table. All of the victims of ‘other forms of exploitation’ 
came from abroad in both years. The case of the male victim who was forced to donate an 
organ in 2007 is interesting. It was the first report of a victim of organ trafficking in the Neth-
erlands. The case involved an 20-year-old Indian man who was reported to CoMensha by the 
Groningen police. This (possible) victim claimed that he had been forced to donate a kidney. 
It is unclear whether that really happened because shortly after he was offered the reflection 
period, the man disappeared and his whereabouts are unknown.73

66 This should actually be three, since one female victim was exploited in the hospitality sector and another 
sector. In this table she is registered only under the other so that the totals add up to 100%. 

67 Hence, the total is actually nine victims.
68 Hence, two of these female victims were also exploited in the sex industry.
69 This should actually be 13, since one female victim was exploited in domestic service and in another sector. 

In this table she is registered only under the other sector so that the totals in the table add up to 100%.
70 Hence the total is actually 13 victims.
71 The category ‘other’ can be either sexual or other forms of exploitation. 
72 This is not the same as the sum of the percentages in this column. That is because the individual percentages 

have been rounded off to whole numbers

Of the 343 victims who were exploited (at least partly) in the sex industry in 2007, a quarter 
were minors (84 victims). In 2008, that figure had dropped to one-fifth (93 underage victims 
in the sex industry). In 2008, one minor was exploited in the hospitality sector.74

Notifiers
Table 4.8 provides a list of the different categories of notifiers in the period from 2004 to 
2008. In some cases, several different organisations were involved in a notification. Since 
2007, CoMensha has recorded the names of every organisation involved in a notification. 
Consequently, the aggregate figures in the table since 2007 exceed the number of victims and 
the totals do not add up to 100%.

74 Five minors worked in the sectors included in the category ‘other’.
75 These include all police services that might be involved with human trafficking.
76 The networks for victims of human trafficking were set up by CoMensha in order to provide integrated help 

for victims. The networks are supervised by a care coordinator or – if there isn’t a care coordinator– by Co-
Mensha itself. The few reports received from the networks were previously classified in the category ‘shelter 
facilities’. Because of the increase in the number of reports from the networks in 2006, they were included 
as a separate category in the STV’s 2006 annual report, and hence also in this table.

77 The Royal Netherlands Marechaussee reported (possible) victims for the first time in 2006; hence this sepa-
rate category in the STV’s 2006 annual report and in this table. The reports by the Marechaussee are the 
result of the activities of the Sluis team that intercepts (potential) victims at Schiphol airport.

78 Including public shelters and women’s shelters and religious, private or local initiatives.
79 These are professional groups that work in notification centres, shelters and asylum centres, such as 

VluchtelingenWerk, but also counsellors and medical staff, the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum 
Seeekers (COA) and the aliens holding centre (Grenshopitium) at Schiphol

80 General social work and social work for prostitutes.

As in previous years, the largest number of notifications in 2007 and 2008 were made by the 
police, followed at some distance by the networks for victims of human trafficking.

Other information about victims supplied by CoMensha
Although there was little information recorded about many of the victims in 2007 and 2008, 
some details that may be of interest are presented here. The following figures and percentages 
have to be regarded as a minimum because of the missing data, so they are not compared with 
the data in the earlier reports for 2005 and 2006.
Of the victims reported to CoMensha in 2007 and 2008, it is at least known that:

 – 27 of the female victims were pregnant (10 in 2007 and 17 in 2008);
 – 188 female victims had children (83 in 2007 and 105 in 2008);
 – 104 victims wanted to return to their country of origin (52 in 2007 and 52 in 2008).

This limited database highlights once again the importance of systematically recording data on 
the basis of international standards (see §4.3.1 and §3.2 above).

4.3.3	 Victims	and	the	B9	regulation

Applications and permits
Table 4.9 shows how many aliens submitted applications for B9 status per year, and how 
many applications were granted per year.

83 The category ‘commuinity services’ (without specification) was introduced in the STV’s annual report for 
2004. Previously, the category ‘legal services’ had been used (legal aid offices, citizen’s advice centres, vic-
tim’s aid offices and lawyers). The STV’s annual report for 2006 included both categories. For the purposes 
of comparison, the two categories have been merged in Table 4.8 for 2006; the data for 2004 and 2005 are 
for ‘community services’ and from 2006 they are for a combination of both.

84 These can be family, friends or a partner of the victim. Sometimes a report comes from a client (STV annual 
report, 2006). 

85 It is noticeable that in 2005 many notifiers were categorised as ‘unknown’. None had been classified as ‘un-
known’ previously. In 2006 there were a few and later none at all again.

Around 80% of the B9 permits applied for were granted each year in the period from 2005 to 
2007. In 2008, however, the proportion fell to 53%. However, the actual number of applica-
tions and permits granted increased sharply in that year. This increase in applications and 
the relative decline in the number granted may be explained by the fact that more ‘hopeless 
B9 applications’ were made in 2008 than in previous years.86

Reflection period, reports
Tables 4.10 to 4.12 show how many foreign victims registered by CoMensha were offered a 
reflection period, how many of these victims accepted the reflection period, and how many

While the percentage of foreign victims who are offered the reflection period has grown an-
nually (from 23% in 2006 to 40% in 2008), the number of foreign victims who ultimately ac-
cept the reflection period when it is offered has fluctuated over the years, from 49% in 2006 
to 87% in 2007 and 67% in 2008.
The victims that accepted the reflection period made a report in roughly 60% of cases in 
2007 and 2008. This figure is very high compared with the percentage of complaints made 
by all victims registered with CoMensha, (33% in 2007 and 30% in 2008). In 2007 and 2008, 
18% and 11% of all victims who reported had Dutch nationality.
The results and trends described here need to be qualified with the knowledge that a large 
amount of information is unknown, as is apparent from Tables 4.10 to 4.12. It is also uncer-
tain whether CoMensha is aware of all cases involving a reflection period.

B9 permits
B9 permits are granted to victims or witnesses who have pressed charges of human traffick-
ing, who are living illegally in the Netherlands and are willing to cooperate with the police 
and public prosecution service. In 2008, the IND awarded 235 B9 residence permits,89 which 
is more than in previous years. See Appendix 2.5 for an explanation of the research and some 
additional reservations about the data.

Table 4.13 shows the breakdown by age of victims or witnesses who received B9 status be-
tween 2005 and 2008.

89 In the initial procedure, 221 B9 permits were granted. Objections and appeals led to an additional 14 B9 per-
mit s being granted.

In all of the years studied, roughly half of the persons granted a B9 residence permit were 
aged between 18 and 26. Seventeen minors were granted a B9 residence permit in 2007, and 
18 in 2008.90 The number of minors granted a B9 residence permit therefore remained stable 
in absolute terms in 2008 but was smaller in relative terms.

Table 4.14 shows the gender of victims and witnesses who were granted B9 status between 
2005 and 2008.

The shift in terms of the gender of the victims (more male victims, as a result of the expan-
sion of the legal provision on human trafficking) that started in 2006 did not continue. The 
percentage of B9 permits granted to male victims stabilised at around 10%.

90 As in previous years, children of victims and children of witnesses are also registered – incidentally and 
mistakenly – as recipients of B9 permits under the heading of minors. For example, in both 2007 and 2008 
one of the minors appears in the same file as an adult victim, which strongly indicates a parent-child relation-
ship.

In 2007 and 2008, once again a very large proportion (almost a quarter) of the victims/wit-
nesses of human trafficking granted a B9 residence permit were Nigerian. As in 2006, Ni-
geria again topped the list of countries of origin of victims and witnesses with B9 status. In 
2008, China ranked second, with a growing number of victims/witnesses with B9 status. 
The third-ranked country was Sierra Leone. In 2006, the second and third places were occu-
pied by Romania and Bulgaria, countries from where the number of victims with B9 status 
has been declining slightly.

91 A nationality is included in the table if five or more victims or witnesses who received a B9 permit possessed 
that nationality in at least one of the years between 2005 and 2008.

Africa has been the region of origin of the largest proportion of victims and witnesses grant-
ed a B9 residence permit since 2006. Asia’s share has grown, while that of Europe – par-
ticularly the new (candidate) member states in 2004 and the non-EU countries in Eastern 
Europe – has declined.97

statement, which is ex officio treated as an application for a temporary residence permit un-
der the B9 regulation. Table 4.17 presents a list of the police regions where the applications

4.4	 Compensation98

The various possibilities open to victims of human trafficking for claiming compensation 
for material damages or emotional injury were decribed in the fifth report of the NRM.99 
Two of these options are discussed in more detail in this section: (1) the order to pay com-
pensation that the judge can impose in criminal proceedings and which is executed by the 
Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB), and (2) the right to make a claim to the Violent Of-
fences Compensation Fund (SGM). The analysis is concerned mainly with the benefits of 
these procedures for the victims.

The order for compensation
The judge in criminal proceedings can, either on request or ex officio, order the payment 
of compensation when passing sentence. Data from the public prosecution service provide 
(some) information about judicial decisions concerning compensation. The use of the order 
for compensation is discussed at length in NRM5. This section is concerned mainly with the 
execution of the order for compensation by the CJIB, which collects the amount owed to the 
victim.

The CJIB
When the judge makes an order to pay compensation in criminal proceedings, the CJIB col-
lects the compensation for the victim. Table 4.18 presents some data about the collection of 
compensation in human trafficking cases. Acquired from the CJIB, the data relate to cases 
against individual, anonymous defendants.

98 The subject of compensation for victims of human trafficking is discussed at length in Chapter 11, although 
the subject is covered largely from the perspective of criminal procedure. It focuses mainly on the way in 
which the criminal judge assesses the claim of the injured party. In almost every case, the order for compen-
sation is imposed in combination with the award of the injured party’s claim. 

99 Including the civil proceedings and the joinder of the injured party in the criminal proceedings.

100 The figures on claims for and the award of compensation in the 108 human trafficking cases in 2007 are pre-
sented in section 11.11. There were at least 21 claims awarded in 16 judgments in which an order for compen-
sation was made, although Table 4.18 shows 17 claims in 13 cases. A possible explanation for this discrepancy 
is that a judgment is not yet final in all cases and the order has therefore not yet been registered by the CJIB.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

136

In the period from 2000 to 2003, the CJIB collected compensation in three to five human 
trafficking cases. The number has been significantly higher since 2003, between nine and 
17 cases. The CJIB only receives the claims when the judgments have become final. This 
is sometimes in the same year that the offence was committed, but can also be many years 
later.101 Most of the claims are for a single victim; others are for two victims and occasionally 
for three or four. Generally speaking, the amounts claimed – per case, not per victim – are 
not more than €5,000, occasionally they are higher, and in four cases102 (in the period 2000-
2008) the amounts were higher than €35,000.103 Collecting compensation is a time-consum-
ing business, as is apparent from the large number of outstanding cases from earlier years (in 
the table under ‘status’). The fact that a case is still open does not in fact mean that nothing 
has yet been paid. The court might decide, for example, that the compensation can be paid 
in instalments,104 which means that a case is, by definition, open longer. In certain cases and 
under strict conditions,105 the CJIB can also agree a payment schedule (an arrangement to 
pay in instalments or to delay payment for a specific period).106 By comparing the cases in the 
table in which there was a claim with those where has been a financial settlement, it is obvi-
ous that in many cases, the amount has either not ben paid or has been only partially paid.
When the convicted person does not pay or does not pay in full, recourse through the public 
prosecutor is possible.107 If that doesn’t work, the public prosecutor may issue an arrest war-
rant to execute the custodial alternative (the court decision already specifies how many days 
the defendant will have to serve if he or she does not pay). The custody does not in fact re-
place the compensation, but is intended to exert pressure. The involvement of the CJIB ends 
after the defendant has been placed in custody. If this does not produce any result, the matter 
is transferred to the victim, who is given a judgement with which he or she can authorise a 
bailiff to execute the decision (but the victim is then, in fact, left almost empty-handed).
Since 2005, the CJIB has also had the task of informing victims about the collection of their 
compensation. The Victim Compensation Information Centre (SIS) has gradually assumed 
this task from the various offices of the public prosecution service, a process that was com-
pleted at the end of 2006. According the CJIB’s records, in 2007 and 2008 letters were sent 
to a large majority of the 36 victims concerned asking whether they wanted to be kept in-
formed of progress with their claim. Seventeen said that they did wish to be kept informed.

101 For example, in 2006 the CJIB received a claim for an offence committed in 1994.
102 Two in 2004 and two in 2005.
103 These were €42,500 and (rounded off) € 167,000 in 2004 and € 38,000 and € 204.000 in 2005.
104 “These periods are fixed at a minimum of one and a maximum of three months. In the event of a judgment, 

they may not exceed a period of two years; in the case of an out of court settlement, they may not exceed a 
period of one year” (Article 24a, Dutch Code of Civil Procedure).

105 For these conditions, see: Council of Procurators General Instruction on execution of alternative sentences 
of imprisonment, community service for adults, fines, orders of compensation and confiscation, European 
monetary sanctions and applications for conditional release (2008A013), appendix 3 (entered into force on 1 
July 2008, valid until 30 June 2012). 

106 See also Van Wingerden, Moerings & Van Wilsem (2007). 
107 This can be done with or without an order enforcing execution (see Articles 575 and 576, Dutch Code of 

Civil Procedure).

Victims and help for victims

137

To sum up, it can be concluded that although an order for compensation means that the vic-
tim does not personally have to chase after the convicted person to collect the money, there 
is no guarantee of an (early) settlement or that the ultimate outcome will be positive.

In that context, it is important for the bill to strengthen the position of the victim in criminal 
proceedings108 to include an arrangement for advance payments, to be implemented by the 
Violent Crimes Compensation Fund. The Minister of Justice has explained that this provi-
sion is intended for victims of violent crimes and crimes against public decency. The crimes 
falling under these headings will be further defined by Order in Council, but it seems obvi-
ous that the scheme will also apply to victims of human trafficking.

The Violent Offences Compensation Fund(SGM)
Various criteria have to be met to qualify for financial compensation from the compensation 
fund. The violent offence must have been committed intentionally in the Netherlands, the 
victim must have suffered severe physical and/or emotional injury, the victim must not have 
been jointly guilty of the offence, the victim must not be able to recover compensation in any 
other way and the offence must not have occurred before 1973. Of particular relevance in the 
Violent Offences Compensation Fund Committee’s policy towards assessing applications 
from victims of human trafficking (up to now almost exclusively women, all victims of sexual 
exploitation109) is the extent to which the applicant was in a state of dependency sufficient to 
force him or her to perform sexual activities. Circumstances that could play a role in the as-
sessment of whether or not a violent offence occured are whether the victim’s passport was 
confiscated, the victim had to surrender all or most of the earnings, the victim was under 
constant supervision or locked up, the victim’s freedom of movement was constrained or the 
victim was intimidated or assaulted.
In 2007, SGM received 25 applications from victims of human trafficking. Eighteen of them 
were awarded.110

In 2008, 19 applications relating to human trafficking were submitted.111 They were re-
ceived from five different law firms, Victim Support Netherlands, Juridisch Loket, BLinN 
and Stichting Humanitas. Eighteen of the applications were awarded and one was rejected. 
The rejection was connected with the fact that the woman in question had not reported hu-
man trafficking and that further investigation by the compensation fund and the woman’s 
own statements had not plausibly shown that it was a case of human trafficking. Seven of 
the applications that were awarded involved situations in which the woman concerned en-
tered prostitution more or less voluntarily but where the situation had become one of forced

109 One case concerned a foreign man who was repeatedly sold as a slave and forced to perform sexual acts with 

various people.

prostitution.112 The awards involved compensation for emotional injury in category four (12 
times), category two (3 times) and categories five and six (one time each).113

On the subject of compensation for victims, the Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan 
reviewed the use of (among other things114) the Violent Crimes Compensation Fund and for-
mulated a ‘quick win’ to be achieved in this area. Its aim was to complete a survey of the use of 
the Violent Crimes Compensation Fund by victims of human trafficking before 1 July 2009. 
It also said that an action plan should be drawn up to increase the use of this service.115

4.5	 Victims,	and	reports	of	human	trafficking116

General
Victims of human trafficking have various entitlements (see later in this chapter), and aliens 
also have certain rights under immigration law. This is one reason why it is important to 
establish whether a person can and should be regarded as a victim. After all there is a lot 
at stake, and not just for the victim personally. It is also important in the interests of com-
bating human trafficking through investigation and prosecution of human traffickers. The 
identification of victims is usually a first step in that process; the complaint made by a victim 
can form the basis for further investigation and prosecution.117 Although a victim can also 
benefit from a prosecution, and particularly a conviction, in practice there are obstacles to 
reporting relating to fear of, or even attachment to, the human trafficker. It is therefore im-
portant to remove as many obstacles as possible that could prevent victims from reporting 
and to take measures that will help victims to take that step. This is the purpose of the B9 
regulation (see Chapter 5), under which illegal immigrants who might be victims of human 
trafficking can be granted a reflection period to decide calmly whether they wish to report 
or otherwise cooperate with an investigation. During that period they can remain legally in 
the Netherlands.

Reports of human trafficking made in the Haaglanden region
There are a number of small organisations in the Haaglanden region that provide help for vic-
tims of human trafficking, usually operating in the prostitution sector. These organisations, 
such as Vital Aid Netherlands and the Lydia Foundation, help women, mainly African women, 
to report human trafficking to the police. The number of investigations into human trafficking 
in the Haaglanden region doubled from 43 in 2007 to 88 in 2008. The number of reports made 
by African women rose from 14 to 42 in the same period (annual report of the Haaglanden 
police). Recording these reports takes a lot of time, leaving less time for investigation. These

116 More information about complaints and willingness to press charges can be found in Chapter 5.
117 A case can also be investigated and prosecuted without a complaint by a (possible) victim. On this point, see 

also Chapter 8.

cases often provide few leads for an investigation, whereupon the investigation is halted in 
consultation with the public prosecution service. The number of official reports submitted was 
12 in both years.118

This example clearly shows that help for immigrants in reporting the crime can lead to a 
sharp increase in the number of complaints119 but, at the same time, could create the risk that 
more capacity has to be devoted to less promising cases.

Making it easier to make a report is also one of the elements in the Human Trafficking Task 
Force’s action plan. The conditions experienced by victims while in a shelter can be very 
decisive. Social workers argue that the willingness of victims to report increases if they are 
accommodated in a closed environment and receive help tailored to their needs.

Anonymity when reporting human trafficking
The Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan120 refers to the letter from the Minister of 
Justice and the Minister of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations in response to the results 
of the study entitled Anonimiteit in het strafproces.121 The study also addressed human traf-
ficking and measures to combat it, although the recommendations in the report are not spe-
cifically intended for victims of human trafficking. These recommendations include the fol-
lowing points designed to increase anonymity in criminal proceedings. Choice of domicile 
– concealment of the address of the victim or witness when this is not relevant for the evi-
dence in the trial – will be used more often. Complainants will also be identifiable only with 
a unique identification number rather than an address.122 The public prosecution service, the 
police and victims could make more frequent use of the status ‘witness with limited anonym-
ity’ on the grounds of Articles 190 and 290 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure. The 
relevant guidelines and procedures of the public prosecution service123 will be amended to 
promote this, and the police professional code will be reviewed124. Articles 190 and 290 of the 
Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure will also be reviewed to see whether a more subjective 
criterion can be adopted for the risk that a witness faces or might face because of his or her 
testimony.125

One reservation to these measures, which are designed to make it easier to make a complaint 
by providing anonymity, is that in practice the human trafficker is usually able to easily iden-
tify which of his victims must have provided the information, so the victim’s fear of reper-

122 The anonymity may be lifted again when the enquiries become a criminal investigation. It was stated that 

this will be studied further in a pilot project.
123 This is the manual for ‘taking a (partially) anonymous complaint/statement’.
124 The professional code describes the relationship between the police and victims.
125 This point will be further reviewed in the legislative process for the Amendment of the Dutch Code of Civil 

Procedure with regard to the position of the witness in criminal proceedings.

cussions from the offender will not really be removed. Accordingly, this type of measure 
has only limited applicability for the offence of human trafficking. It also remains uncertain 
whether the anonymity can actually be permanently guaranteed, given the basic principles 
of criminal law such as equality of arms. The so-called programmatic approach, where infor-
mation is collected from various sources, could perhaps offer a solution. Accumulating that 
information would reduce the relative importance of and dependence on a complaint.

Reporting human trafficking
On behalf of the public prosecution service’s research department, the Verwey Jonker In-
stitute launched a study into the willingness of victims of human trafficking to report the 
offence. Unfortunately, this research was halted before it was completed.

ROOD, the youth section of the SP in Utrecht, Pretty Woman and a former victim of exploi-
tation by a loverboy produced a descriptive study of the problems experienced by victims of 
loverboys in making complaints and the role of the police in the process.126

4.6	 Shelter	for	victims	of	human	trafficking

4.6.1 General

Victims of human trafficking very often need help: help to escape from the situation they 
have been forced into, help to recover and help to work through traumatic experiences, to 
be able to contribute to a possible trial of the human traffickers, to follow procedures they 
themselves are involved in and sometimes to return to their country of origin.
In practice, however, it is frequently difficult to find suitable shelter, not only for specific 
categories of victims of human trafficking, such as men, minors and victims with particular 
problems such as psychiatric complaints or addictions. Even female victims of exploitation 
in the sex industry are not always certain of receiving shelter immediately. The waiting time 
can stretch from several days to several weeks. According to information from CoMensha,127 
at the beginning of September 2009, there were 15 clients waiting for initial shelter and 28 
waiting to move onto another setting where they could receive help. The situation had been 
similar in the preceding months. A victim is sometimes held in a police cell.128 It is also often 
impossible to provide shelter immediately for victims at Schiphol. Until there is a place for 
them, they are held as detainees on remand or kept in the lounge.129

The seriousness of the problem with regard to ‘categorical shelter’ is apparent from the fol-
lowing e-mail from the Royal Dutch Marechaussee.

Victims and help for victims

141

 
“On 16 April 2008 we received a telephone call reporting a possible victim of human trafficking. The 
first interview by an employee of the AC IND Schiphol produced sufficient indications that it could 
be a case of human trafficking. After careful consultation, it was decided that this 19-year-old woman 
would be interviewed at the end of the 48-hour asylum procedure.
She was interviewed on Monday 21 April 2008. Various indications of human trafficking and sexual 
abuse emerged from the interview. The interviewing detectives offered her the B9 regulation and 
she accepted the reflection period. She was seriously traumatised and needed expert counselling and 
help. Unfortunately, there was no place available at the HVO de Roggeveen on Monday. The HVO 
is the first point of contact for the Marechaussee at Schiphol when it wants to find shelter for adult 
victims of human trafficking. We have only praise for their cooperation because they really do their 
very best and the municipality of Amsterdam is also very cooperative in looking for solutions. From 
today CoMensha is looking for a place in a shelter for her, up to now without success. For all that 
time she has been in the AC Schiphol and should actually have already left at the weekend.”130

A victim is sometimes moved several times and non-specialist shelters for women, where 
most victims end up, have various problems with this target group, including language prob-
lems, administrative problems (because the victims initially often have no papers), the un-
suitability of the approach (which is often future-oriented, due to the uncertain residence 
status of the victims), and the high security risk.NRM3 The problems with capacity in the shel-
ters also take up a lot of police time because they generally transport victims to the shelter. 
They also have to interview them at these shelters, which are sometimes a very long distance 
away since it is not always possible to find a shelter in the region where the investigation is 
taking place, although an effort is made to do so.131

Specific problems concerning victims of other forms of exploitation
Specific problems – characteristic of this group – arise in providing shelter for victims of other 
forms of exploitation. First, where there is a suspicion of another form of exploitation the situ-
ation often involves a relatively large number of (possible) victims. For example, in the case 
‘Exploitation on an asparagus farm in Someren’132 55 possible victims of human trafficking 
were found. There would have been practical problems in quickly finding adequate shelter for 
all of these victims.
Unlike victims of sexual exploitation, victims of other forms of exploitation are usually male, 
and there are few places in shelters for male victims. Furthermore, it is conceivable that victims 
of other forms of exploitation require a different type of shelter and counselling than victims 
of sexual exploitation.
The following case illustrates the difficulty of finding a good shelter:133

Following a search of a dwelling in which 11 Indonesians were found living under dreadful con-
ditions, the Social Intelligence and Investigation Service (SIOD) immediately looked for places 
in a reception facility for the four victims who wished to avail themselves of their rights under 
the B9 regulation. However, because CoMensha could not find a place for the four (potential) 

130 E-mail from Royal Dutch Marechaussee to BNRM.
131 As a rule, shelter will be sought within the relevant police region during the reflection period in the interests 

of the investgation (B9 regulation, §3.2.7).
132 For a detailed description of this case, see §12.2.
133 This case is described in §12.2.

NMR Ch04.indd   141 09-06-10   00:05



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

142

victims of other forms of exploitation, the SIOD felt compelled to arrange accommodation for 
them itself in hotels, and later in a holiday home. After more than a week, CoMensha was able 
to find a place in a reception facility. Remarkably, this reception facility was two streets away 
from the place where the victims had worked and been exploited, and consequently they found 
themselves in a place where they felt unsafe.

Care coordinators
The care coordinator provides oversight in the chain of care providers and other partners 
and also tries to arrange suitable care and shelter. Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implemen-
tation Guidelines 2000 (see Chapter 5) states that a care coordinator will ensure that the 
victim is properly informed about the legal consequences of reporting a crime or otherwise 
cooperating with a criminal investigation or prosecution.
In its progress report, published on 9 September 2009, the Human Trafficking Task Force 
called on municipalities to encourage the appointment of a care coordinator in every region 
as part of their duty of care towards victims of human trafficking, According to the progress 
report, the care coordinator has a clear overview of what is happening in relation to victims 
in the region and so can play a pivotal role in ensuring the effective delivery of data to Co-
Mensha.

A study by Klein134 into the police and chain partners showed that the regions of IJsselland and 
Twente wanted to introduce a care coordinator for human trafficking. In IJsselland, the police 
force’s expert in human trafficking said that there are few facilities for women who do not want 
shelter but do want help. Shelter for victims in this region is arranged through CoMensha. A 
care coordinator could be involved in arranging shelter, but would also have access to a net-
work of specialist social workers. In the Twente region, the police work with CoMensha and 
local social workers or shelters in specific cases. The regional police force’s expert in human 
trafficking also said that it is not easy for the police to provide shelter for every victim they find. 
A care coordinator could serve as a sort of one-stop shop. Money has already been earmarked 
for a care coordinator in Twente. The tasks of the care coordinator will include coordinating 
assistance, referring victims to agencies such as legal aid, providing information and advice, 
building a network and coordinating and complementing the supply of help. The Kennemer-
land region also wants to appoint a care coordinator; according to the interview this region has 
no shelter for victims of human trafficking.

A care coordinator could be part of a chain approach to human trafficking in the region. 
For example, the ACM in Amsterdam functions as a care coordinator. In 2007, on the basis 
of the ACM’s experiences, CoMensha wrote a handbook on the chain approach to human 
trafficking,135 including best practices. This can be used to develop a joint approach at the lo-
cal level. Other recommendations include providing clear information to victims of human 
trafficking, the use of a permanent coordinator for each victim (in many cases the care coor-

dinator), the use of a client file, a single contact point for clients and partners (for example, 
in the form of a website or office, preferably connected to the Support Centre for Domestic 
Violence and Reporting Centres for Child Abuse), close monitoring of cases, and sharing 
and learning from existing knowledge.

4.6.2 	 Categorical	shelter

Social services, the police and policymakers have agreed for some time that a first-line cat-
egorical shelter for victims,136 where every victim could go and which could offer expert help 
and counselling, would solve a lot of problems. Registration should be done centrally and 
should be possible at any time of the day or night. During this initial period, victims could 
rest and their needs could be assessed. There would also be time to decide how best to ad-
dress their needs later (arrange a move to another shelter, set them up to live more independ-
ently or perhaps help them to return to their country of origin). The victims would also be 
able to consult social workers and the police, or even a lawyer, in a safe environment. It is ap-
parent that it is essential to arrange proper facilities that victims could move on to in order to 
guarantee access to the low-threshold initial shelter. Although there is broad agreement on 
what is needed, the need for consultation between the various ministries on the financing of 
categorical shelter has delayed its implementation.137

Measure five of the Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan addresses the issue of shel-
ter for victims. The plan states that the State Secretaries for Justice and for Health, Welfare 
and Sport are organising a pilot project to “investigate whether victims of human traffick-
ing can be accommodated safely and how this can be permanently organised. In this pilot 
project [they] … will be sheltered by social workers with specific knowledge of this group. 
Besides this counselling, they will also be offered the necessary rest and safety. This should 
help victims as they consider whether or not to report the crime or cooperate with a criminal 
investigation against human traffickers. The pilot project will be carried out by a municipal-
ity. The greatest possible use will be made of existing facilities and networks.” This is in 
line with a number of conclusions reached by a meeting of experts on categorical shelter 
for victims of human trafficking held on 21 May 2008, which was attended by BNRM and 
a number of other experts, including employees of the Ministry of Justice and CoMensha. 
Participants at this meeting expressed the view that the current centres of expertise should 
jointly develop a methodology and that the accommodations should have specialists who 
should be able to discuss the issue of repatriation, who must be able to provide psychosocial 
and psychiatric help, who should be multicultural and multilingual and who should be part 
of a network of agencies that cooperate and share information.

136 For a period of at least three months, according to one of the conclusions of BNRM expert meeting on cat-
egorical shelter for victims of human trafficking, capacity and methodology working group, 21 May 2008.

137 During the expert meeting on 21 May 2008 it was estimated that shelter would be needed for 200 victims an-
nually (that means 50 places per quarter) and that it must be possible to adapt this number to the number of 
victims requiring shelter. The cost per place would be €40,000 for ‘bed, bath, bread, security’ plus the staff 
costs for certified social workers and any special expertise that is required.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

144

During a plenary debate in parliament on 10 June 2009, the State Secretary for Justice said 
that the tender process for the project would commence shortly and that the first places 
should become available around September 2009 (although this deadline could not be met).138 
There would initially be 50 new places in shelters. The target group of the pilot scheme was 
described in the progress report on the Human Trafficking Task Force’s Action Plan of 9 
September 2009. In principle, the pilot project would encompass all victims: women, men, 
any accompanying children and, if necessary, minors, whether they are Dutch or of another 
nationality. Minors are not, however, regarded as the primary target group. This is apparent, 
for example, from the fact that the tender for the project relates primarily to adult victims 
and does not cover areas that are essential for the care of minors.139 With regard to minors, 
the report notes that where the need for shelter is indicated, they (and particularly girls who 
are victims of loverboys) fall under youth care, and it refers to the pilot scheme for protected 
shelter for unaccompanied underage aliens. The fact that minors identified as needing shelter 
are covered by youth care does not negate the need for shelters (closed or open) in the youth 
care system specifically for this vulnerable group. It is still uncertain whether a distinction 
will be made in terms of age, gender and nationality in the facilities for categorical shelter.
Categorical shelter does not mean that general principles relating to help and shelter can 
be set aside. For minors, attention must be given to creating a pedagogical climate and pro-
viding education140. Experience in shelters for women and girls has also shown that mixed 
groups are less suitable for these victims141.

Protected shelter
The pilot scheme, Protected Shelter for Unaccompanied Underage Aliens, was launched on 
1 January 2008 to combat the disappearance of unaccompanied underage aliens from open 
reception centres142. The project was to run for two years and was targeted at unaccompa-
nied underage aliens aged between 13 and 18 who are suspected of being potential victims of 
human trafficking and are consequently at risk of disappearing from the shelter. In consulta-
tion with relevant partners, the IND’s Human Smuggling Information Group (MIG) draws 
up risk profiles, which are used to select the underage aliens at risk.143 The pilot project is 
intended to protect the youths and prevent them, as far as possible, from disappearing from 
the shelter and ending up in situations of exploitation. The shelters are small in scale,144 with 
intensive supervision and the youngsters must have permission to leave the shelter, and are 
escorted if neccessary. Additional security measures include camera surveillance, the use

lum seekers, has been working with chain partners on protected shelter since 2006.

of security guards and firm understandings with external partners. While they are staying 
in the shelter, an effort is made to convince the underage aliens that they face major risks if 
they follow any instructions they may have received from the human traffickers before they 
departed. Whether they qualify for a residence permit and whether a criminal investigation 
can be launched is investigated. If no residence permit can be granted, preparations are made 
for the child’s repatriation. The Central Reception Agency for Asylum Seekers (COA) is 
responsible for organising the protected shelter and developing the system’s methodology145; 
the arrangements are implemented by contract partners.146

The methodology147

The methodology has to take account of some specific characteristics of the residents:
 – there are major cultural, religious and social differences and large differences between boys 

and girls;
 – many young people have a poor self-image and little self-confidence;
 – some girls display sexualised behaviour as a result of experiences during the journey;
 – there is a relatively large number of pregnancies – often caused by rapes during the journey 

– and, conseuquently, very young mothers;
 – there are many physical complaints, frequent feelings of rage, sadness, shame and powerless-

ness and there is a high level of stress and tension.
In developing the methodology, the following information was used: factors that are effective 
in social services (the what works principles); literature about target groups with closely related 
problems, such as victims of loverboys; and various theoretical perspectives. The programme 
has two phases: Phase 1, Motivation and protection (eight to 12 weeks) and Phase 2, Growth 
to freedom (a minimum of eight weeks). For each phase, there is a description of the tasks and 
roles of the mentor, what protection will be provided, the cooperation with the guardian and 
the final objectives. Criteria for phase 1 include the following: the young person should have 
a relationship of trust with at least one adult and should have reported the crime (or it has 
become clear why no reporting was done). In phase 2, it is expected that the young people can 
handle the freedom given to them in a responsible manner, are sufficiently resilient and have 
decided what they want for the future. A third, and, possisbly a fourth phase, were originally 
planned, but have not yet been implemented.

Nidos has legal guardianship over the young people,148 monitors their supervision and re-
ports any children who go missing. The police are responsible for investigating any disap-

147 Based on the draft version of the methodology, 12 June 2009. Incidentally, it is noteworthy, to say the least, 

that eighteen months after the system had been in operation, and six months before the end of the pilot 
project, the methodology had still not been finalised, and training courses based on the methodology were 
only due to start in the autumn. 

148 Guardianship can be arranged within 24 hours for young people at risk. According to Nidos’ annual report 
for 2008, an important justification for placing a youth in a protected shelter is when an investigation is 
underway into human trafficking and the young person admits that it has occurred. Nidos also observes that 
the young people should be placed in an open setting as soon as possible, and this is increasingly possible 
because victims are less “bound” to the traffickers than in the past. This could be, for example, because they 
have already been sold ot another trafficker on the way to the Netherlands.

pearances. The protocol for missing unaccompanied underage asylum seekers, which has 
been in place for some time but was not familiar to all the relevant partners and was not fol-
lowed in the past,NRM5 is being used again, in modified form. A clear step-by-step plan for the 
response to the disappearance of an unaccompanied underage alien was drawn up and im-
plemented in the regions where the pilot project is running. There are plans to incorporate 
this abridged protocol in the KLPD’s national manual on missing persons.149

The EMM centrally processes all reports of relevant behaviour so that possible abuse can 
be identified early on. It also makes proposals for criminal investigations. The IND strives 
to make a decision on a request for asylum within three months,150 and the Repatriation and 
Departure Service (DT&V) has the task of arranging the departure from the Netherlands of 
any minors who have no prospect of remaining legally in the country. Alternative shelter is 
sought for young people who have been sold by their families. The IOM helps anyone who 
chooses to leave independently. On the basis of figures for arrivals of so-called at-risk unac-
companied underage aliens in the first six months of 2006, the size of the target group was 
estimated at 80 persons a year. Most of the young people who arrived in that period were 
from Nigeria and India. On 4 November 2008, parliament was informed about progress 
with the pilot project. The report mentioned that the young people are under 24-hour super-
vision during their first three months in the shelter and that counselling is mainly concen-
trated on increasing their knowledge, skills and resilience and offering them the prospect of 
an alternative future.

Progress report and Report on Aliens Chain
According to the progress report in November 2008, from the start of the pilot scheme until 
the end of 2008 approximately 120 young people had been given shelter. Three young people 
had returned to their country of origin independently with the help of the IOM and one had 
been forcibly deported after reaching the age of 18. Apart from Nigeria and India, other coun-
tries of origin included China, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Guinea and Angola. During this period 
18 young people disappeared from the shelter: 11 boys from India, five youths from China (three 
boys and two girls), one girl from Nigeria and one girl from Sierra Leone. Additional security 
measures were then taken and the police and Marechaussee intensified their superivsion. All in 
all, there was a steep decline in the number of girls from Nigeria, a large number of whom had 
disappeared in the same period (January-October) in both 2006 and 2007. During that same 
period, 33 Indian boys disappeared in 2006 and 28 in 2007. It should be noted that the number 
of arrivals in this period was higher.
Finally, the progress report mentions two Indian boys who were found in France after they 
had disappeared and an international alert had been issued. A request was then made to have 
them returned to the Netherlands, which France granted. Before the deadline for their return

150 The stautory period of six months for deciding applies, but the IND’s proposal that decisions will in princi-

ple be made within three months is based on the interests of the unaccompanied underage asylum seekers 
– to let them know for certain what their prospects for staying in the Netherlands are as soon as possible. 
Social workers responded to this with the criticism (expressed at meetings of the unaccompanied underage 
asylum seeker platform and elsewhere) that it is impossible to win the trust of the unaccompanied underage 
asylu seeker or discover the true story when there is time pressure.

and before the Netherlands could make all the preparation to have them handed over, a French 
court ordered that the boys be released from custody. The Indian boys were then able to evade 
supervision in France. This type of problem calls for a joint European approach to prevent 
children like this from again finding themselves in a situation of exploitation.

Conversations with the staff of shelters also show that many of the girls entering the shelters 
are pregnant, a situation that calls for a specific approach at these locations.
Confinement is an important element of protected shelter but, at the same time, the restric-
tion of the freedom of movement of the young people is a cause for some concern,151 even 
though it is in their own interests. It should be noted here that this restriction of movement 
does not mean that the shelters have to be regarded as closed youth care. Lawyers have ex-
pressed some criticism about the placement of these children in shelters without authorisa-
tion by the children’s court,152 but it is the guardian who places the young people there.153

The WODC will make a final evaluation of the protected shelter pilot scheme, when it will 
also analyse whether there has been a decline in the number of disappearances by unaccom-
panied underage aliens.

4.6.3	 Closed	youth	care

General
Providing shelter and treatment for underage victims of sexual exploitation is complex. 
Some girls find it so difficult to prise themselves loose of a loverboy that they frequently run 
away from the shelter and refuse any help. Unfortunately, admission to a closed facility is 
then inevitable.154 Naturally, the main priority is that admission to the shelter is never a goal 
in itself but, under certain circumstances, can be the least bad option. From that perspec-
tive, the question is how to provide the best shelter and treatment for this group within the 
constraints of confinement. Key to this is that the shelters must be small in scale, must be 
exclusively for girls and must offer protection. The need to find and apply alternatives to 
simply locking up this group of girls has already been mentioned in NRM5, and that need 
still exists.

There is no reason to exclude the group of girls for whom closed shelter is inevitable from the 
exploration of categorical shelter in the pilot project. The point is to investigate how shelter 
and care can be designed to fit the needs of each distinct group of victims within a complete 
range of open and closed facilities. As mentioned above, one of the options, particularly for 

151 See, among others, Boermans (2008).
152 Lawyers have also remarked that the Youth Care Inspectorate should also exercise supervision in light of the 

restriction of freedom.
153 For the group for whom this is a very serious problem, there is access to closed youth care. According to the 

Youth Care Implemeenting Decree, underage aliens who are not living in the country legally are also entitled 
help, residence and observation diagnostics. For closed youth care, authorisation by the children’s court is 
required.

underage victims, must be closed shelters. This research can incorporate the experience that 
has already been gained with facilities for specific categories of victims, such as the Asja and 
MEISSA facilities described earlier, and in the protected shelter pilot project. In this con-
text, it is important that minors are also a target group of the pilot project, including girls for 
whom admission to a closed facility is the most appropriate solution.

A youth care indication is required for admission of a child to a closed facility. There is also 
an indication for ‘open’ youth care. The Minister for Youth and Family is responsible for 
youth care. According to the progress report,155 the Minister for Youth and Family is prima-
rily concerned with prevention. That is very important and there many projects in that area 
(see §4.6.4). It is evident, however, that prevention alone is insufficient. It is therefore also 
necessary to create national and categorical shelter within the system of residential or non-
residential youth facilities and to establish sufficient capacity and specific approaches for 
dealing with these populations.156

Youth Care Act
On 1 January 2008, the Youth Care Act was amended (in theory, effectively splitting youth 
care up between those who are placed in care under criminal law and those who are placed 
under civil law). There had been a lot of criticism of placing minors admitted under a ‘civil au-
thorisation’ together in the same facility with minors who were placed there on the grounds 
of criminal behaviour, as a punishment or sanction, or who are in provisional custody.157 All 
minors placed in a facility under a civil authorisation are due to be transferred from the Ju-
venile Custodial Institutions (JCIs) to accommodations for closed youth care by 1 January 
2010. To this end, eight JCIs will be transformed into closed youth care accommodations 
between 2008 and 2010. After 1 January 2010, a number of JCIs will also be temporarily des-
ignated as closed youth care accommodations. And from 1 August 2009, young people with 
a court authorisation for closed youth care can only be registered and admitted to closed 
youth care accommodation. This transition period is intended to allow time to create the 
necessary capacity.

Capacity
As the Minister for Youth and Family stated in his letter to the Lower House of Parliament 
on 7 July 2009, the number of places available is not automatically the same as the number 
of places needed for closed youth care. It is unclear what this will mean for (possible) victims 

155 Human Trafficking Task Force, (2009b).
156 Initiatives include those of Fier Fryslân in Leeuwarden and the Hoenderloo Group in Apeldoorn, which have 

devised plans to form a partnership with the aim of creating specialist youth care specifically for victims of 
loverboys (written information from Fier Fryslân) and Cardea Jeugdzorg in Alphen aan de Rijn, which is 
looking for accommodation for shelter specifically for teenage mothers and victims of loverboys (AD, 15 
September 2009). 

157 The Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Hammerberg also criticised joint placement (in 
his report of 5 January 2009), an important factor being that both a victim of human trafficking and the hu-
man trafficker concerned could be admitted to the same establishment.

of loverboys. The current facilities (with no treatment) for girls have 114 places.158 For years a 
major problem has been the transfer to establishments for treatment, closed or open.
The Minister for Youth and Family wants to greatly shorten the average period of treatment 
for young people.159 There is also no distinction made between shelters and establishments 
for treatment in the case of closed youth care,160 which could be an advantage and should in 
any case prevent or reduce problems caused by not enough young people moving on to other 
facilities. On the other hand, there is the risk that there will be no facilities for victims of lov-
erboys to be placed because there is no capacity. It is not clear whether there will be specific 
places for treatment of (possible) victims of loverboys in closed youth care or whether it will 
take a different form: mixed accommodations, mixed accommodations with groups of girls 
and boys or accommodations specifically for this group (categorical), nor is it clear what 
method of treatment will be adopted.

Methodology
The Human Trafficking Task Force’s progress report of 9 September 2009161 stated that the 
Minister for Youth and Family is responsible for preventing and combating the problem of 
underage victims of loverboys and that there are programmes in youth care ‘to make girls 
who are susceptible to loverboys more capable of resisting bad influences’. As described later 
in this chapter, there are many different projects to address the loverboy problem. Never-
theless, providing shelter and residential care for these girls is unfortunately still an urgent 
problem and it is important to develop a methodology for it, particularly in closed youth 
care. There is currently no specific method of treatment for this group in the reception phase 
in the JCIs.162 On this point, the progress report states that ‘in the context of the quality of 
closed youth care, it is proposed that the treatment of young people in a closed youth care 
institution should be tailored to their individual problems.’ This says nothing about specific 
treatment for victims of loverboys.

Supervision
The situation with the target group of minors currently placed in the JCIs under civil law 
is often not straightforward. The Youth Care Inspectorate carries out initial assessments 
of the institutions that will provide closed youth care, with the exception of former JCIs. 
There is some concern about whether the institutions for closed youth care are immediately 
capable of providing the necessary care for victims of loverboys, who are difficult to protect 
and treat.

Closed Youth Care in Haaglanden
The Inspectorate’s report on the initial assessment for Haaglanden refers to a site that is so 
open that the people inside are able to communicate with other youths hanging around the 
site and contraband can be passed through the fences to the youngsters, that young people can 
visit each other’s rooms in the evening and that loverboys have also been seen around the site. 
Youths had also run away 63 times in the period from May 2008 to October 2008, which was 
very easy to do because the fences around the site were low.35163 In this case, the Inspectorate 
observed that “the young people at the JIC face a great risk of becoming involved in incidents 
that harm them or in which they harm others. There is also a great risk that the young people 
will run away. The fact that outsiders, including loverboys, who do not have the best of inten-
tions towards the young people, hang around near the building makes this even more disturb-
ing.” Admission to closed youth care is a measure designed to protect the young people from 
themselves, particularly victims of loverboys, and such signs are very disturbing. Following this 
initial assessment, the JIC took various measures to guarantee the safety of the young people 
and the Inspectorate placed the JIC under stricter supervision. The Inspectorate will carry out 
a further assessment within a year, based on the same criteria as the initial assessment so that 
the results can be compared.

18 to 21164

Figures from the Custodial Institutions Agency (DJI) show that on 7 July 2009, young peo-
ple with a court authorisation for closed youth care spent an average of just over four months 
in a JCI shelter and almost a year in a JCI treatment centre.165 Closed youth care should, 
in principle, be possible for young people up to the age of 21;166 however, it is questionable 
whether this is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. According 
to Article 5 of the Convention, minors may only be placed in a closed facility for the pur-
pose of educational supervision. The legislature had the following remark to make about 
the possible incompatibility of Article 29a, section 1 of the Youth Care Act with Article 
5 of the European Convention on Human Rights: “Adopting a flexible approach may be 
necessary, particularly in the context of youth care. In the case of youth care, reaching the 
age of majority does not by definition mean that there is no longer a need or possibility 
for education. After all, parents do not immediately stop raising their children when they 
become adults. […] In connection with the requirement of proportionality, it is very im-
portant to note here that stretching the rules in this way applies only in so far as it concerns 
continuation of mandatory youth care that commenced before the general age of majority 
was reached and where there are still serious problems in growing up and in education 
that seriously hamper the youth’s development to adulthood, which still necessitate closed 
care. In other words, these are cumulative requirements. […] The choice of the age of 21 
is based on the experience that effective treatment is completed within a small number of

years. By making it possible to continue closed youth care until the youth is 21, if a 17-year-
old is admitted, a programme of at least three years can still be completed. By extension, 
the youth can be offered additional care, which is an entitlement under the Youth Care Act, 
on a voluntary basis until he is 23.”167

The Council of State has also questioned the compatibility of Article 29a of the Youth Care 
Act with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Meanwhile, the line has 
been taken in case law that closed youth care for over-18s is possible under certain conditions 
if there are special circumstances while the youth is already being treated and if the youth is 
transferred to a different shelter (for example a psychiatric institution).168

4.6.4 Ambulant help

Exit programme for prostitutes
The Ministry of Justice has an exit scheme for prostitutes. The recently launched Exit Pro-
gramme for Prostitutes (Regeling Uitstapprogramma’s Prostitutuees) is, in principle, open to 
all prostitutes (male or female) and therefore also to prostitutes from other countries, such 
as Bulgaria and Romania who have arrived in the Netherlands as victims of human traffick-
ing. When a prostitute decides to stop, the implementing organisation and the individual 
concerned sign a contract containing binding agreements on such aspects as the effort the 
prostitute is required to make, the objectives to be achieved (which can also be to return 
to the country of origin), lifestyle (the use of medications and drugs, for example) and the 
structure of the programme.169 If the former prostitute is likely to return to his or her own 
country, the aid agencies agree on how he or she can best prepare for the return and what 
knowledge and skills can be improved. According to the state secretary’s letter, participa-
tion in the programme is not intended to help the individual’s integration into Dutch so-
ciety, which should in fact depend on the type of residence permit the individual holds. If 
the person has been granted permanent residence or continued residence, the skills that are 
strengthened should be those that promote integration into Dutch society.

Loverboy projects
The fifth report of the NRM mentioned that various municipalities had projects relating to 
loverboys. It mentioned a number of examples, and described the loverboy project in Zwolle 
in more detail. At BNRM’s request, Garnier170 conducted a survey of projects by munici-
palities and others aimed at preventing the loverboy problem for her Master’s thesis. She 
identified a total of 37 projects in the Netherlands, most of them concerned with publicising 
the problem (33), providing help (20) and increasing expertise (19). A small number were

dedicated to investigating and prosecuting offenders. The target groups were ‘girls at risk’ 
(37), schools (31), victims (29), parents (18), teachers (16), experts (17) and in a small number 
of projects, offenders (11) or ‘boys at risk’. In most projects there were several partners in-
volved, including municipalities (22), municipal health services (20), schools (20), the Youth 
Care Agency (19) and the police (18). Organisations that were less frequently involved in-
cluded the public prosecution service (7), the youth information centre JIP (6), the Child 
Protection Council (6) or other agencies, such as the MEE. Since little was known about 
prevention targeted at offenders, Garnier devoted special attention to five of those projects 
(see Garnier (2009) for descriptions of the five projects): the Leerstraf Seksualiteit (Rutgers 
Nisso Group), On Track Again (Zwolle), the Project Beeldvorming (a theatre performance 
by Stichting Meerwaarde), the Stedelijk Mobiel Jongeren Team (The Hague) and the only 
project specifically targeted at potential loverboys, the Task Force Approach to Loverboys 
(Eindhoven).

Perspective approach to (former)unaccompanied underage aliens
The Perspective approach developed in Utrecht for (former) unaccompanied underage al-
iens reported on in the NRM’s fifth report has received wide support. Various municipali-
ties have adopted a similar approach and the Lower House of Parliament adopted a motion 
calling for government support for a two-year national experiment with support centres for 
unaccompanied underage aliens in 15 municipalities.171 In a home-like environment, the un-
accompanied underage aliens receive legal advice, practical help and information, as well as 
assistance in making decisions about their future. The options offered are either to return 
to their country of origin or apply for a residence permit. In July 2009, the State Secretary 
for Justice said that a steering group, consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Justice 
and the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG), had been set up to implement the 
motion. The municipal support centres that will take part in the experiment have still to be 
selected. The experiment was expected to start on 1 October 2009.172 Meanwhile, the pro-
posed length of the project has been shortened to 18 months because of cost considerations; 

171 Extract from this motion by MP Spekman, which was adopted on 3 July 2008: “considering that 15 munici-
palities have successfully adopted a method with respect to (former) unaccompanied underage aliens, the 
so-called ‘Perspective Support Centre appproach’, which can be effectively implemented and has proved hu-
mane (since this approach has led to an increase in the return of former unaccompanied aliens to the country 
of origin, a group of them was granted a residence permit and this group is prevented from being forced to 
live here illegally), requests the government, in consultation with the relevant municipalities to start an ex-
periment for two years guided by the principles of the Perspective Support Centre approach and to evaluate 
the effect of this experiment in increasing the percentage of former unaccompanied underage aliens who 
actually return and reducing the percentage of former unaccompanied underage aliens whose whereabouts 
are unknown”.

the budget allows for participation by 10 regions. The plans call for the WODC to evaluate 
the approach in 2010.

Repatriation
When foreign victims of human trafficking do not receive a residence permit they are re-
quired to return to their country of origin. Some victims choose to return voluntarily, in 
which case their actual return is arranged by IOM Nederland on the basis of the Return 
and Emigration of Aliens from the Netherlands (REAN) scheme. The IOM arranges a plane 
ticket, assistance at the airport at the time of departure and, possibly, on arrival, and some-
times a financial subsidy. For victims of human trafficking it is not always enough to organise 
the trip; the assistance provided must be tailored to take into account the vulnerable position 
and individual needs of the individual concerned and the safety of the victim, the victim’s 
family and the social workers concerned. If necessary, IOM Nederland can, in association 
with BLinN and CoMensha, mediate in finding accommodation and can help with the vic-
tim’s reintegration in the country of origin. Since 2008, IOM Nederland has been involved 
in setting up referral mechanisms in Benin and Lagos in Nigeria. The IOM coordinates the 
Dutch input to this project, which is called ‘Counter Trafficking Initiative: analysis of the ev-
olution of trafficking in persons, grass root social intervention, building social services and 
networking capacity and promoting direct assistance’. Having started on 1 October 2008, 
the project is designed to identify all the social services and NGOs and make agreements 
with them to provide care for victims, whether they are identified locally or have returned 
from Western countries.
The Netherlands also finances projects in Bulgaria and Romania to help these countries to 
create more and better structures for providing shelter.173 In 2007, 29 victims (including two 
underage girls and one underage boy) returned to their country of origin under the REAN 
programme. The countries concerned were Bulgaria (10), Hungary (7) and Romania, Brazil, 
Nigeria, Poland, Sierra Leone, Lithuania and Syria (one each). The IOM is also active in 
ensuring the safe return of unaccompanied underage aliens. In 2007, 21 left (with the writ-
ten agreement of the guardian), of whom 13 returned to Angola as part of the IOM project 
‘Return and reintegration of Angolan unaccompanied minor asylum seekers from the Neth-
erlands’174. No unaccompanied underage asylum seekers returned under a similar project for 
the Democratic Republic of Congo in that year.175

The IOM arranged the return of 37 victims of human trafficking in 2008. Twelve of them 
came from Hungary, 8 from Bulgaria, 6 from Romania and 12 from other countries. Besides 
the assistance it provides as part of the REAN programme, it can also provide other forms of 
assistance with respect to reintegration, such as language courses, temporary accommoda-
tion or providing an escort for the journey to the final destination. Five of the victims who

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

154

 
Kersten (2009) conducted research into the process of remigration and reintegration of Bul-
garian women who had been exploited in the prostitution sector in the Netherlands over the 
period 2003 to 2006. An important finding from the study of their files was that 36% (29) of the 
81 women who returned voluntarily or were deported returned again to the Netherlands, ac-
cording to CoMensha and IND data. The process of return and the remigration was therefore 
unsuccessful for a significant number of these women. Kersten describes repatriation as a tem-
porary phase in the migration process. Some of the women were also repeat victims. The study 
produced little certainty about the risks of return and the dangers the women actually faced 
after their return. The files studied provide little or no indication of whether the risks were 
identified prior to their return, which is a requirement for repatriation. Furthermore, there 
was scarcely any feedback of information to the Netherlands after their return about problems 
that might have arisen after their return. Social services in Bulgaria generally seemed to know 
little about the group because the women went their own way. Because most of the women did 
not come from urban areas, they had to rely on themselves. It is therefore generally not known 
whether the women caused problems for themselves or their families because of the criminal 
network that might still have had them in their sights. The situation of the women that initially 
made them vulnerable to exploitation scarcely seems to have altered after their return. The 
victims often seem to have returned to problematic family relationships characterised by abuse 
and violence. The relevant social workers therefore felt there was little chance of reintegration 
for many of them after their return.
Kersten describes how the factors that lead to a woman falling into a situation of exploitation 
mean that the chance of her reintegration after returning is small. What the women have ex-
perienced often makes it even more difficult to settle after their return. There are macro fac-
tors underlying many of the problems at the root of human trafficking, and which again play a 
role on the women’s return, such as their subordination, discrimination in the labour market, 
for example, unemployment, poverty and a lack of future prospects. These factors are heavily 
related to the political, cultural and economic changes in Bulgaria since the fall of commu-
nism and mean that the chances for women who have returned are just as limited as they were 
before they ended up in prostitution in the Netherlands. Organised crime in Bulgaria, which 
has grown strongly with the political and economic instability during the transition, is also an 
important factor. Human traffickers are happy to exploit women who are looking for a better 
future and will then not easily allow this source of income to go. In the face of threats or out 
of financial necessity, these victims regularly choose themselves to return to their trafficker. It 
is known that some women even actively cooperate in recruiting and exploiting other women, 
after they themselves have been exploited in prostitution.176 The contacts with traffickers and 
pimps does not, in any case, end on their return and there is still a risk of exploitation, says Ker-
sten. Accordingly, the problems connected with the human trafficking are beyond the reach of 
the Netherlands after the victims return to Bulgaria, but the problems are usually not resolved 
and the women often return to the Netherlands as repeat victims.
The position of victims of human trafficking who return to the country of origin is a subject 
that requires further attention and a greater effort. The finding from Kerstens’ study highlight 
a lack of knowledge about the situation of women when they return to their country, their lack 
of prospects on their return and the problems surrounding remigration.

4.7 Incidental problems of victims

4.7.1	 The	health	of	victims	of	human	trafficking

Being a victim can have serious consequences for the health of the individuals concerned. 
People who move around under risky and exploitative conditions face an increased risk of 
contracting HIV/AIDS,177 for example. In 2006, Zimmerman published a study on the phys-
ical and psychological consequences of human trafficking for victims in Europe.

 
Zimmerman’s study (carried out between 2003 and 2004) focused on women who were forced 
to work in the sex industry or women who were sexually abused while performing household 
work and who had entered a reintegration programme. He interviewed 207 women. The vic-
tims were interviewed at different stages of the care programme, after between zero and 14 
days, after a few weeks (28-56 days) and after more than three months (90+ days), covering 
three phases of the treatment programme and looking at the medical complaints present at 
each of these stages. Sixty-one percent of the women had been free of the situation of exploita-
tion for less than three months before the treatment started. The most striking fact shown by 
the study is that the number of health problems quickly declined. The interviewees were asked 
to what extent they experienced a number of complaints. In the first phase, 57% had 12 or more 
physical symptoms that caused them pain or discomfort and 43% had between none and 11 
symptoms. In the second phase, 7% of the victims had 12-23 symptoms and 93% between none 
and 11. In the final phase, the number of women in the high segment of symptoms fell to 6%. 
As regards the number of mental health symptoms, 71% suffered from 10 to 17 complaints in 
the first phase and 29% had zero to 9 complaints. In the subsequent phases, the percentage that 
mentioned having 10 to 17 complaints fell to 52% and then 6%.
17% of the women in the study said they had had at least one abortion during the period cov-
ered. It is not known whether they did so under coercion.
A significant finding is that in the first two weeks 63% of the victims had problems with their 
memory, which subsequently improved. The number of victims with Post Traumatic Stress 
Syndrome (PTSS) also fell in that period (from 56% to 12%). This is important information 
for the police who often have to interview victims immediately and want to collect evidence 
promptly. However, the most apropriate moment to interview victims to gather evidence has 
not yet been established.
There were also extreme symptoms of depression, anxiety and hostility. In the first phase of 
the programme, the scores were similar to those of the top 10% of the entire population. Only 
after more than 90 days did the anxiety and hostility decline in relative terms, but the score on 
depression remained close to that of the top 10% of the entire population, which would make 
it difficult for these women to participate again in daily life, to work or to follow an education. 
This factor must be therefore be taken into account in the treatment programme for victims, 
as well as the time needed to treat it.

4.7.2	 Collateral	damage

The Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women (GAATW) has conducted research into 
the impact on human rights of measures to combat human trafficking.178 The study covered 
Australia, (the former) Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, India, Nigeria, Thailand, the United 
Kingdom and the United States. The reason for the study was the suspicion that measures 
that are taken to combat human trafficking sometimes actually restrict the possibilities 
and the rights of the people the measures are intended to protect, by curtailing freedom 
of movement and the right to work, for example. GAATW stressed the importance of the 
proportionality of measures and called for more attention to investigating and ending forced 
labour, rather than preventing recruitment. On this point, see also Chapter 3, International 
developments, §3.3.5.

4.8	 Conclusion

In this concluding section the emphasis is laid on the problems and the points requiring at-
tention that were raised in this chapter.

Shelter
There is insufficient capacity to provide shelter for victims, and not just for specific catego-
ries of victims of human trafficking, such as men (usually victims of other forms of exploita-
tion), minors and victims with specific problems such as psychiatric problems or addictions. 
Even female victims of exploitation in the sex industry cannot always be given shelter imme-
diately. The waiting time can range from several days to weeks and even to several months.
Everyone concerned agrees in principle on the importance of initial shelter specially tailored 
to the specific circumstances of the different groups of victims. The Human Trafficking Task 
Force’s action plan proposed a pilot project, which was unfortunately delayed. The progress 
report on the Task Force’s action plan of 9 September 2009 stated that the pilot project is 
in principle intended for all victims: women, men, any accompanying children and minors, 
whether they are of Dutch or foreign nationality. That leaves open the question of whether 
a distinction will be made between genders and between the different age groups in the fa-
cilities for categorical shelter. Categorical shelter, in and of itself, does not mean that this 
distinction will no longer be made in the shelter. However, minors are not regarded as the 
primary target group of the pilot project. This is apparent, for example, from the fact that 
the tender for the project primarily relates to adult victims and does not cover issues that are 
essential in providing shelter for minors, such as education and a pedagogical climate.
The purpose of the project is, in fact, to determine how a system of shelter and care can 
be designed for each individual group of victims (specifically including closed or protected 
facilities for underage victims) within an overall system of open and closed facilities. The

project can incorporate the experience that has already been gained with categorical facili-
ties and in the Secured Care pilot project. It is important in this context that the pilot project 
should also explicitly embrace underage victims, including girls for whom shelter in a closed 
or protected facility is most appropriate. Incidentally, it is unclear why agreement between 
the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport is required for under-
age victims. Primary responsibility for them would seem to rest with the Minister for Youth 
and Family. Another aspect requiring attention is the capacity, or lack of it, for closed youth 
care, partly as a result of the transformation of JCIs into facilities for closed youth care.
In January 2008, the two-year Protected Shelter pilot scheme started. The pilot project rep-
resents an attempt to provide protection for underage aliens who might be at risk of disap-
pearing and being exploited. This is also a small-scale shelter.
There is also a trend towards the creation of private shelters, particularly for underage vic-
tims of human trafficking. There are risks to these initiatives, however praiseworthy they 
may be. Providing shelter demands specific expertise and a professional context. Lack of 
such expertise could cause additional harm to the members of this target group.

Special risk groups
This chapter discussed several groups who face particular risks of becoming victims of hu-
man trafficking, including women in the La Strada countries, women and girls in asylum 
centres and people with slight mental handicaps.
Special attention has also been devoted to Roma children. It is not easy to respond adequate-
ly to indications of human trafficking relating to this group of children, partly because of the 
specific cultural context, the legal complexity of the problem, the risk of stigmatising the 
Roma as a group, the possible involvement of parents in the exploitation and the absence of 
a party to coordinate the actions of the agencies involved in dealing with the problem. It is, 
in any case, clear that the problems can only be dealt with proactively and from a European 
perspective.

Registration
The task of maintaining a national register of (possible) victims has been delegated to Co-
Mensha. The records are incomplete, however, and need to be improved. The Ministry of 
Justice has earmarked additional funds for CoMensha for this purpose, and as part of the 
Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan, CoMensha has submitted a plan for a project 
to improve the register. One element of the plan is that CoMensha will consult the agen-
cies that supply the information to determine which data have to be registered. It will also 
endeavour to secure a commitment from these agencies that they will actually supply the 
data.

Care coordinator
The care coordinator provides oversight in the chain of care providers and other partners 
and also tries to arrange suitable care and shelter.

NMR Ch04.indd   157 09-06-10   00:05



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

158

Many regions do not have a care coordinator. In its action plan, the Human Trafficking Task 
Force says it will encourage municipalities to appoint a regional care coordinator.

Compensation
When the judge in criminal proceedings makes an order to pay compensation, the Central 
Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) collects it on behalf of the victim. Between 2000 and 2003, 
the CJIB collected compensation in between three and five human trafficking cases. Since 
2003, the number has been significantly higher, between nine and 17 cases.
Chapter 11 also shows that is is very difficult for victim to secure payment of compensation. 
Although an order to pay compensation does mean that the victim does not personally have 
to chase the convicted person to collect the money, the procedure provides no guarantee that 
the case will be settled quickly, or that the final outcome will actually be positive.
In this context, it is important that the bill on measures to strengthen the position of victims 
in criminal proceedings includes a provision on advance payments, to be implemented by the 
Violent Offences Compensation Fund. The Minister of Justice has explained that this provi-
sion is intended for victims of violent crimes and offences against public decency. The crimes 
covered by this provision will be determined by Order in Council, but it seems obvious that 
this provision will also apply to victims of human trafficking.

The Violent Offences Compensation Fund
In assessing applications by victims (up to now only victims of sexual exploitation), the Vio-
lent Offences Compensation Fund mainly considers the extent to which the applicant was in 
such a state of dependency as to force him or her to perform sexual acts for third parties. Cir-
cumstances that could play a role in the assessment of whether or not a violent offence oc-
cured are that the victim’s passport was confiscated, the victim had to surrender all or most 
of the earnings, the victim was under constant supervision or locked up, the victim’s free-
dom of movement was constrained or the victim was intimidated or assaulted. In 2007, the 
Fund received 25 applications from victims of human trafficking, of which 18 were awarded. 
In 2008, 19 applications were submitted, one of which was rejected because human traffick-
ing was not found to have been proved on the basis of statements by the victim and further 
investigation by SGM.
As part of the Task Force’s action plan, a plan has been drawn up to increase the use of the 
compensation fund.

B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

5.1 Introduction

Immigration law contains several regulations that may be relevant for aliens who are or 
may be victims or witnesses of human trafficking and who have no valid residence permit. 
The B9 regulation (Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000) allows 
aliens who are (possible) victims or witnesses of human trafficking to stay in the Nether-
lands legally, pending an investigation and prosecution, in order to help the police and public 
prosecution service with their inquiries. 1 Chapter B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation 
Guidelines sets out the rules under which continued residence can be granted on humani-
tarian grounds – after B9 residence status has expired. The applicable legislation has been 
amended or clarified several times since the NRM’s last reports were published.

One of the positive changes to the B9 regulation is that victims who do not report the offence 
but do otherwise cooperate with an investigation and prosecution are eligible for a residence 
permit. The grounds for allowing continued residence laid down in B16/7(a) of the Aliens 
Act Implementation Guidelines (the victim has reported an offence and the criminal pro-
ceedings have resulted in a conviction) is no longer limited to prosecutions that have led to a 
conviction for human trafficking. Even if the suspect is convicted of an offence other than hu-
man trafficking, but the charges included human trafficking, the presumption in law is that 
deportation would involve risks for the victim.2 The grounds for continued residence have 
also been amended to reflect more clearly that, after three years with B9 residence status, 
the duration of the victim’s stay in the Netherlands constitutes humanitarian grounds for 
awarding an application for continued residence.NRM6

The current provisions of these regulations are summarised in §5.2. At the same time, there 
have been signals from the field that the implementation of the rules needs to be improved in 
some respects. Accordingly, NRM conducted a more detailed investigation into several issues. 
This chapter sets out the findings of various BNRM studies into the implementation of the leg-
islation: ‘abuse of B9 regulation?’ (§5.3); an analysis of rulings of courts of appeal in objection 
proceedings filed under Section 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure (§5.4; not included 
in this English translation); and an analysis of files from the Immigration and Naturalisation 

1 Nationals of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens can derive rights from the B9 
regulation in as far as they have no rights under Community law. For information about the B9 regulation, 
see also website www.b9-regeling.info.

2 In this respect, B16/7 notes that a conviction on one of the other counts in the indictment will be sufficient, 
provided that human trafficking is included in the indictment. This is a broader definition than the one given 
in recommendation 8 of NRM5, ‘another offence related to human trafficking’ (emphasis added by BNRM).

Service (IND) on continued residence after B9 (§5.5). This chapter concludes with a discussion 
of some issues which require further attention and/or improvement (§5.6).

5.2 Current legislation

5.2.1  B9 regulation

The B9 regulation allows aliens who are (possible) victims or witnesses of human trafficking 
to stay in the Netherlands legally, although temporarily, in order to help the police and public 
prosecution service with the investigation and prosecution.3 If the police or other govern-
ment agencies – during an administrative audit,4 for example – encounter aliens who may 
have fallen victim to human trafficking, they must inform them of their rights under the B9 
regulation and of the availability of a reflection period, if there is even the slightest indica-
tion that human trafficking is involved. The period of reflection allows victims a maximum 
of three months to decide whether to report the offence or otherwise to assist in the inves-
tigation and prosecution. The deportation of the victim from the Netherlands is postponed 
during the reflection periodNRM5. According to the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines, 
the rationale for this rule is that it is vital for the investigation and prosecution that victims 
who press charges or otherwise cooperate should remain available to the public prosecu-
tion service for a longer period of time. This justifies postponing deportation or granting a 
temporary residence permit. The B9 regulation also applies to witnesses who report cases 
of human trafficking.
The aim of the regulation is to ensure that aliens remain available to the police and public 
prosecution service, but it also involves the granting of a residence permit, which makes it 
something of a hybrid scheme. On the one hand, it serves the interests of the police and the 
prosecution service, while on the other, it confers a right on the victims concerned. These 
two interests do not necessarily run parallel, an aspect that is analysed in greater detail in the 
following sections.

Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines sets out the conditions for granting a 
residence permit. There are different rules for victims who report an offence or otherwise assist 
in the investigation and prosecution and for witnesses that report an offence (see §2.3).

If there is even the ‘slightest indication’5 of human trafficking, the police or other government 
agencies must inform the individual of the possibility of reporting the offence or otherwise 

3 Section 3.48 of the Aliens Decree contains special conditions governing the grant of a residence permit to 
victims who have reported an offence or who are otherwise cooperating in a human trafficking investigation 
or prosecution. The article imposes no obligation but merely grants the authorities the possibility of grant-
ing a residence permit. 

4 Consider, for example, municipal authorities and other agencies that conduct regular inspections under the 
local bye-laws or the Aliens Employment Act.

cooperating with the criminal investigation or prosecution.6 It is explained to presumed vic-
tims that they can report the offence or otherwise cooperate with the criminal investigation 
or prosecution of the suspect7 and that they can make this decision immediately or after a 
three-month period of reflection, during which they can consider their decision calmly (see 
B9 regulation). A reflection period is granted because victims of human trafficking often 
need time to recover before being able to talk about their experiences.

The rationale of the reflection period – in the sense of being a period of calm – does not 
quite tally with the provisions of the B9 regulation governing situations in which (possible) 
victims are held in aliens detention (‘in those cases a reflection period will be granted only if 
agreed to by the public prosecution service and the police’ [emphasis added by BNRM]). Nor 
is it clear what criteria apply for deciding whether a reflection period should be allowed in 
those cases. Moreover, the provision is phrased in terms of a favour (the reflection period is 
‘granted’) rather than a right.

The emphasis in these situations seems to be whether there are any indications justifying the 
investigation of human trafficking and not, or at least not primarily, whether the individual is 
a (possible) victim. This would seem to shroud the legal nature of the B9 regulation.

Victims are not allowed to work during the period of reflection.
The reflection period obviously does not apply to witnesses who have reported an offence, 
since the reflection period is intended, by its nature, to remove victims from a criminal situ-
ation and offer them the opportunity to recover and take a carefully-considered decision on 
whether to report the offence.8

Victim identification
The B9 regulation lists a number of examples of how even the slightest indications of human 
trafficking can be identified. The presence of a prostitute with no valid residence permit in a 
sex establishment may be an indication of human trafficking, and will usually be recognised 
as such. The police and other government agencies might also find potential victims of hu-
man trafficking during raids aimed at discovering illegal immigrants. Alternatively, victims 
(or witnesses) may come forward and file a report with the police of their own accord, or 
otherwise cooperate in the investigation and prosecution voluntarily.9

6 With effect from 14 November 2007, victims who do not report an offence but otherwise assist in an inves-
tigation and prosecution may also be granted a temporary residence permit, Section 3.48(1)(b) of the Aliens 
Decree, see Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees 2007, 436. ‘Assistance’ includes making a statement or being 
heard as a witness (State Secretary of Justice’s letter of 18 October 2007 on the residence status of human 
trafficking victims, Parliamentary Questions II 2007/08, 19 637, no. 1174). See also NRM6.

7 Contrary to what seems to be suggested in the recently published U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report (2009), 
this rule has been in place in the Netherlands since 1988. In fact, the maximum period of three months goes 
beyond the minimum 30-day period required under the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings (2005).

tion 3.48(1) (c) of the Aliens Decree.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

162

The National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings observed that the categories of 
aliens entitled to invoke the B9 regulation needed clarification. Practice had shown that the 
impression could arise that the B9 regulation did not apply to (possible) victims of exploita-
tion in sectors other than the sex industry (‘other forms of exploitation’), although it was not 
the intention of the regulation to make any such distinction.10 In April 2009, a new definition 
of the target groups was published to reflect more clearly the fact that the B9 regulation 
applied equally to (possible) victims of human trafficking subjected to exploitation in eco-
nomic sectors other than the sex industry, since the B9 regulation applies to the offence of 
human trafficking as defined in Section 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code.11

It is worth noting that, in early 2009, the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment 
published an information leaflet entitled ‘Exploitation at the workplace’ to raise awareness 
of exploitation and other malpractices involving potential victims. The leaflet cites examples 
of exploitation and briefly explains the rights of victims of human trafficking.12

Interviews with immigration and asylum judges indicate that the information they receive 
about the pretext for the investigation is very concise, which makes it difficult for them to 
establish whether there is any indication of human trafficking.13 The interviews also suggest 
that immigration and asylum judges perceive victimisation differently in cases of sexual ex-
ploitation than in cases involving exploitation in other economic sectors.14

The public prosecution service’s revised Instruction on Human Trafficking15 has also been 
phrased more clearly – in terms of human trafficking in the sex industry and elsewhere – 
in the sense that procedures to be followed in the context of the supervision of aliens and 
procedures for inspections and preventive controls must now always include the stipula-
tion that potential victims of human trafficking have to be given the opportunity to report 
or otherwise assist in the investigation and prosecution of the offence. Referring to the B9 
regulation, the Instruction explicitly states that if there is the ‘slightest indication’ of human 
trafficking, aliens must be advised of the possibilities available under the B9 regulation and 
informed of their entitlement to a reflection period.

As regards intake interviews, the Instruction on Human Trafficking makes it clear, once again, 
that the B9 regulation applies to investigations into ‘other forms of exploitation’, such as forced 
labour or services, as well as investigations into exploitation in the sex industry. According to 
the Instruction, prior to filing a report, an intake interview should be conducted between the 

10 It also seemed useful to clarify the B9 regulation against the background of the decision handed down by the 
Administrative Law Division of the Council of State on 30 June 2006. See NRM5, p. 79.

11 The NRM made a similar suggestion to the public prosecution service with a view to amending the Human 
Trafficking Instruction.

investigating officer and the victim. ‘During the intake interview, the victim will be granted 
the opportunity to explain what has happened to him/her. The criminal system will also be 
explained to the victim. The victim will be advised of the possibilities of shelter and care (and, 
where necessary, assisted in obtaining shelter and care). If the victim is staying in the Neth-
erlands illegally, the investigating officer will inform the victim of the rights available under 
Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (including the availability of a period 
of reflection) and of the possibility of filing a report or otherwise assisting in the investigation 
into and prosecution of human trafficking and the ensuing implications.’16

Oddly enough, as far as illegal workers who are found during an administrative or police 
inspection of a workplace are concerned, the B9 regulation makes no mention of the Labour 
Inspectorate or other special investigative agencies.17 Under the B9 regulation, the police are 
required to advise aliens of their rights under the B9 regulation (including a period of reflec-
tion) if there is the slightest indication of human trafficking. It should be evident that not 
only the police and special investigative agencies, but also the Labour Inspectorate should 
(be able to) do so immediately if it discovers illegal immigrants in a workplace (see §12.2).

It should, in any case, be clear who is responsible for providing assistance to (possible) vic-
tims in those situations. Assistance not only includes providing information about the B9 
regulation and the availability of the reflection period, but also includes referring victims to 
organisations that provide shelter, for example. The agencies involved should make clear ar-
rangements defining their duties, powers and responsibilities.
In this respect, the B9 regulation recommends that in preparing for a worksite immigration 
raid, the police should also explicitly focus on human trafficking and preparations should be 
made to provide shelter to potential victims human of trafficking. Prior to the raid, the police 
should, for example, contact the Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha), 
which can in turn alert the regional networks and contact care agencies in the victim’s home 
country.18

The B9 regulation, incidentally, notes that ‘the care coordinator will be responsible for en-
suring that victims are properly advised of the legal implications of making a complaint or 
otherwise assisting in a criminal investigation or prosecution. If legal advice is needed, a 
legal aid worker can be engaged. Legal aid workers will be paid the usual fees by the Legal 
Aid Council.’19

Aliens with no valid residence permit who have worked in the Netherlands and who personally 
contact the police (or a special investigative agency such as the Social Intelligence and Investiga-
tion Service [SIOD]) may also assert rights under the B9 regulation and avail of the reflection 
period. Again, no mention is made of the Labour Inspectorate. The ‘Exploitation at the work-
place’ leaflet states that it is possible – in addition to reporting the offence to the police – to file 

16 Government Gazette 2008, 253.

a complaint with the Labour Inspectorate. This in itself provides no basis for asserting rights 
under the B9 regulation; filing a complaint with the Labour Inspectorate does not equate with 
pressing charges or otherwise assisting in a (criminal) investigation. However, if a complaint is 
filed with the Labour Inspectorate, it does constitute a ‘slight indication’ and may lead to a crimi-
nal investigation. Accordingly, it should be possible for the Labour Inspectorate to advise aliens 
who contact the Inspectorate voluntarily of their rights under the B9 regulation, including the 
reflection period. This is supported by international standards:

Government agencies that deal with possible victims of human trafficking, such as the police, 
Labour Inspectorate, Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and Dutch embassies 
abroad, should be able to identify those victims and refer them to support organisations. This 
follows from Article 10 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking 
in Human Beings (2005), which the Netherlands intends to ratify (for more information, see 
Chapter 3, International developments, §3.6). Under Article 10, the Netherlands must ensure 
that those government agencies will be able to carry out their duties. If a government agency 
suspects that someone has fallen victim to human trafficking, the agency must arrange for care 
to be provided for that person. This means, first of all, that agency staff must be trained to rec-
ognise signs of human trafficking.

Registration of (possible) victims with CoMensha
The police must notify CoMensha if they have found a (possible) victim of human trafficking 
and he or she wishes to use the period of reflection.20 This is important with a view to providing 
the (suspected) victim with shelter. It is equally important that the police notify CoMensha of 
every report of (possible) victims for the purposes of monitoring national progress in the fight 
against human trafficking.21 This duty to register (possible) victims is not confined to foreign 
victims. According to the Instruction on Human Trafficking, the chief constables of the police 
forces must register the victims of all forms of human trafficking with CoMensha,22 without 
any distinction in terms of the victims’ nationality or residence status.
Other government agencies that might have dealings with (possible) victims of human traf-
ficking should also be allowed to refer victims to organisations that can provide them with 
assistance.23

B9 and asylum
Similarly, aliens who, pending an application for asylum, turn out to be victims of human traf-
ficking can assert their rights under the B9 regulation. If a B9 permit is granted, the asylum 
application will be refused. Once the B9 permit has expired, however, a second asylum appli-
cation, if it is made, will be reviewed on its merits and not be denied for being a repeat applica-

on Trafficking in Human Beings in preparing its reports.

tion.24 It is possible, however, for victims to report the crime without wishing to assert rights 
under the B9 regulation. In such cases, the asylum procedure will continue as normal.

Victims in aliens’ detention
A period of reflection may also be granted to aliens held in detention (under Section 59 of the 
Dutch Aliens Act).25 If there are indications suggesting that an alien in detention has been a 
victim of human trafficking, the police must inform him or her of the possibility of reporting 
the offence or otherwise assisting them in the criminal investigation or prosecution. In these 
cases too, potential human trafficking victims are entitled to a period of reflection. Granting 
a period of reflection removes the legal basis of detention, which must therefore be lifted. It 
can be inferred from the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines, however, that in these situa-
tions a reflection period is granted only if the public prosecution service and the police agree 
to it. The criteria for doing this are not yet clear, nor are the implications in practiceNRM6.
In early 2008, the Repatriation and Departure Service (DT&V) published the Protocol on 
Procedures for Victims of Human Trafficking, which provides a step-by-step description of 
what needs to be done by the officer handling the case26 when dealing with a potential human 
trafficking victim (see §8.3.2, identification in the repatriation procedure /aliens detention).

In January 2009, BLinN published a report entitled ‘Uitgebuit en in de bak! Slachtoffers van 
mensenhandel in vreemdelingendetentie’. The report’s most important conclusion was that im-
provements were needed in identifying victims held in aliens detention. BLinN found that the 
police sometimes handle situations poorly by failing to identify victims, to respond quickly and 
correctly to requests to press charges or to offer a period of reflection, as required by the B9 
regulation. Another sticking point is that cases are sometimes dropped without an ensuing for-
mal decision not to prosecute: cases are ‘discontinued’ without the victims or their lawyers be-
ing notified of the discontinuance or a formal decision not to prosecute, which causes the time 
limits for filing an objection against the non-prosecution decision or filing an appeal against 
revocation of the B9 residence status to be exceeded without anyone noticing. BlinN also cites 
the limited scope of the duties entrusted to the Repatriation and Departure Service (DT&V) as 
a problem: the DT&V notifies the police or the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee of potential 
victims of human trafficking. If no action is taken on the basis of this notification, the DT&V 
simply resumes the deportation proceedings. BLinN also refers to the passive role played by the 
IND’s gender-liaison officers, who do not actively identify victims but only act on reports from 
the police and Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, and to lawyers who do not always do a good 
job or who may have insufficient knowledge of the issue of human trafficking and the related 
procedures. Problems also occur during the transition from detention to a shelter: there is a 

24 Government Gazette 2007, 68 (5 April).
25 This issue was clarified in the Amendment to the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000 (2008/09) of 

21 February 2008, Government Gazette 2008, 37.
26 Aliens who are staying in the Netherlands illegally are expected to leave of their own accord or face deporta-

tion. In January 2007, an independent agency, the Repatriation and Departure Service (DT&V), was set up 
to oversee this procedure. The Repatriation and Departure Service encourages aliens who are not eligible 
for a residence permit to leave the country voluntarily. This is done by means of a series of repatriation in-
terviews, all conducted by the same officer. For more information about the identification of victims by the 
Repatriation and Departure Service, see Chapter 8.

shortage of shelters, there is not enough knowledge about aliens detention, and there are no 
facilities available for victims who do not report an offence (or who are afraid to do so). BlinN 
concludes that victims of human trafficking should never be held in aliens detention.
In its response to the report, the government stated that a large number of measures had been 
taken since 2005 to improve the process of identifying victims and that the issue was still high 
on its agenda (State Secretary of Justice’s letter, Parliamentary Questions II 2008/09, 28 638, 
no. 41), offering an assurance that the quality of implementation – i.e. early and careful identi-
fication – remained important. Nevertheless, The State Secretary believed that detaining (pos-
sible) victims of human trafficking could not always be avoided. Occasionally, victims were 
not identified as such until after they had been detained (report of the plenary debate, 10 June 
2009, Parliamentary Questions II 2008/09, 28 638, no 44.

After reporting the offence/cooperation
If a victim decides – whether after a period of reflection or otherwise – to press charges or to co-
operate in the investigation and prosecution in another manner, either action will be treated as 
an application for a temporary residence permit under the B9 regulation. The IND will decide 
on the residence permit, with the public prosecution service being notified of its decision.
As a rule, the residence permit will be granted for one year, pending the investigation, pros-
ecution and trial of the suspect in a court of first instance. The person concerned will be al-
lowed to stay in the Netherlands legally. Previously this only applied until the court of appeal 
handed down its decision, but since 2 June 2008 the person can wait until the Supreme Court 
has heard the criminal case 27. The residence permit expires if the public prosecution serv-
ice decides not to prosecute, no appeal is lodged against the district court’s decision, or the 
court of appeal has rendered a decision and no appeal is lodged with the Supreme Court (the 
decision thus having become final and irrevocable).28 Under the terms of the regulation, the 
public prosecution service is required to notify the IND and the victim accordingly.29 When 
considering a renewal application, the IND must contact the public prosecution service to 
check whether a criminal investigation or prosecution is still ongoing.30

Objection
If the public prosecution service decides not to prosecute, the police must notify the victim 
of the decision not to prosecute or to discontinue the prosecution against the suspect (the 
decision not to prosecute). Victims may file an objection with the court of appeal (under Sec-
tion 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure) on the grounds that their interests have 
been directly affected. Within two weeks of being notified of the decision not to prosecute, 
the victim must inform the police as to whether he or she will be filing an objection with the 

27 Government Gazette 2008, 102 (30 May 2008).
28 Victims are not permitted to stay in the Netherlands to await the outcome of an appeal filed with the Su-

preme Court ‘in the interest of the law’, because this type of appeal does not affect the parties’ rights and 
status and hence will have no legal implications for them. See B9/8.1.

court of appeal,31 but there is no time limit for filing an objection. If the victim has pressed 
charges or is otherwise cooperating and holds a residence permit, the B9 residence status 
will remain in place until the court of appeal has dealt with the objection.32

The situation is rather confusing, Aside from informing the police within the two-week pe-
riod after notification of the decision not to prosecute, there is no time limit for filing the ac-
tual objection – except where a notification of discharge from further prosecution is served 
on a suspect. In that case, there is a three-month time limit. 33 (It should be noted that there is 
not always an immediate suspect in human trafficking cases).
It is not clear precisely what the purpose of the two-week time limit for notifying the police 
is. It only seems relevant in terms of the implications for the victim’s residence status. It cer-
tainly has no bearing on the period within which the objection must actually be filed.
It is quite possible, however, that the two-week time limit ‘automatically’ forces victims to 
file an objection against a decision not to prosecute. Consultations between legal counsel 
and the IND may result in the two-week limit being extended to allow more time to consider 
the pros and cons of commencing objection proceedings.34

The various offices of the public prosecution service do not apply a standard approach when 
deciding not to prosecute human trafficking cases,35 but efforts are being made to improve 
this situation. The public prosecution service has announced that it will draw up a memo-
randum on the B9 working methods applied by the police and the service itself, which will 
provide details of those actions that particularly need to be taken when a decision on ‘not to 
act on’, ‘not to continue investigating’ or ‘not to prosecute’ reports of human trafficking is 
taken. The aim is to define more clearly who has to be informed and how this notification is 
to be documented.

Facilities
Victims wishing to use the period of reflection will be entitled to shelter; medical, social and 
psychological support; legal aid; and a benefit to pay for the cost of living during this period 
of up to three months. During the period of reflection, victims are also insured against medi-
cal expenses. An interpreter will be provided if necessary. After reporting the offence – or 
otherwise cooperating – victims will be issued with a residence permit and, on the basis of 
their status as a legal alien, gain access to housing, education, study grants,36 and employ-

31 B9/10.
32 If the (possible) victim does not yet have a residence permit, the police chief constable will postpone the 

deportation of the victim until the court of appeal has handed down its decision. See B9/10.
33 Section 12l(2) of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure reads: ‘If the objection concerns an offence in re-

spect of which the suspect has been notified that no further prosecution will take place, the objection must 
be filed within three months of the party directly affected becoming aware of such notification.’

34 Information from a lawyer who specialises in providing legal advice to victims of human trafficking.
35 In 2008, the public prosecution office in Utrecht prepared a standard letter that it sends to victims, with cop-

ies forwarded to their lawyers and the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, if there are no indications 
justifying any investigation into the allegations of human trafficking. 

36 As far as study grants and allowances for educational payments and school tuition fees are concerned, they 
will have the same rights as Dutch citizens, Government Gazette 2007, 264.

ment. Victims who have B9 residence status are free to work once they have received a B9 
residence permit;37 they require no work permit.38

Local authorities are sometimes unclear about the rights and obligations arising from the B9 
regulation. The question of whether a B9 residence card must be registered in the Municipal 
Personal Records Database is a case in point. The Minister and State Secretary of Justice 
have indicated that they are working on improving the provision of information to, and shar-
ing of knowledge with, local authorities with regard to the B9 regulation and the issue of 
residence cards.39

No charges/no cooperation; what to do next?
In April 2007, Fatma Koser Kaya (MP for D66) and Naïma Azough (MP for GroenLinks) 
asked the Minister to explore the possibility of extending the B9 regulation to include ‘unac-
companied underage aliens if any of the assistance agencies involved indicate there is rea-
son to believe they have fallen victim to human trafficking, even if the victims do not press 
charges.40 In a letter of 18 October 200741, the State Secretary wrote that she saw no reason 
to extend the B9 regulation along those lines. In her opinion, the discretionary power (con-
ferred by Article 3.4(3) of the Aliens Act 2000) to depart from the general rules in favour of 
aliens provided enough leeway to grant residence status to victims who do not press charges, 
if circumstances were so desperate as to necessitate such an action.

In the Netherlands, granting (temporary) residence status to victims of human trafficking 
under the B9 regulation depends on their willingness to cooperate in the investigation and 
prosecution. This is permitted under the Convention. Member states are free to decide 
which criteria they wish to apply for granting permits to victims of human trafficking: the 
victim’s personal situation and/or his or her willingness to cooperate with the authorities 
in the investigation or criminal proceedings.42 In the Netherlands, some forms of assistance 
for victims are linked to this residence status – unless residence status is applied for on oth-
er grounds, such as humanitarian grounds. The Council of Europe’s Convention requires 
member states to provide such standards of living as to enable victims of human trafficking 
to “ensure their subsistence through such measures as accommodation, psychological and 

37 The residence document will say ‘Restriction as per Minister’s decision. Free to work. No work permit re-
quired.’ This is to make it less obvious to third parties on what grounds the victim (or witness) of a human 
trafficking offence is staying in the Netherlands, Government Gazette 2007, 87 (7 May).

38 Under the B9 regulation, the victim or witness may continue to work in the sex industry, even if she was 
previously not allowed to do so as a self-employed person or as an employee because she had no permit. See 
Fifth NRM Report, p. 32.

material assistance, access to emergency medical treatment, translation and interpretation 
services, legal aid, representation, and access to education for children.”43

The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill to ratify the Convention states that vic-
tims wishing to use the period of reflection are entitled during this period to secure accommo-
dation, medical, social and psychological support, legal aid, and a benefit to pay for the cost of 
living, and that they will be insured against medical expenses. An interpreter will be provided 
if necessary.44 After reporting an offence – or otherwise cooperating – victims will be issued 
with a residence permit and, on the basis of their status as a legal alien, gain access to most fa-
cilities. Apart from the facilities referred to above, these include access to housing, education, 
study grants, and employment. Holding a residence permit is not a requirement for receiving 
urgent medical assistance. Nor is it a requirement for access to education for minors.
Reporting the crime is not an absolute requirement for obtaining assistance.45 Victims who 
are unable to press charges or otherwise cooperate, and who are not eligible for a residence 
permit on the basis that they are victims, may nonetheless be eligible for a residence permit 
in circumstances of extreme hardship (continued residence for urgent reasons of a humani-
tarian nature, see §5.2.2).
Strictly speaking, the Netherlands is in compliance with the relevant (minimum) standards. 
It should be added, however, that several international bodies that monitor compliance with 
human rights have made it clear, referring to the Netherlands and other countries, that pro-
viding assistance to victims of human trafficking should not depend on their willingness to 
cooperate in a criminal investigation.46 On a positive note, the State Secretary has promised 
to look at how, for example, Italy has gone about disconnecting the granting of residence 
permits from the requirement that victims cooperate in criminal proceedings, and what the 
implications of such a move would be.47

Witnesses/complainants
Witnesses who have reported a human trafficking offence may also obtain a temporary resi-
dence permit under the B9 regulation, if they have no valid residence status in the Nether-
lands. Witnesses/complainants may be aliens working in the same industry as the victim. 
They may also work in other sectors and have information about human trafficking.48

no. 3, pp. 9-10 (24 April 2008).

45 It is worth noting that the Explanatory Memorandum at that time inadvertently stated that the Aliens De-
cree, as amended, would provide that victims who did not press charges but who did otherwise cooperate 
with the police and public prosecution service would be issued with a residence permit that gave access to as-
sistance, insofar and as long as the public prosecution service required their presence in the Netherlands (emphasis 
added by BRNM).

170

In contrast to applications from victims, when a residence permit application is received 
from a witness/complainant, the contact person for human trafficking cases at the Immigra-
tion and Naturalisation Service (IND) must contact the public prosecution service, which 
has the decisive say in whether or not to issue a residence permit to witnesses/complain-
ants.49 The criterion applied is whether the presence of the witness/complainant is required 
in the interests of the investigation and prosecution of the suspect.50

A distinction is also made between victims and witness/complainants in terms of the time 
limit within which the IND has to decide on the application. As a rule, applications from 
victims must be handled within 24 hours of the application being faxed by the police to the 
IND. It‘s stated that this time limit simply cannot be met for applications from witnesses/
complainants because of the obligation to consult with the public prosecution service prior 
to making a decision.51 As shown by the following case, these differences in the policy rules 
for victims and witnesses can lead to confusion.

In June 2007, the applicant, who was from Togo, went to the Amsterdam-Amstelland regional 
police force to report a human trafficking offence of which he himself was a victim. He claimed 
that the IND subsequently treated him as a witness/complainant rather than a victim and failed 
to decide on his application within the prescribed 24 hours. He also claimed that both his appli-
cation and his complaint about the absence of a decision were dealt with by the same member 
of staff at the IND.
While acknowledging that the IND had initially been misinformed by the police, the National 
Ombudsman made the following findings:

 – the IND had subsequently received sufficient information indicating that the case involved a 
victim. By failing to act on this information, the IND had violated its duty to actively gather 
sufficient information.

 – the IND could not be faulted for failing to handle the application within 24 hours because 
it had not received the correct information. However, its failure to monitor progress in the 
proceedings and the fact that it did not issue a decision until five months later, meant that the 
IND had acted in violation of its duty to act expeditiously.

 – the anti-bias principle (Section 9.7 of the General Administrative Law Act) had been vio-
lated, because the same member of staff had dealt with both the application and the com-
plaint.

 – Finally, it was recommended that the State Secretary consider amending the B9 regulation 
such that the aliens agency (i.e. the IND) would henceforth send aliens and their lawyers a 
copy of the M55 Form. National Ombudsman, report number 2009/0026, 11 February 2009, 
Migratieweb ve09000219.

49 This more or less reflects the situation where people held in aliens detention, or detained at Schiphol Air-
port, are identified as victims.

B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

171

The legal residence document issued to witnesses/complainants states that they are not per-
mitted to perform work.52 This changes once they have been granted a residence permit un-
der the B9 regulation, when they are free to take a job and no work permit is required.53

The residence permit will remain valid as long as the public prosecution service considers it 
necessary that the witness stay in the Netherlands.54 Under the regulation, the public pros-
ecution service is required to notify the IND and the witness/complainant accordingly. The 
permit will be revoked if the case is dropped by the public prosecution service, if no appeal 
is lodged against the district court’s decision in the case against the suspect or if the court of 
appeal has rendered a decision.55

The B9 regulation suggests that witnesses/complainants may file an objection with the court 
of appeal under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the suspect is not prosecuted 
or the prosecution is discontinued (i.e. the case is dropped).56 Similar to victims, they may 
await the outcome of the objection proceedings in the Netherlands.57

decline in the proportion granted is that more ‘chanceless B9 applications’ were made in 
2008 than in previous years.59 On this point has to be taken into consideration that the men-
tioned percentages are of relatively limited importance, because not all applications are dealt 
with in the year of application.

in 2006 to 40% in 2008). The number of foreign victims eventually accepting the reflection 
period fluctuated: 49% in 2006, 87% in 2007 and 67% in 2008.
In 2007 and 2008, 60% of victims who had accepted a reflection period went on to press 
charges. This is quite a high percentage compared to the percentage of total victims regis-
tered with CoMensha who pressed charges (33% in 2007 and 30% in 2008). Of all victims 
who pressed charges in 2007, 18% were Dutch nationals, compared to 11% in 2008.
These findings and developments should be interpreted cautiously, knowing that a lot of in-
formation is unknown, as shown in Tables 5.2 to 5.4. It is equally unclear whether CoMensha 
knows for each case whether a reflection period was used.

5.2.3 Continued residence (B16/7)

If legal basis for a residence permit under the B9 regulation lapses, the individual concerned 
must leave the Netherlands, unless he or she applies in a timely fashion for an amended per-
mit for a different purpose and meets the requirements for such an amendment. One of the 
options is to apply for an independent continued residence permit under Article 3.52 of the 
Aliens Decree.
As a rule, victims of human trafficking and witnesses/complainants can apply for continued 
residence. The have to base an application for an independent continued residence permit on 
urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature. This is not, however, a permanent residence per-
mit. Aliens can apply for permanent residence status after five years of continued residence.
Because in practice the possibility of being granted continued residence on humanitarian 
grounds had been limitedNRM3, the regulation as it stood then was the subject of protracted 
debate. The policy on continued residence after B9 statusNRM5 was amended with effect from

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

14 August 2006.62 The then Minister for Immigration and Integration relaxed the condi-
tions, as shown below:63

Victims of human trafficking
An application for continued residence will invariably be granted if the victim presses charg-
es or otherwise cooperates in criminal proceedings (a) that have ultimately resulted in a con-
viction or (b) that, although not ultimately resulting in a conviction, involve a victim who at 
the time of the court decision had been residing in the Netherlands on a B9 residence permit 
for three or more years.

If the charges pressed by a victim of trafficking have ultimately led to the suspect being con-
victed of human trafficking64, since 14 August 2006 the Minister accepts that there is a pre-
sumption in law that the victim’s return to his or her home country would involve risks (see 
(a) above). If, in those circumstances, the victim applies for continued residence, the appli-
cation will be granted for that reason. With effect from 23 February 2008, a continued resi-
dence application may also be awarded if the criminal case in which the victim cooperated 
has led to an irrevocable conviction for another offence, provided that human trafficking was 
included as a charge in the indictmentNRM6.65

This amendment to the rules on continued residence laid down in the Aliens Act Implemen-
tation Guidelines had been recommended in the fifth report of the NRM. The eighth recom-
mendation was that the grounds for continued residence as set out in B16/7(a) of the Aliens Act 
Implementation Guidelines (i.e. the victim has reported an offence and the criminal proceed-
ings have led to a conviction) should not be limited to criminal cases resulting in a conviction for 
human trafficking, but should also include cases resulting in a conviction of an offence related 
to human trafficking. If a charge of human trafficking was brought and the suspect was con-
victed of an offence other than human trafficking,66 the presumption in law now is that the victim 
would run a risk if he or she were to return to his or her home country.

62 Parliamentary Documents II 2005/06, 28 638, no. 26. The letter resulted in the Amendment to the Aliens Act 
Implementation Guidelines (2006/36A), 8 November 2006 (Government Gazette 2006, 225).

63 The policy change was intended to simplify and accelerate the process of handling continued residence ap-
plications after B9 status, align the policy with the general policy governing continued residence (Section 
3.51 of the Aliens Decree), and clarify and improve the position of victims. Another aim was to increase 
the number of continued residence permits awarded after expiry of B9 status. The Minister pointed to the 
limited number of continued residence applications, citing as a possible reason lack of awareness among 
victims of the options available under the policy. However, legal aid and victim assistance agencies described 
the heavy burden of proof resting on the victims as a major factor.

64 For human trafficking. In 2007, twenty cases tried at first instance – accounting for 19% of a total of 108 court 
decisions reviewed – resulted in an acquittal on human trafficking charges and a conviction on one or more 
other counts. See Chapter 11, Case law on exploitation in the sex industry, §11.2.

65 Government Gazette 21 February 2008, 37.
66 On this issue, B16/7 notes that a conviction on one of the other counts in the indictment will be sufficient, 

provided that human trafficking is included as a charge. As previously stated, this is a broader definition than 
the one given in recommendation 8 of the fifth report of the NRM, ‘another offence related to human traffick-
ing’ (emphasis added by BNRM).

B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

175

With this amendment, the assessment of whether an individual is a victim has largely passed 
from the courts to the public prosecution service. This test could, in fact, be fully entrusted 
to the public prosecution service without having to revise the policy.
The public prosecution service’s decision to prosecute should be sufficient grounds for the 
IND to grant continued residence status to victims. At the same time, safeguards will have 
to be introduced to ensure that victims remain available to the police and public prosecution 
service. However, if the public prosecution service decides not to prosecute for technical rea-
sons (e.g. the suspect cannot be found), they should, as a standard procedure, send the IND 
a statement confirming that the individual is a victim.
This does not, of course, affect the possibility provided for in B16/7 of the Aliens Act Imple-
mentation Guidelines of granting continued residence if, in the State Secretary’s opinion, the 
victim cannot be required to leave the Netherlands given the special individual circumstanc-
es of the case. This discretion would be extended to include the latter category of victims, if 
the twelfth recommendation in the third report of the NRM were adopted. Victim assistance 
organisations should be assigned an important role in reviewing these applications.

Aliens wishing to invoke B16/7(a) have to present a copy of the court decision to demonstrate 
that they are eligible for continued residence. However, victims are not party to the criminal 
proceedings and do not automatically receive a copy of the court decision. In fact, they may 
not even be aware of a decision having been rendered.

Moreover, with effect from 14 August 2006, if a criminal case does not result in a conviction, 
and three years have elapsed between the grant of B9 residence status and the date on which 
the court decision became irrevocable, the Minister will consider the duration of the victim’s 
residence to be the key humanitarian factor in taking a decision (see ground b for granting a 
residence permit at the beginning of this section).

In other words, victims who have been staying in the Netherlands on a B9 residence permit for 
three years may apply for continued residence even if the criminal case is ongoing (theoretically 
speaking, even before any decision to drop the case has been made).67 This change was imple-
mented in February 2008. In these cases, provided that there are no other general grounds for 
refusal, the application will be grantedNRM6. The policy does not apply to cases in which victims 
pressed charges or otherwise cooperated with the police but no prosecution ensued.

Non-punishment
There are cases in which victims are suspected and, eventually, convicted of an offence. In 
practice, this may have implications for undocumented victims in terms of their right to stay 
on the basis of their being trafficking victims. Because of the victim’s criminal record, even 
if the offence was committed in a human trafficking situation (criminal exploitation), the 
victim may be declared persona non grata and refused continued residence under B16.68 In 

67 Government Gazette 21 February 2008, 37, p. 11.
68 This issue is explained in greater detail in §6.3.1 of this report on the basis of case studies.

deciding to declare victims persona non grata and deport them, explicit consideration should 
be given to the link between the offences committed and the human trafficking situation. 
The fact that these are victims of human trafficking and criminal exploitation69 should, in 
any case, weigh heavily when their application for continued residence is reviewed.

Human trafficking victims and witnesses/complainants whose complaints/cooperation did not re-
sult in a criminal case or court decision
Continued residence applications for these categories of aliens will only be awarded if, given 
the special circumstances of the case, the alien cannot be required to leave the Netherlands. 
Fear of reprisals, the risk of prosecution in their home country (for prostitution, for exam-
ple), or the absence of possibilities for social reintegration may all be reasons for allowing 
them to stay. According to the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines, these are not the only 
factors that are relevant in assessing whether a victim or witness/complainant should be 
granted residence status for urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature. Mental-health prob-
lems for which victims or witnesses are being treated in the Netherlands, the fact that they 
are responsible for the care of children born or receiving education in the Netherlands, or 
the position of women in the country of origin may also be grounds for awarding the resi-
dence applicationNRM6. If a witness/complainant presses charges and these have resulted in 
a conviction of the suspect(s), the question of whether the conviction might trigger repris-
als should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The operative assumption is not necessarily 
the same for victims and witness/complainants, although this would be logical. Again, the 
suspect(s) must have been convicted of human trafficking, or of another offence in an indict-
ment where human trafficking was one of the charges.
According to the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines, if psychological or other medical 
grounds are invoked, these will merely be one of several factors to be considered.70 If only 
medical grounds are invoked, ‘an assessment in light of the policy rules on medical treatment 
would be more appropriate.’ On this issue, see §5.5.
Victims or witnesses will themselves have to explain what urgent reasons of a humanitarian 
nature justify granting continued residence, as well as submitting relevant data and docu-
ments to substantiate their application.71

5.3 ‘Abuse’ of the B9 regulation?

Ever since it was established, BNRM has been alerted to aspects of the fight against human 
trafficking that need to be improved. Victim-care organisations and interest groups, for ex-
ample, regularly make comments and complaints about cases involving victims of human 
trafficking that have not been properly dealt with by the police and the public prosecution 

69 See §6.3.
70 B16/7.
71 If the application is not substantiated or insufficiently so, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service will 

allow the alien an opportunity to remedy this failure, usually a period of two weeks.

service. These often involve foreign victims (whether or not held in aliens detention) who are 
given no opportunity to report an offence or offered no period of reflection or B9 residence 
status, or whose cases have, in their view, been dropped or shelved for no valid reason.
At the same time, the police and public prosecution service say they have to devote a lot 
of resources to dealing with ‘hopeless B9 applications’. They are referring to situations in 
which foreign nationals who have been asked to leave the Netherlands, or who have only a 
limited chance of obtaining residence, claim they are victims of trafficking – sometimes at 
the very end of the proceedings – or are identified as such by their lawyer or a care provider. 
They report a human trafficking offence and obtain a B9 residence permit from the IND. If 
they are held in aliens detention, the detention is lifted. However, the reports they file contain 
few if any leads for an investigation and/or the offences were committed such a long time ago 
that they are difficult to investigate or verify. These cases rarely result in a conviction, but 
they do tend to place a strain on resources because they have to be investigated, according 
to the Instruction on Human Trafficking. Some of the agencies involved suspect that the ‘B9 
route’ is used by people who are not victims of trafficking, but who just want to stay in the 
Netherlands.72 BNRM has studied this problem and organised an experts’ meeting to brain-
storm about possible solutions. The study reviewed 16 cases, all of which involved suspected 
abuses of the regulation.73 Details of the study and the methodology are given in Appendix 2. 
This section looks at the findings of the study and the conclusions of the meeting of experts. 
Further research will, however, be needed.

The study and the experts’ meeting identified the factors that had led the police and public 
prosecution service to doubt the credibility of the complaints filed, and those that had pre-
vented the cases from being dealt with successfully (regardless of whether the complainants 
were perceived as victims). These factors, the problems encountered, and possible solutions 
are discussed below. In this section, reference will be made to the neutral term ‘complain-
ants’ rather than ‘victims’.

The importance of obtaining residence status
Those cases in which there were suspicions of abuse of the B9 regulation involved foreign 
victims who had no prospects of obtaining residence, but who did wish to stay in the Neth-
erlands. This shows that complainants have multiple interests. Obtaining a residence permit 
might, however, be of greater importance to them than having the perpetrator(s) caught and 
tried. In fact, they may have no interest at all in having the perpetrators caught and tried be-
cause of the risks involved. If they were to be required to return to their home country, they 
might well run into the perpetrators and face all sorts of recriminations.

72 As cited in the ACVZ’s advisory report “Protect victims and fight human trafficking” (February 2009, p. 33). 
LEM estimates that half of all B9 applications are ‘questionable’.

73 First of all, an inventory was made of all cases in which the police had suspicions of abuse. This produced 88 
cases from 13 police areas. Next, a random selection of 16 cases was made to identify those factors that had 
caused the police to doubt the credibility of the complainant and/or the story of human trafficking. The 16 
cases involved people from Africa and China reporting human trafficking offences.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

A related hypothesis is that victims of human trafficking press charges to obtain B9 residence 
status, assistance and protection, but at the same time try to prevent the perpetrators from 
being caught (and really have no wish to volunteer information). Reports of this kind usually 
contain few leads on which to base an investigation. Theoretically speaking, the possibility 
can not be ruled out that obtaining residence status is so important that individuals make up 
a human trafficking story just to become eligible for B9 residence status. This possibility has 
been widely publicised in the press, with headlines like ‘Illegal immigrants use new trick to 
stay’,74 or ‘Human trafficking charges often false’.75 One of the reasons for assuming that this 
does happen is that individuals sometimes come up with a human trafficking story precisely 
at the time they are required to leave the Netherlands, having not previously done so at earlier 
opportunities. Suspicions of abuse abound, but they can rarely be substantiated. The public 
prosecution service has prosecuted people for bringing false charges in only a few cases.
Service providers assisting the complainant, such as lawyers and victim-care providers, may 
also be motivated by the importance of obtaining a residence permit for their client.

Few useful leads, inconsistencies, falsehoods, implausible stories
In nearly all of the cases reviewed, there were no investigative leads so these cases could not 
be solved. For example, complainants only knew the perpetrators by their first names or ali-
ases (‘Good Boy’, ‘Mister’), could only provide vague descriptions and could not be specific 
about where they had been staying (‘in a flat in neighbourhood X’, a neighbourhood that 
only has blocks of flats). The statements also contained inconsistencies and provided incor-
rect information about age, identity and previous asylum applications. This makes it difficult 
for the police to investigate and reduces the chance of a successful prosecution.
Moreover, stories about human trafficking are not always plausible, although it cannot be 
ruled out that complainants are telling the truth. In one case, the complainant alleged there 
had been a passer-by in the country of origin who had helped the complainant get to the 
Netherlands for no consideration; the passer-by arranged and paid for the journey and iden-
tity documents, asking nothing in return. That is hardly likely. Nigerians sometimes tell 
strikingly similar stories, but the details are not very plausible. They claim they have told 
their story to a complete stranger in the street or at a bus stop, when they are hardly capable 
of telling their story to others, out of shame, fear or for other reasons. Moreover, they were 
then referred not to the police or a victim assistance agency, but to an asylum centre in a dif-
ferent place, with the train or bus fare being paid for them.76

A key question is whether complainants cannot or do not want to provide more detail. Apart 
from the fact that obtaining residence status is important for them, and supplying information 

74 De Telegraaf, 2 July 2009.
75 Algemeen Dagblad, 7 April 2009.
76 There has, incidentally, been a case in which young Nigerian women were instructed by their traffickers to 

press charges of human trafficking to become eligible for B9 residence status. These young women were 
then picked up by the traffickers at the shelter where they were staying and put to work as prostitutes. More 
information on this case is provided in Chapter 9, §9.5.5.

might involve risks, the complainant’s cultural background might play a role as well. In the cases 
studied, the complainants were from Africa and China. African victims often have had little ed-
ucation and the world they live in is different from the Western way of life. Although this is just 
speculation, they might not remember the kinds of facts that the police and public prosecution 
service would regard as investigative leads. What airline did you use? What was the destination 
of your flight? What did the accommodation look like? These are perhaps difficult questions 
for them to answer. In one of the cases reviewed, a young woman gave a very unusual descrip-
tion of a camera, presumably because she had never seen one before. An article published in 
a Dutch daily newspaper on 31 January 2009 suggested that it was also difficult for doctors to 
obtain information about health complaints from Africans,77 so the problem does not seem to 
be confined to criminal investigations. Another example is that people from China have little 
faith in government agencies. Accordingly, they are unlikely to confide in government officials 
and usually tell little about what has happened to them.78 It should be added that traumas can af-
fect a person’s memory and, hence, the quality of the information reported to the police.79 The 
same goes for language barriers. Certain sexual expressions, for instance, which are necessary 
to describe the offence, are sometimes difficult to translate or untranslatable.

Follow-up of ‘hopeless’ B9 applications
Although there were few investigative leads, and offences had sometimes been committed 
a long time previously (after an asylum procedure or long-term illegal stay), in the major-
ity of cases reviewed by BNRM, an attempt had been made to solve the case in accordance 
with the Instruction on Human Trafficking. It should be added that, in some cases, this was 
done because the police and public prosecution service expected that objection proceedings 
would be filed,80 requiring them to relaunch the investigation, which would of course hardly 
be efficient. The cases reviewed had all been dropped or were expected to be dropped. The 
police and public prosecution service say that investigating these reports puts a strain on 
resources, especially in cases where they know in advance that any follow-up actions cannot 
possibly result in a conviction. These cases sometime caused other cases of human traffick-
ing cases to be put on the back burner, which the authorities feel should not be allowed to 
happen. This is perceived as a major problem.
On the other side of the argument, victim-assistance organisations and lawyers (who do 
not necessarily represent the same interests as the police and public prosecution service) 
complain about the way in which reports are dealt with. The police and public prosecution 
service – who of course also wish to protect victims – primarily require information about 
human trafficking in order to launch and successfully complete an investigation. What has 
happened? Where? When? Can anyone be linked to the crime? This information is not al-

ways provided to a sufficient extent when the offence is reported and can prove insufficient 
even when investigative action is undertaken. And so cases have to be dropped. Whether or 
not there are sufficient investigative leads is, of course, a matter for debate, a debate that is 
ongoing. And the police and public prosecution service also make mistakes. In a recent study, 
BLinN revealed that reports are not acted on, or are not acted on quickly enough.81 On the 
other hand, a review of cases in which an objection was filed shows that in nearly all cases the 
police had done a good job (see §5.4 and following sections). An additional study revealed 
that providers of assistance sometimes expect more from the police and public prosecution 
service than is possible or realistic. Assistance providers sometimes urge the police to in-
tervene, when they have no legal power to do so. Or they urge the police to go and look for 
landmarks along a route described by the victim, although this is time consuming and adds 
little in the way of tactical value, in that it will not necessarily lead to the ‘scene of the crime’. 
In some cases, complainants suffered other horrific things like rape, but were not traffick-
ing victims and could not invoke B9 residence status. This causes frustration and – because 
the provision on human trafficking is broadly phrased – leads to discussions about whether 
there may also have been human trafficking involved.82

Challenges and solutions
What precisely is the problem? The problem is reports of human trafficking that contain 
little or no information (investigative leads). These impose a strain on the resources of the 
police and public prosecution service because the reports must be processed and what few 
leads there are must be investigated,83 even when it is often clear from the start that the per-
petrators will not be found. This is not only demotivating, but also at odds with the proce-
dures followed for most other offences, when a decision is taken on the basis of the existence 
of leads.84 In addition, these cases place demands on shelter accommodation, which makes it 
more difficult to find places for new trafficking victims.

The possibility of abuse – of a human trafficking story being fabricated in order to claim B9 
residence status – cannot be ruled out, and there are several cases that point strongly in that 
direction. Stories may be made up on the trafficker’s instruction, much in the same way as B9 
applications are sometimes orchestrated. Because it can be very difficult to identify these cases, 
it would seem more practical to refer to ‘chanceless B9 applications’ (rather than abuse) when 
describing reports filed by foreign nationals of human trafficking offences filed with few inves-
tigative leads. This is not to say, however, that there are no victims in those cases.
At the experts’ meeting organised by the BNRM, potential solutions to this problem were 
discussed. What is clear is that there is no ready-made solution. The solutions proposed 
run along two lines. On the one hand, ideas were put forward to improve the success rate

of investigations by investing in, for example, the quality of complaints. Officers could ask 
more detailed questions, try to build a bond of trust, deploy auxiliary tools and provide extra 
support. The problem of capacity would remain (or indeed worsen), but the rate of success 
might increase. Other the other hand, it was suggested that devoting too many resources to 
these cases should be avoided by raising thresholds in, for example, the B9 regulation and/
or during the investigation and prosecution. One option would be to deny B9 status to com-
plainants who provide too little information. This kind of solution could, however, harm the 
interests of genuine victims.
Alternative solutions were mentioned, including offering assistance to all trafficking vic-
tims, regardless of whether they cooperate in the investigation and prosecution. One solu-
tion, which is already being applied, is to shorten the various proceedings (those leading up 
to the decision not to prosecute as well as the objection proceedings), which will improve 
efficiency and reduce the strain on the system.

Additional research
The debate about possible solutions to these challenges is made difficult by the fact that ma-
terial information is still lacking. Additional research is needed, particularly to look at the 
two approaches discussed above. In terms of improving the quality of complaints, research 
could be done into why some reports of offences lack information. The low percentage of 
victims of human trafficking willing to press charges is also relevant and could be examined. 
In 2008, the public prosecution service commissioned a study into this subject, but at the 
time of writing the study had, unfortunately, been discontinued.
As far as ‘raising thresholds’ is concerned, the impact of such a move could be examined. By 
way of an experiment, one could select hopeless B9 applications likely to be dropped imme-
diately (on the basis of set criteria or the opinion of experts) for lack of investigative leads. 
Those cases should then be investigated very thoroughly, using all means available. Next, it 
should be established whether those cases could be solved after all (and which approach is 
the most effective). The study should also explore the possibilities of helping victims who 
fail to cooperate in the investigation.
Incidentally, the approach involving creating higher thresholds for an investigation is less 
appropriate for complaints of ‘other forms of exploitation’, which already have built-in ob-
stacles at this stage (see Chapter 12).

5.4 Continued residence after B9 status

5.4.1 Introduction

It has been known for years that many foreign victims/witnesses of human trafficking wish 
to stay on in the Netherlands after their B9 residence permit has expired.NRM3 However, data 
on the annual number of applications for post-B9 continued residence did not become avail-
able until 2006. In that year, human trafficking liaison officers (currently: gender liaison of-

ficers) at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service began manually logging the number of 
continued residence applications they received from (possible) victims of human trafficking 
or witnesses/complainants, and how many of those applications were awarded at the initial 
decision stage. As a rule, these applications are handled by the liaison officers.85

Until recently, there was no information available on proceedings on continued residence were 
conducted in practice. This is why the BNRM has studied the cases of all applications for post-
B9 continued residence registered in 2006. The study focuses on lead times, the characteristics 
of the complainants and how the applications were actually handled by the IND.
It is important to note that since 14 August 2006, various changes have been made to the rules 
on continued residence (B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines), widening the 
possibilities for victims of human trafficking to obtain continued residence status under Arti-
cle 3.52 of the Aliens Decree. These changes may explain the increased number of continued 
residence applications registered in 2007 (49 were registered, 21 of which were granted and 28 
refused) and 2008 (149 were registered, 97 of which were granted and 52 refused).

The following sections provide information on the cases reviewed (§5.5.2) and on the victims 
who applied for continued residence (§5.5.3). Section 5.5.4 looks at the distribution of the ‘bur-
den of proof’ in continued residence applications submitted on the basis of special individual 
circumstances (urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature). The link with criminal proceedings is 
discussed in §5.5. and, finally, §5.5.6 lists a number of documentary requirements.

5.4.2 Case studies

According to the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, its human trafficking liaison offic-
ers received 34 applications for continued residence in 2006, half of which (17) were granted 
and half were refused at the initial stage. The IND had no data available on the number of 
objections or appeals filed and what the outcomes of those proceedings were. At the time of 
writing of the sixth report of the NRM, the IND was still unable to supply additional statis-
tics on the number of applications for and grants of continued residence for, for example, 
2007.
The 34 cases were reviewed from November 2007 until June 2008. It emerged that, in 2006, 
only 14 people had applied for continued residence after expiry of their B9 residence status. 
In 18 other cases, applications had been received by the IND in a different year. Not all of the 
applications were first-time applications for continued residence. As far as can be inferred 
from the files, two cases did not involve applications for continued residence. This is why 
several of the tables below show a total of 32 instead of 34.86

85 The possibility cannot be ruled that one or two applications were handled by other public servants and were 
not registered.

86 Review of all 34 cases showed that on some points – relating to the application for continued residence – only 
32 were relevant.

At the time of the study, out of the 32 applications received, 20 had resulted in the granting of 
a permit for continued residence for a period of five years.87 Eight applications were refused, 
but the time limit for filing an objection or appeal had not yet run out. Four applications were 
finally refused, one in a decision in primo,88 two in a decision handed down after an objection 
was filed89 and one on appeal.90 So it is not true that half of the 34 applications for continued 
residence were granted at the initial decision stage, as stated in the fifth and sixth reports of 
the NRM on the basis of information supplied by the IND. Table 5.7 shows the number of 
applications awarded according to the stage of the proceedings.

87 In one case, the permit for continued residence was granted for five years and immediately extended by three 
years.

88 In this particular case, an objection was filed and then withdrawn by the applicant after she had agreed with 
the IND that she would apply for asylum. The asylum application was granted at the initial decision stage. 

89 A woman filed an appeal after her objection to the denial of continued residence had been declared unfound-
ed, but went back to her home country under an IOM repatriation programme. The other file is unclear 
about what happened after the objection was declared unfounded on 2 February 2006.

90 After the continued residence proceedings had gone before the Dutch Council of State and the appeal had 
been dismissed, the alien applied for a residence permit to undergo medical treatment.

A review of each individual file, however, shows that the actual proceedings were often more 
complicated than suggested by the table above. For example, in three cases, an objection was 
filed against the granting of the application because the continued residence permit was issued 
with effect from 14 August 2006 (when the amended policy came into force) causing a ‘resi-
dence gap’ for the applicant.91 One such objection to the commencement date was declared un-
founded; that particular file is counted as an application granted at the initial decision stage. Two 
objections were awarded; those files have been classified as decisions on objection.
It was possible to trace the final outcome of the post-B9 proceedings for continued residence 
in 24 cases (20 granted, four refused). The table below shows how much time passed be-
tween the application and the outcome.

All 20 permits were issued with retrospective effect. Because of the lengthy proceedings, 11 
of these 20 permits took effect more than a year earlier. Table 5.9 shows the amount of time

B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

185

The following case study illustrates the lengthy proceedings that can be involved when con-
tinued residence is granted in a decision on an objection.

A woman from Russia claimed she had arrived in the Netherlands in May 2001. She was granted 
a B9 permit from November 2001 until November 2004.92 On 18 January 2005, she applied for 
continued residence. On 30 August 2005, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service refused 
the application, and the woman then filed an objection on 28 September 2005. The objection 
was discussed at a hearing on 30 November 2005. In mid-February 2006, the IND declared the 
objection unfounded. The woman filed an appeal in the district court, requesting an injunction 
to have her deportation postponed pending the appeal. Then, on 15 June 2006, the IND with-
drew its decision on the objection, allowing the appeal and requesting that the injunction be 
withdrawn. Eventually, on 26 June 2006, the IND again decided on the objection of 28 Septem-
ber 2005, this time declaring it to be sound. On the basis of the known facts and circumstances 
of the case, the IND ruled that the women could not be required to return to her home country. 
She was granted a permit for continued residence from 18 January 2005 until 18 January 2010.

As the Minister wrote in a letter to the Lower House of Parliament on 14 August 2006,93 
these are labour-intensive cases that often involve proceedings that create uncertainties for 
victims in terms of how long they will be allowed to stay in the country, while the criminal 
proceedings, although also lengthy in nature, have usually already been dealt with.94 Due to 
the length of these proceedings, several of the 34 files reviewed had been dealt with at some 
point on the basis of the policy as amended on 14 August 2006 (whether or not in anticipa-
tion of the amendment). In one or two files, the alien’s lengthy stay was due partly to pro-
cedural errors made by the IND, which was considered in the decision to grant continued 
residence, as in the following case:

On 4 November 2002, a woman from Cameroon reported a case of human trafficking, which 
was treated as a B9 application in accordance with the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines. 
On 22 November 2002, B9 residence status was granted, effective 4 November 2002. On 22 Au-
gust 2003, proceedings commenced to renew the B9 permit. When the woman’s application was 
dismissed in those proceedings in mid-July 2004, she applied for continued residence on 25 Au-
gust 2004. The application was refused on 20 December 2005, after which she filed an objection 
in early January 2006. The objection was dismissed for procedural reasons on 21 March 2006. 
Subsequently, on 18 July 2006, the IND wrtoe to the woman’s lawyer saying that it had become 
clear that the application of 25 August 2004 had been wrongly refused. The woman was allowed 
to make a fresh application. She did so on 16 November 2006. The application was refused on 26 
February 2007. An objection was filed in March 2007, and a hearing held in July 2007. Finally, on 
22 August 2007, the woman learned that she would be granted continued residence. The permit 
was issued with effect from 16 November 2006 and would run until 16 November 2011.

92 The fact that she was a cooperating victim and had held B9 residence status for three years would be suf-
ficient grounds for granting continued residence under the current policy rules. See §5.2.2.

When the files were being reviewed, 10 people were involved in proceedings unrelated to 
post-B9 continued residence. These were cases involving naturalisation (four), B9 renewal 
(two), under-age children staying with their mother (one), a permit to stay for medical treat-
ment (one), obtaining a W2 document (one), and asylum (one). One woman returned to her 
home country voluntarily, with the help of IOM, withdrawing her appeal in the continued 
residence proceedings.

Although victims of human trafficking can apply for residence in many other countries, pro-
ceedings there may be equally protracted. British NGOs reviewed this issue in the UK.

Victims’ right to stay in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom has no rules similar to Chapter B16/7 of the Dutch Aliens Act Implementa-
tion Guidelines. Victims from outside the EU who do not want to go back to their home country 
may apply either for asylum or for a permit under the UK Human Rights Act. Two British NGOs 
investigated the outcomes of asylum applications made by clients in 2007 (Poppy Project & Asy-
lum Aid, 2008). There were 25 women, eight of whom claimed asylum while in detention. At the 
time of writing, decisions had been made on 12 of the 25 claims; they were all refused. All of the 
women involved lodged an appeal, with eight victims being granted a residence permit by the 
court. The Home Office appealed in two of these eight cases. The remaining four cases were still 
ongoing. Although based on a small number of cases, the study shows that in the UK victims have 
to go to court to obtain the right to stay. This prolongs the uncertainty for victims and wastes 
public funds. The period from March 2003 until August 2005 showed the same pattern: of the 
32 women who claimed asylum during that period, only one was granted asylum prior to appeal. 
However, the remaining women had a success rate at the appeal stage six times higher than the 
overall acceptance rate of asylum appeals. See Poppy Project (PP) & Asylum Aid, Good inten-
tions: A review of the New Asylum Model and its impact on trafficked women claiming asylum, 2008.

5.4.3 Victims who apply for continued residence

All 34 cases reviewed for the NRM report involved women trafficked for sexual exploitation. 
Most of the victims that were registered in 2006 and applied for continued residence came 
from Bulgaria, followed by Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The 34 victims came from a total of 13 
different countries.

As far as can be inferred from the files, of the 32 women, 18 had children. The cases involved 
a total of 28 children, all of whom were minors. Some of them were born in the Netherlands, 
others came to the Netherlands at a later stage, and still others lived in their home country.

Of the 24 women, 20 suffered and were being treated for mental health problems, as evidenced 
by statements from a GP, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, the IND’s Medical Advice Bureau 
(BMA), and the Centre for Asylum Seekers with Mental Health Problems (MAPP)97. These 
included a variety of often-serious problems, including suicidal tendencies, paranoia, chronic 
depression, reliving of experiences, nightmares and other sleeping disorders. Several files con-
tained information about other health problems, such as gynaecological problems and seropos-
itive/HIV infections, with two cases involving addiction. Medical practitioners often highlight 
the causal connection between mental and physical health problems and past experiences, refer-
ring to the sexual exploitation of victims. In one case, a victim was diagnosed by a psychiatrist 
as “predominantly socialised as a slave” rather than being mentally handicapped. In other cases, 
the problems were described as being mainly a response to the uncertainty about being allowed 
to stay in the Netherlands or having to return to her country of origin.98

97 Those cases in which only the women or their lawyers reported mental health problems are not included. 
The same applies to the case in which a statement to that effect was made by a social worker, and the case 
in which a psychiatrist stated that the complaints described by Nidos were consistent with what one would 
expect given the client’s history and that a psychiatric examination was required.

(2003), Sent (2008), Tankink (2006), and Zimmerman (2006)

Special involvement of IND staff with victims of human trafficking
In a few cases, decision-makers in the Immigration and Naturalisation Service made a special 
effort to help victims of human trafficking who were in a particularly difficult situation. Three 
examples:

 – A victim addicted to drugs had been living rough for some time. During that time, her B9 
permit expired and she failed to apply for a renewal on time. Once she had been traced, had 
kicked her habit and cooperated in the investigation and prosecution, she was again granted 
B9 status.

 – A near-term pregnant woman filed a report of human trafficking and was granted a B9 per-
mit. A few months later, the IND staff member and a detective working on the case inquired 
whether she had given birth and reminded her of the fact that she would need to apply for a 
residence permit for her child.

 – A victim had been granted post-B9 continued residence status. The IND staff member in-
formed the victim’s lawyer that she was handling the case of the trafficker, who was also the 
victim’s ex-partner, in connection with a declaration as persona non grata. She advised the 
victim’s lawyer to notify the victim and the shelter where she was staying with a view to her 
personal safety.

5.4.4 Urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature

Of the 32 applications for continued residence investigated, 27 dated back to before 14 Au-
gust 2006, when the policy rules were amended (see §5.2.2 in this chapter), while the final 
decisions on those applications were often issued after that date.99 This section focuses on 
the distribution of the ‘burden of proof’ in applications for continued residence based on 
special individual circumstances. The issues addressed below are currently only relevant for 
the ‘residual category’ of victims who cannot be grouped into one of the two categories re-
ferred to above, and for witnesses/complainants.

Distribution of ‘burden of proof’
Article 3.52 of the Aliens Decree gives wide discretionary powers to the Minister in regard to 
applications for continued residence that are based on special individual circumstances. It is 
up to victims to present a prima facie case that they cannot be required to leave the Nether-
lands. In practice, this means that the burden of proof largely rests on the victim. However, 
it is not easy to substantiate this type of application.NRM5 The relevant agencies are aware 
of this, and in 2005 the chain partners agreed to assemble relevant information about each 
victim in an individual safety file. It is noticeable that in none of the cases studied had a safety 
file been compiled or inserted in the case file.
The government has a general duty of care and must gather the necessary information about 
the relevant facts and consider the various interests involved when preparing its decisions. 
From a human rights perspective, the government may not return victims of human traffick-

99 Of the 14 applications made in 2006, only five were dated after 14 August. Accordingly, there seemed to be 
no increase in the number of applications in the first few months (up to and including 31 December 2006) 
after the policy rules were relaxed.

ing to their home country if to do so would threaten their safety.100 This implies that before 
making any such decision, the government must ensure that a proper risk analysis is con-
ducted.NRM3/NRM5

Of the 32 continued residence cases studied, 28 victims indicated that they and/or their family 
members might face reprisals from which the authorities in their home country could not or 
would not protect them. Sixteen victims also stated there were no possibilities for social reinte-
gration in their home country. Fear of prosecution was cited much less frequently (two cases). 
In 20 cases, victims also described other factors, which included health complaints, the right 
to family life, the rights of their children, their long-term stay in the Netherlands and asylum-
related grounds, such as fear of sexual violence by (former) rebels in their home country.

Other circumstances 20

The cases studied confirm that many of the victims who say they cannot return for one or 
more of these reasons subsequently have difficulty furnishing evidence. This is because of 
the requirements set by the IND for substantiating their applications. In the case of a Russian 
victim,101 for example, the IND held that she had failed to present a prima facie case, because 
she had not yet contacted the authorities in her home country to ask for protection. Accord-
ing to her lawyer, however, the victim’s duty to make a reasonable effort to demonstrate the 
risks involved in returning to her home country was given too broad an interpretation, in 
that the traffickers apparently had contact with the authorities, and because the government 
itself should, to some extent, investigate the victim’s allegations. This rarely seems to hap-
pen. No individual background reports are drawn up in continued-residence cases involving 
victims of human trafficking (Koopsen, 2006), and the current study shows that the IND’s 
own efforts to conduct a risk analysis are restricted to responding to the information sup-

100 See, for example, Article 16 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings (2005), Article 3 of the ECHR, and Article 3 of the ICCPR. 

101 This is the same case as the one discussed in the box in §5.2. This argument was used against applicants in 
several cases.

plied by the victim and referring to the (theme-based) status reports on the countries of ori-
gin.102 The following case is an example in point.

A woman from Kosovo was granted B9 residence status on 11 November 2004. The renewal 
application was denied after the Immigration and Naturalisation Service learned in January 
2006 that the suspect at the centre of the allegations made by the victim had been acquitted in 
September 2005. On 6 April 2006, the woman applied for continued residence for fear of re-
prisals, among other things. On 23 October 2006, the IND refused the application saying that 
the victim had failed to demonstrate that here fear of reprisals from her family and her pimp 
and his associates was justified, and that she had failed to sufficiently substantiate her claim 
that, being single, she would not be able to reintegrate. Nor was there any documentary evi-
dence to show that family relations had irretrievably broken down. Moreover, referring to the 
status report and a UNHCR document did not provide sufficient substantiation of the claim 
that not enough assistance would be provided in Kosovo. Similarly, the information submitted 
about foreign prostitutes in Kosovo and the penalisation of prostitution in Serbia and Mon-
tenegro did not prove that the applicant was exposed to the risk of prosecution.
In her objection, the woman argued that her Islamic relatives knew about her prostitution and 
wanted revenge because she had violated their honour. Clearly, her family had not said so in so 
many words, but her uncle had threatened her several times, which she had not dared to report 
to the police. The applicant had been abused as a child, was married off against her will when 
she was twenty, and no longer had any contact with her father and stepmother. She had two 
children and had lived with her family in Germany for a long time. She had been abused by her 
husband and then divorced, being forced to abandon her children. They now lived with her 
former mother-in-law. The applicant had been coerced into working as a prostitute in Belgium 
and the Netherlands. The violent trafficker threatened to kill her children and tried to abduct 
them after she had gone to the police. Again, the applicant did not dare to press charges. In her 
objection, she argued that she could not reasonably be expected to provide further substantia-
tion of her fear of reprisals.
The status report cited cases of women being prosecuted in Kosovo after they were released 
from prostitution. A report published by Amnesty International in November 2006 revealed 
that the UNMIK forces were unable to provide protection from human trafficking and violence 
against women. The applicant was not eligible for social security benefit, which increased the 
chances of her ending up in prostitution once again. According to Amnesty’s report, the assist-
ance provided was inadequate and the applicant did not meet the criteria that applied. These 
facts did not merely concern the general situation. The IND should consider those facts in 
reviewing the applicant’s individual situation, given the duty imposed upon the Netherlands 
under the UNHCR Guidelines, the Palermo Protocol and the findings of the UN CEDAW 
Committee to make a reasonable effort. In January 2007, additional grounds were advanced, in 
that a statement was added from the former mother-in-law saying that the applicant was not al-
lowed to visit her because local custom prevented this. It was simply not done. This confirmed 
that the applicant’s belief that she could not expect to receive any support from her former 
in-laws. In June 2007, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service interviewed the applicant 
about her last contact with her pimp, her family situation, fear of honour killing and treatment 
by the Regional Institute for Community Mental Healthcare (RIAGG).
Then, on 26 July 2007, the police notified the IND that the applicant had been moved to a shel-
ter and had reported to the South Limburg police that she had again become a victim. Again, 

102 In seven cases, the IND did conduct some form of investigation of its own accord, in that it consulted the US 
Country Report on Human Rights Practices for the country in question, or the US Trafficking in Persons Report. 

NMR Ch05.indd   191 09-06-10   00:06

she was granted B9 residence status. The file includes a newspaper report dated 1 August 2007 
about the police rounding up a ring of human traffickers after rescuing a victim who had earlier 
gone into hiding with the help of the police but had been tracked down and locked up in a house 
by the gang.
On 11 October 2007, the IND rejected the application for continued residence because the ap-
plicant had furnished no proof to justify her fear of her family, the pimp or the authorities, or in 
regard her belonging to a group of persons for whom inadequate social security was available 
in Kosovo. Regardless of the arguments advanced by the applicant in her defence, the objec-
tion was dismissed because the applicant held a B9 permit and would not become eligible for 
continued residence until her right to stay under Section 8(a) of the Aliens Act had expired.
The applicant appealed because she disagreed with the IND’s line of reasoning. From 6 April 
2006 – when she made the application – until 26 July 2007, she had had no right to stay under 
Section 8(a) of the Aliens Act. Moreover, continued residence status represented a stronger 
right than B9 residence status, which was important because her children had come to the 
Netherlands on a provisional residence permit and had applied to stay with their mother. The 
applicant argued that her fear of reprisals was supported by the report of 26 July 2007 and the 
fact that the police had advised her not to go to Maastricht because associates of her pimp were 
there. They had previously threatened her children in Kosovo, which was one of the reasons 
for recommending the granting of a provisional residence permit to protect the children. It was 
also clear from the proceedings for the provisional residence permit that, for safety reasons, 
the Dutch police had decided against contacting the Yugoslav authorities when the children 
were still in Kosovo. Continued residence should have been granted either for urgent reasons 
of a humanitarian nature or under the hardship clause contained in Article 4:84 of the General 
Administrative Law Act.
In April 2008, the IND withdrew its decision on the objection. According to the file, this was 
because they had to examine why a B9 permit had been granted twice, without looking at 
whether the application for continued residence should have been granted at that point. At the 
time of the study, the outcome was not yet known.

At the time of the study, the 32 applications had led to 20 permits being granted for continued 
residence, the vast majority of them on objection. The decisions provided very limited infor-
mation as to the grounds on which the IND had granted continued residence. Of the 20 deci-
sions, 15 merely stated that continued residence had been granted ‘on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances currently known’. Four permits were granted referring to the outcome of the 
criminal proceedings: on the basis of the victim’s report, the suspect had been prosecuted for 
and convicted of human trafficking (among other things), so the presumption was that any re-
turn would involve risks for the victim (revised policy, ground (a)). One decision contained the 
substantive finding that the applicant could not be expected to return because of the risk of end-
ing up in prostitution in Sierra Leone and becoming the victim of violence.

Medical factors
In reviewing applications for continued residence based on special individual circumstances, 
the authorities not only look at the risk of reprisals, risk of prosecution and possibilities 
for social reintegration in the country of origin, other factors may also be relevant. The Al-
iens Act Implementation Guidelines now include, for example, mental-health problems for 

NMR Ch05.indd   192 09-06-10   00:06



B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

193

which aliens are receiving treatment in the Netherlands. Because trafficking victims often 
have serious health problems (§5.3), it is important for health problems and medical treat-
ment to be taken into consideration.
This argument was advanced by victims in several cases, with varying results. In one case, 
the district court found that, although the respondent had assessed the application for con-
tinued residence against the three factors listed in the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 
at that time, the respondent had disregarded the circumstance that the victim was suffering 
from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by forced prostitution and the related kidnap-
ping of her small son. In reviewing the application, the respondent should have taken the 
reported mental-health problems into account and this should have been reflected in its de-
cision.103 The same issue lay at the heart of the following case:

A woman from Sierra Leone obtained a B9 permit effective 5 January 2006. Later that year, the 
IND indicated that they would revoke the permit because the investigation into the allegations 
made by the woman had been closed. The woman’s lawyer objected by saying, among other 
things,104 that his client was traumatised and, as shown in BMA reports, there was no proper 
medical care available in Sierra Leone. He was assuming the IND would ex officio review the 
application for continued residence now that it had revoked the permit. A hearing was held to 
discuss, among other things, the diagnosis made by a psychiatrist. The applicant suffered from 
PTSD with acute exacerbations, periods of memory loss, and fluctuating suicidal tendencies. 
The B9 permit was revoked. To the extent that the application relied on medical grounds, the 
IND ruled that she could apply for a permit intended for that purpose. The same applied to 
her claim of residence for urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature. The arguments advanced 
were not reviewed ex officio during the revocation proceedings. The applicant applied for a B9 
renewal, which was refused.
In the objection to the revocation and refusal to renew the permit, the woman’s lawyer argued 
that the Minister could have exercised his discretionary powers and granted a permit, and that 
the B9 application could be reviewed against Article 4:84 of the General Administrative Law 
Act. The objection was dismissed. The decision stated that a permit for continued residence 
or medical treatment could not be granted ex officio, and applications were tested against only 
one residence purpose at a time. Accordingly, the challenged decisions had not been reviewed 
against the other residence purposes listed by the applicant. Also, all of the arguments were 
embedded in the policy and, accordingly, there was no reason to award residence in departure 
from the policy.
The woman applied for continued residence for urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature, in-
cluding the absence of proper psychiatric care in Sierra Leone. The application was refused. In 
the IND’s opinion, the argument that the woman had no access to medical care in Sierra Leone 
was not explained in sufficient detail, specifically concerned with her personal situation, and 
was neither proved nor substantiated. The enclosed BMA report did not concern the applicant 
and was not up to date. Again, the IND concluded that if the applicant believed she was eligible 
for residence on medical grounds, she could submit an application to that effect. The IND held 
that no proof had been furnished of any urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature which justi-

fear of becoming once again involved in prostitution, and her fear of the female-circumcision practices fol-

fied granting residence, or of any special circumstances which, on the basis of Article 4:84 of 
the General Administrative Law Act, required deviating from the policy.
In the objection subsequently filed, the woman’s lawyer submitted a recent BMA statement to 
show that no adequate treatment of psychiatric patients was available in Sierra Leone, and that 
that included treatment for the applicant. He also argued that the status report made no men-
tion of assistance being provided for single mothers requiring psychiatric help in Sierra Leone. 
He referred to the UK Government’s Country of origin information report on Sierra Leone: there 
was only one run-down psychiatric hospital, one psychiatrist and one psychiatric nurse in the 
whole of Sierra Leone. In July 2007, the lawyer filed an appeal against the absence of a decision 
on the objection. There followed a hearing, during which a new medical statement was submit-
ted. According to the psychiatrist, repatriation would be extremely ill-advised. It would increase 
the complaints of depression and he was concerned about the impact any return would have on 
her suicidal ideation. The lawyer argued that a careful review of the interests involved should 
include all humanitarian aspects, including the health problems arising from what happened to 
the applicant in the Netherlands. If need be, she should be granted a permit on the grounds of 
a medical emergency. In November 2007, the IND upheld the objection and granted continued 
residence on the basis of the facts and circumstances then known. This case study shows that 
the medical consequences of human trafficking were taken into consideration.

The question of whether the current rules on continued residence do sufficient justice to the 
physical and mental harm often caused by human trafficking was addressed in 2008, in a 
report of a forensic medical study involving human trafficking (Sent, 2008).

Medical consequences of human trafficking and continued residence
Sent (2008)105 explains that in reviewing applications for continued residence on humanitarian 
grounds, medical circumstances can currently only be considered as one of the other factors to 
be weighed. Medical circumstances are not regarded as independent personal circumstances 
as defined in Section 3.52 of the Aliens Decree, and continued residence cannot be granted on 
purely medical grounds. That is where ‘medical treatment’ comes in as a ground for awarding 
residence. According to Sent, a trafficking victim who submits medical documents when ap-
plying for continued residence should not be required to file a fresh application for a different 
residence purpose based on the same circumstances.
Moreover, Sent considers the ground of ‘medical treatment’ for residence to be of little use 
to trafficking victims. Chapter B8 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines lists several 
conditions for relying on that particular ground. For example, the Netherlands must be the 
most appropriate country for treatment, the medical treatment must be necessary and financ-
ing must have been arranged. According to Sent, the authorities are not quick to find the Neth-
erlands to be the most appropriate country, except perhaps for psychiatric treatment. This is 
relevant because trafficking victims are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disor-
der (Zimmerman, 2006). It does not alter the fact, however, that receiving treatment is not in 
itself a reason for victims to wish to stay in the Netherlands, but rather a circumstance arising 
from the situation in which they find themselves (LJN: BB6829).
If, in the absence of treatment, the disorder is likely to result in death or severe mental or physi-
cal harm in the short term, and if no treatment is available in the country of origin, and if the 
treatment is expected to take more than a year, residence may be granted on the grounds of a 

105 Sent (2008, pp. 343-349).

medical emergency. Sent mentions, as an example, active suicidal ideation, a condition that 
human trafficking victims may might suffer from.
In light of the nature and extent of the health issues involved, Sent believes it would be more ap-
propriate to regard medical circumstances as ‘urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature arising 
from human trafficking’ in their own right. This would avoid the need to file new applications, 
and would increase legal certainty.

The cases studied not only provide information about the problems involved in the distribu-
tion of the ‘burden of proof’, and the substantive review as to whether continued residence 
should be granted on humanitarian grounds, they also provide an insight into the relation-
ship between the residence proceedings and criminal proceedings and related issues.

5.4.5 Link with criminal proceedings

In all 34 cases, the (possible) victims reported a human trafficking offence. In 20 cases, the in-
vestigation into the allegations was discontinued at some point, whether or not followed by 
a formal decision not to prosecute. Nine complainants filed an objection against this under 
Article 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure. One objection was upheld by the court 
of appeal, seven cases were unsuccessful106, and in one case, the outcome of the objection 
could not yet be inferred from the IND file. The average duration of objection proceedings 
was 12 months (see also §5.4.2).
In 20 cases, the report of human trafficking did not result in a decision by a criminal court. 
Of the remaining 14 cases, 10 led to convictions for human trafficking committed against the 
complainants. Table 5.15 provides information from IND files about the outcomes of crimi-
nal cases at first instance.

106 In one case, the court of appeal commented that it could imagine that this was a disappointing outcome for 
the applicant. She had reported abuse, unlawful detention and human trafficking (forced prostitution in a 
street-walking zone). According to the court of appeal, the prostitution could be assumed to be established 
and the police suspected that the woman was referring to persons known to the police in connection with 
human trafficking. A year later, one of the suspects, whom the applicant had not in fact identified, was pros-
ecuted and convicted of human trafficking, but not of the offences committed against her.

There was insufficient information in the files to indicate whether these were irrevocable 
acquittals and convictions.
At the time of the study, nine files stated that the decision was irrevocable. In two of four 
cases that failed to result in a conviction for human trafficking offences committed against 
the complainants, the district court did convict one suspect for embezzlement of money 
earned by the complainant working as a prostitute, and the other suspect was convicted for 
human trafficking against another woman. With effect from 23 February 2008, a permit for 
continued residence may also be awarded if the criminal case in which the victim cooperated 
has resulted in an irrevocable conviction for another offence, provided that human traffick-
ing was included as a charge in the indictmentNRM6.107

Eighteen cases clearly show that problems often occur in the communication between the 
IND, the police, the public prosecution service and the alien involved about the progress 
and/or outcome of the investigation or the prosecution and the trial.108 Under the B9 regu-
lation, the public prosecution service must notify the IND and the victim if it has dropped 
the case, no appeal has been filed against the district court’s decision in the case against the 
suspect, or the court of appeal has rendered a decision.109 This is because each of these events 
removes the legal basis for the B9 permit. In practice, however, the B9 regulation is not al-
ways properly followed because, for example, the IND is not notified, or notified in time, that 
the decision in a criminal case has become final and irrevocable or that an objection has been 
filed against its decision. It has been known to happen that trafficking victims who have been 
staying on a B9 residence permit status for several years subsequently learned from an IND 
decision that the suspect against whom they had pressed charges had been convicted years 
before. This can happen, for example, when proceedings to confiscate illegal earnings are 
mixed up with the trial for human trafficking.110

A Russian woman obtained a B9 permit on 30 June 2000. She applied for a renewal on time, 
but also submitted an application for continued residence on 21 August 2001, because her law-
yer had learned from the public prosecution service that the decision in the criminal case had 
become irrevocable. On 7 August 2002, the IND extended the B9 permit from 30 June 2001 to 
29 June 2003, while refusing the application for continued residence on the grounds that one 

107 In the first of the two cases referred to, the IND followed a similar line of reasoning when, on 9 November 
2007, in its decision on the objection, it found that although the suspect had been prosecuted for but not 
convicted of human trafficking, the conviction for embezzlement was clearly related to the human traffick-
ing offence reported by the applicant. This rendered her fear of reprisals plausible. Another important factor 
was that her name had been revealed in the ruling of the criminal court. In the other case, this line of reason-
ing was not followed and continued residence was denied. The applicant was again granted B9 status after a 
second suspect had been arrested.

108 Especially if the alien presses charges against various suspects and the prosecution has different outcomes.
109 With effect from 2 June 2008, a B9 permit is not only valid for the duration of the investigation, prosecution 

and trial at first instance, but also for the duration of any adjudication of the criminal case by the Supreme 
Court, following the court of appeal’s decision. See §5.2.1.

110 The suspect’s adjudication comes to an end once the criminal court’s decision in the trafficking case has be-
come final and irrevocable. This holds true even if the order to pay a sum of money to the State to confiscate 
unlawful earnings has not yet become final (Dutch Council of State, 8 October 2007, LJN: BB5765).

suspect had allegedly filed an appeal. The residence permit was subsequently renewed until 17 
May 2004. A renewal application dated 16 March 2004 was refused on 9 June 2005, because 
information from the public prosecution service dated 19 May 2005 showed that the decision 
in the criminal case had become irrevocable on 23 May 2001, after the suspect had abandoned 
the appeal against his conviction of 18 December 2000 and sentence of four years’ impris-
onment. The B9 renewals in 2002 and 2003 were based on an incorrect interpretation of the 
information from the public prosecution service concerning an appeal against a confiscation 
order, which was something quite separate from the trial for human trafficking. The victim 
filed an objection. Her lawyer argued that the prolonged duration of her stay in the Netherlands 
under the B9 regulation was not based merely on an incorrect interpretation of information 
from the public prosecution service but had also been the result of the slow handling of her 
case by the IND. On 8 December 2005, the objection was dismissed on the grounds that the 
fact that there was no investigation, prosecution or trial at first instance ongoing had not been 
disputed. On 11 August 2005, pending the objection proceedings, the woman again applied for 
continued residence. On 12 January 2006, the IND wrote that the application had been filed 
too late, which revived the requirement of having a provisional residence permit. The lawyer 
responded by saying that, under the B9 regulation, the public prosecution service must notify 
the IND and the victim when the decision is made not to prosecute, no appeal is filed with the 
district court, or the court of appeal has rendered a decision, all of which would deprive the 
residence permit of its legal basis. The applicant had received no such notification. It was not 
until the decision of 9 June 2005 that she learned that the decision in the criminal case in which 
she was a victim had become irrevocable in May 2001. In that decision, the IND noted that they 
had also not received the information from the public prosecution service until 19 May 2005. 
Because the applicant did not receive the notification until 10 June 2005, she was not at fault for 
filing the application late. On 8 February 2006, the application was refused on the grounds that 
it had not been demonstrated that the applicant should not be required to return to her home 
country. An objection was filed on 10 March 2006 and amended on 29 March 2006. A hearing 
was held on 16 June 2006. On objection, the lawyer asserted that his client had made a witness 
statement during a hearing before the court of appeal in the case against the suspect as late as 8 
March 2006. On 20 June 2006, in a decision on the objection, continued residence was granted 
from 11 August 2005 until 1 February 2010. The earlier summons to come forward as a witness 
had been taken into consideration (the IND felt it was likely that the traffickers would not for-
get the applicant once she had made a statement; moreover, the applicant would be eligible for 
continued residence under the pending amendment to the policy rules anyway).

In 10 of the 34 cases, the decision not to prosecute and the possibility of filing an objection 
against that decision were not properly communicated.111 To give an example:

In April 2005, a Chinese woman made allegations of human trafficking. The report was treated 
as a B9 application and refused on 21 September. The objection filed on 19 October was upheld 
on 1 December, on the grounds that the woman had not been advised of the possibility of com-
mencing Article 12 proceedings. In January 2006, the application was again refused because 
the applicant did not satisfy the conditions. Information from the public prosecution service 
and the police dated 20 and 21 September 2005 showed that, on 30 June, the decision had been 
made not to launch a criminal investigation, and the applicant had not filed an objection under 

111 See §5.4.

198

Article 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure. In the objection to this refusal, the ap-
plicant’s lawyer argued that previously his client had satisfied the conditions and that it was 
in her interests to be granted a permit for that period – when she had satisfied the conditions 
– so as to be able to apply for continued residence on humanitarian grounds. The objection 
was dismissed for procedural reasons on 22 March 2006, and the woman filed an appeal on 14 
April 2006. She was notified that she could stay in the shelter because of her residence status 
until 27 September 2006 at the latest. This gave her lawyer cause to ask the district court for 
early adjudication of the case. On 24 August 2006, the IND wrote that the decision in January 
should be regarded as a decision on an objection and had been withdrawn, that the objection 
should be regarded as an appeal, and that the decision on 22 March had been issued incorrectly. 
The IND would issue a new decision on the objection dated 19 October 2005. On 30 August, 
the Chinese woman nonetheless asked the district court to uphold the appeal of 14 April 2006. 
On 16 October 2006, the IND decided, after all, to grant residence from 9 April until 30 June 
2005, which is when the public prosecutor dropped the case, although the applicant’s report of 
the offence had not been faxed to the IND until 19 September 2005. A member of staff at the 
shelter was notified of the decision to drop the case and was expected to inform the applicant. 
On 1 December 2005, the woman’s lawyer was given the opportunity to file an objection under 
Article 12, which he never did. Subsequently, on 24 October 2006, the district court held that, 
although the withdrawal of the challenged decision did not prevent it from being quashed if 
that was in the appellant’s interest, no such interest had emerged. The appeal was dismissed for 
procedural reasons. On 5 January 2007, the woman applied for asylum.

A likely cause of the confusion over decisions not to prosecute is that Chapter B9 of the 
Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines mentions a period of two weeks in which applicants 
– having been notified of that decision – must notify the police whether they will be filing an 
objection with the court of appeal.112

5.4.6 Documents

Similarly, the requirement to submit certain documents and the right to be issued with a 
document also lead to complications in residence proceedings involving victims of human 
trafficking.

Passport requirement
A B9 application will not be refused if the victim does not have a passport, but she will im-
mediately need to apply for one from the embassy or consulate of her home country. When 
applying for continued residence, the applicant must submit a passport or demonstrate that 
the authorities of her home country have prevented her from holding one. In 15 of the cases 
studied, this requirement proved to be a problem for victims from Sierra Leone (five), Ni-
geria (three), Cameroon, Ukraine, North Korea, Yugoslavia, Russia, Guinea, and Namibia 
(one each). Either they had no passport or no longer had one, and were consistently rebuffed 

112 See §5.2.1.

199

by their embassy or consulate.113 The outcomes varied: in one case, it constituted a reason to 
exempt the victim from the passport requirement under discretionary powers; in another 
case, no exemption was granted.

In December 2001, a woman claiming to be from Sierra Leone reported a human trafficking of-
fence. She was issued with a B9 permit, which was renewed several times. In August 2004, the 
public prosecutor handling the case notified the police that the case had been dropped. The IND 
passed on the notification to the applicant on 27 December 2004. In February 2005, the woman 
filed an Article 12 objection and again applied for B9 renewal. On 30 January 2006, the court of 
appeal upheld the objection. On 29 May 2006, the woman applied for continued residence. On 20 
July 2006, the IND renewed the B9 permit, while refusing continued residence on the grounds of 
the passport requirement, arguing that the applicant had been given an opportunity in June and 
July 2006 to submit a valid passport or a written statement from the Sierra Leone authorities to 
show that she was unable to obtain a passport. It had been explainted to the applicant as early as 
16 January 2002 that she would not be denied B9 status for lack of a passport, but that she needed 
to apply for one immediately. The fact that B9 status had been renewed several times was no rea-
son not to apply the requirement in the proceedings for continued residence. The argument that 
people from Sierra Leone could not obtain passports was refuted by the general status report of 
April 2005, and the fact that the applicant had written to the Sierra Leone authorities in March 
2005 and July 2006 to obtain a passport and had received no answer to date, did not warrant the 
conclusion that the authorities would not give her a passport. After all, she had failed to make 
inquiries afterwards and hence had not done everything reasonably within her power to obtain a 
passport. In conclusion, the woman’s identity and nationality had not been established.
In August 2006, the woman filed an objection. She took the position that she had done every-
thing within her power to obtain a passport, referring to a letter of 20 July 2006, which said 
that she was exempt from the passport requirement as far as the B9 renewal was concerned 
because of the justified expectations created by the decisions of 23 October 2003 and 25 March 
2005. She argued that the same should apply to the application for continued residence. Alter-
natively, she asked for an exemption because the authorities were uncooperative. Despite what 
it said in the status report, nationals of Sierra Leone could not apply to their embassy or con-
sulate for travel documents when they were abroad. Accordingly, contacts with the embassy 
were of no avail and a witness stated that the applicant had been sent away empty-handed by 
the embassy on 4 December 2006. The woman went on to say that the Minister could not now 
question her identity and nationality because of the absence of a passport when she had held a 
permit since 2001 without anyone ever raising any questions. On 14 September 2007, the ap-
plicant’s lawyer submitted a general statement from the embassy dated 3 April 2007 saying that 
it did not issue passports or handle applications and citizens had to go to Freetown instead.
On 10 October 2007, the IND wrote that the applicant was eligible for a residence permit on 
principle, provided that she submitted a valid passport within four weeks. If it was confirmed 
that Sierra Leone was her home country, the presumption would be that she could not go back. 
If she could not obtain a passport, she had to prove this by submitting a written statement from 
the authorities and submit additional documents to prove her identity and nationality. She 
could contact the chief constable of police to act as an intermediary in obtaining a passport. 
The applicant’s lawyer then asked the IND how his client could possibly apply for a passport 
outside Sierra Leone and what action the IND expected her to undertake. He also informed 

113 There are indications that staff from certain embassies treat victims of human trafficking unpleasantly. In 
one case, a staff member at the Humanitas aid agency stated that she had been told over the telephone that 
the embassy did not help people like her client because they were a disgrace to their country.

the IND that his client had shown the IND’s letter to the aliens police, asking them to act as a 
go-between. She was told that the aliens police provided no support in obtaining travel docu-
ments. The lawyer asked the IND where else she could go for mediation.
In its response, the IND suggested, among other things, that the lawyer should investigate 
whether the applicant’s passport, which had allegedly been taken by the human traffickers, 
could be claimed back in civil proceedings. It was the applicant’s responsibility to get hold of a 
valid passport, and she was granted another six weeks to do so. The lawyer contacted the aliens 
police and was referred to the Repatriation and Departure Service. They, in turn, said they did 
not provide intermediary services for people to obtain entry documents. On 16 January 2008, 
the lawyer informed the IND of these developments, arguing that it was clear that the appli-
cant could not obtain a passport and that travelling to Freetown or bringing a civil action went 
beyond the duty imposed under the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines. On 7 March 2008, 
the IND dismissed the objection filed in the continued residence proceedings, saying that the 
exemption based on justified expectations concerned the renewal of the B9 permit and did 
not apply to the follow-up proceedings. According to the IND, no proof had been furnished 
in the objection proceedings that the applicant was, in fact, unable to obtain a passport from 
the Sierra Leone authorities. Writing twice to the embassy, being told by the embassy that she 
could not apply for a passport there, and the statement that passports must be applied for in 
Freetown did not justify the view that the applicant could not be issued with a passport from 
her government. According to the status reports of June 2006 and November 2007, citizens of 
Sierra Leone living abroad could apply for a passport via their embassy. If, for the sake of argu-
ment, it were to be assumed that the embassy did not handle applications, the applicant could 
apply for a laissez-passer, travel to Freetown and apply for a passport there. In conclusion, the 
woman’s identity and nationality had not been established in the objection proceedings either. 
On 21 March 2008, the applicant appealed the decision on the objection. At the time of the 
study, the appeal was ongoing.

In September 2008, when asked, BLinN and a lawyer well-versed in B9 cases said that the 
passport requirement was still a sticking point in applications for continued residence, es-
pecially for victims from Sierra Leone. The only documents they could acquire from the 
Brussels embassy were individual nationality confirmations and a general statement that the 
embassy issued no passports and handled no applications; still, the IND referred to status 
reports saying that it was possible for people to obtain passports through Sierra Leone’s em-
bassies. The IND raised the issue with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in January 
2009 the General Status Report on Sierra Leone 2008 was published. Page 34 reads: “Sierra 
Leona embassies abroad have no authority to issue passports. They can renew passports and 
issue laissez-passers. Practice has shown that the procedures referred to above are not imple-
mented by all Sierra Leone embassies, including the Brussels embassy.”

Provisional residence permit
In departure from the general rule, B9 applications will not be refused for lack of a provi-
sional residence permit, nor is this a requirement for continued residence applications, pro-
vided that they are filed on time. If, however, the application for continued residence is not 
filed on time (within six months of expiration of B9 residence status), a provisional residence 
permit will be required.

B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

201

On 28 April 2000, a Nigerian woman held in aliens’ detention reported a human trafficking of-
fence. The report was treated as an application for a residence permit, which was awarded by the 
IND on 12 December 2000, after an objection had been filed to an earlier decision. The permit 
was issued with effect from 28 April 2000 and renewed twice. On 17 January 2003, the woman 
applied for a renewal. By that time, the people against whom she had made the allegations had 
already been irrevocably convicted of human trafficking. The application was refused on 31 De-
cember 2003, an objection was filed, the objection was dismissed on 19 October 2005, and an 
appeal was lodged. Meanwhile, on 11 January 2006, the woman applied for continued residence. 
This was refused on 10 March 2006 because the application had not been filed on time and the 
applicant had no provisional residence permit. In her objection, the applicant argued that the 
delay in meeting the time limit was excusable and the grounds for granting an exemption from 
the requirement for a provisional permit had been given too restrictive an interpretation, con-
sidering that she had been the victim of human traffickers who had been irrevocably convicted 
and deported to her home country, where they were threatening members of her family. She also 
referred to the passage about human trafficking in the general status report on Nigeria.
In August 2006, a hearing was held to discuss the objection. The public service committee asked 
the woman why she could not travel to Nigeria to apply for a provisional residence permit. She 
explained that she feared reprisals by one of the traffickers, who after completing her prison 
term had returned to Nigeria and had repeatedly threatened and abused the applicant’s sister 
and niece, and provided documentary evidence in support of that claim. On 2 November 2006, 
the objection was upheld. Under Article 3.52 of the Aliens Decree, continued residence was 
granted from 31 August 2006 until 31 August 2011. The IND found that there was a likely risk of 
reprisals on the woman’s return to her home country and granted the applicant an exemption 
from the provisional permit requirement on the grounds of hardship. The permit commenced 
on the date a copy of a valid passport was submitted, so all requirements were satisfied. In con-
nection with a three-year residence gap, the victim persisted in her appeal against the refusal to 
renew her B9 permit. Proceedings went all the way to the Dutch Council of State, where the 
State Secretary’s appeal was successful and the victim’s appeal against the decision to deny her 
objection was dismissed.

A Nigerian woman held B9 residence status from 12 December 2000 until 12 December 2001. 
The suspects against whom she had pressed charges were convicted during that year. Thereafter, 
the woman was staying in the Netherlands illegally. She did not apply for continued residence 
and received notification in 2004 that she had to leave the country. This she did not do. In April 
2005, she asked the Minister for Immigration and Integration to exercise her discretionary pow-
er and grant her a residence permit, but without success. In early October 2006, she applied for 
continued residence while being held in aliens’ detention. Her lawyer argued that she could not 
be held responsible for the delayed application and should be exempted from the requirement 
of a provisional residence permit due to the special circumstances of the case, which included 
a homeless existence after leaving her violent partner. The IND regarded these arguments as 
insufficient substantiation of the request for exemption from the requirement of a provisional 
residence permit and denied the application for lack of a provisional residence permit.
The detention continued. The woman filed an objection to the refusal, asking that she be al-
lowed to await the outcome of the decision in the Netherlands. In the objection proceedings, 
her lawyer referred to the principle underlying the revised policy on post-B9 continued resi-
dence, which said that if the charges led to a conviction, there was a presumption in law that 
any return would involve risks for the victim. His client fell into this category and it was a policy

violation to require that she return to her home country to apply for a provisional residence 
permit there. On 24 January 2007, the IND said in its defence that it did not object to pre-
liminary relief being awarded, but it did not want to release the applicant and did not have to 
release her until four weeks after the court had awarded the relief. The next day, the applicant 
appealed against her continued detention. On 5 February, the court awarded preliminary re-
lief, ordering the respondent to refrain from making or preparing for any decision to remove 
or deport the woman until a decision on the objection had been rendered. Four days later, the 
district court held that since 24 January 2007 the detention had been unlawful and must be 
lifted. The court held that the respondent had acted in violation of the principle of fair play 
and had failed to act expeditiously, allowing almost three months to pass before saying that it 
did not object to the preliminary relief. The respondent had indicated that the applicant could 
stay in the Netherlands pending the decision on the objection and this constituted grounds to 
terminate the detention and award damages.
On 11 July 2007, a decision on the objection was issued. The IND issued the applicant with a 
permit for continued residence from 2 October 2006 until 2 October 2011, exempting her from 
the requirement of a provisional residence permit on the grounds of hardship. In arriving at 
this decision, the IND had attached weight to the information supplied by the officer heading 
the criminal investigation that the applicant had played an important part in the investigation.

W2 document
In March 2007, the National Ombudsman published a report entitled ‘Bewijs maar wie je 
bent. De afgifte van identiteitsdocumenten (W2) door de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedi-
enst’ (2007/060), after receiving complaints that the general duty to produce identification 
was causing problems for people with no identity papers, including aliens who were allowed 
to stay in the Netherlands pending a decision on their residence application. The ombuds-
man also specifically referred to victims of human trafficking. The so called W2 document 
had been intended to resolve this problem for several categories of aliens; however, the om-
budsman recommended that all legal aliens staying in the Netherlands with no passport 
should be issued with a W2 document in regular proceedings. He warned that, in particular, 
former asylum seekers who had submitted a regular application risked losing out. As far as 
this group of aliens was concerned, the State Secretary adopted the recommendation.114

In at least two of the cases studied, there had been problems with the issuing of a W2 docu-
ment. It would seem, however, that issuing W2 documents to victims of human trafficking 
is no longer a problem.115 Inquiries with BLinN and a lawyer who often handles B9 cases 
indicated that victims staying legally are usually issued with a W2 document, even after expi-
ration of the reflection period,116 on the grounds of special circumstances, with no litigation 
being necessary.

5.5 Conclusions

This section summarises the sticking points encountered in relation to the issues discussed 
in this chapter, and highlights the areas where improvement is needed.

Clarity about the B9 regulation and associated arrangements
The B9 regulation confers rights not only on the victims of exploitation in the sex industry, 
but also on victims of exploitation in other sectors. However, as regards the identifica-
tion of victims of ‘other forms of exploitation’, the regulation was not very clear. In April 
2009, the relevant passages were clarified without revising the policy. This is a significant 
improvement. Government agencies do not always seem to be able to recognise signs of 
human trafficking, particularly when it comes to exploitation in sectors other than the sex 
industry, and do not always know how to apply the B9 regulation. It should be clear that 
not only the police and special investigation agencies, but also the Labour Inspectorate, 
must immediately inform aliens of their rights under the B9 regulation when they discov-
er illegal immigrants in a workplace. In addition, the Instruction on Human Trafficking, 
which is intended for the police and public prosecution service, says that victims of human 
trafficking must be reported to the Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMen-
sha) in order to arrange shelter and coordinate care. However, it should also be clear to 
other agencies, such as the Labour Inspectorate and the SIOD, that they too must report 
victims to CoMensha and what the procedure is for doing so. The B9 regulation recom-
mends that in preparing for a worksite immigration raid, the police should explicitly focus 
on human trafficking, and preparations should be made to provide assistance for possible 
human trafficking victims. This can be done by contacting CoMensha prior to the raid. 
This information is, however, missing from the public prosecution service’s Instruction 
on Human Trafficking.
To avoid any misunderstanding on this point, it must be clear that all government agencies 
must report all victims of all types of human trafficking to CoMensha. In other words:

 – not only the police and public prosecution service must report victims, but also all other 
agencies involved;

 – not only victims of sexual exploitation must be reported, but also victims of other forms 
of exploitation;

 – not only aliens must be reported, but also Dutch victims.

It is of vital importance that all government agencies involved are familiar with the rules and as-
sociated arrangements, and that they pursue the same policy. Clearly, there has to be agreement 
on which government agency is responsible for (possible) victims. This can be achieved through 
firm agreements in which tasks, powers, and responsibilities are clearly allocated.
Sometimes there is also confusion about the differences between victims and witnesses/
complainants in the B9 regulation. An example is the confusion over the length of time the 
IND has to decide on a residence application.

204

There is regular overlap between criminal law and immigration law, but there is a serious gap 
in knowledge of the other area of law among practitioners in each of these domains.

‘Chanceless’ B9 applications
There are victims who provide so little information when reporting an offence that the case 
cannot be solved. The police and public prosecution service devote a lot of resources to these 
complaints because every human trafficking case must be looked into. There is a suspicion 
that some individuals who are not actually victims seize on the B9 regulation as a last resort 
to secure residence. Every complaint must be treated with care, because, quite simply, it is 
so often difficult to recognise victims. There is no ready-made solution to the problem of 
balancing the need to consider the justified interests of genuine victims, on the one hand, and 
to prevent unlawful use of the regulation and unnecessary strain on resources and facilities 
for shelter and assistance, on the other. What could prove very useful would be to explore all 
of the circumstances surrounding the reporting of an offence in more detail. In that context, 
it is regrettable that the public prosecution service’s research department (WBOM) has dis-
continued the study ‘Human Trafficking: Chain, Victim and Knowledge Perspective’. The 
public prosecution service has done the right thing by drawing up a practical plan describing 
precisely what has to be done at each step of the process, from the time of an informal inter-
view to the decision not to prosecute or to investigate the case further.
The introduction of shelter for specific categories of victims and arranging provision of ade-
quate legal assistance can be expected to increase the willingness of victims to report offences.

Linking of residence status to reporting of offence/cooperation in criminal proceedings
Granting a (temporary) residence permit to victims and witnesses of human trafficking is 
currently conditional upon their cooperation in a criminal investigation.
Aliens are informed that they can report an offence or otherwise cooperate in the investiga-
tion immediately, but that under the B9 regulation they can also do so after a period of reflec-
tion, during which they have up to three months to calmly consider their decision.
It is important to make a distinction between the likelihood of a prosecution for human traf-
ficking being successful, and the possibility that a person is a victim of human trafficking. 
Even if a report does not provide good leads and the investigation does not lead to a pros-
ecution, the complainant may still be a victim. An unlikely story does not necessarily mean 
that the individual concerned is not a trafficking victim. The human trafficker might have 
instructed the victim to apply for B9 status and provided her with a story for that purpose. 
The victim might also be reluctant to provide specific facts out of fear of the trafficker.

Continued residence (B16/7 Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines)
The changes that have been made since August 2006 to the rules for continued residence after 
expiration of B9 status are largely connected with observed shortcomings in the rules and a 
desire to relax the policy. The revised policy simplifies the rules both for the IND and for vic-
tims and it seems legitimate to expect that the changes will shorten the period of uncertainty 

NMR Ch05.indd   204 09-06-10   00:06



B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

205

for victims. Nevertheless, there do seem to be some problems with the implementation of the 
policy in practice. One problem concerns the flow of information between the authorities in-
volved in the criminal investigation of human trafficking (the police and public prosecution 
service), the IND, and the alien or her lawyer. IND officials sometimes have to go to a great 
deal of trouble to discover the status or the outcome of the investigation or the trial in a hu-
man trafficking case. That information can be crucial for victims given the potentially serious 
implications for their residence status. Both the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines and the 
Instruction on Human Trafficking adopted by the Council of Procurators-General require the 
public prosecutor to notify both the IND and the victim as soon as a decision is made not to 
proceed with the prosecution or final judgement is rendered. This rule is not always followed. 
There is often miscommunication, particularly a prosecution for human trafficking is discon-
tinued. The cases looked at in this report indicate that there is confusion about the notification 
to the individual concerned and the conditions for filing an objection.
This is an area where the care coordinator could perform a useful role.

An alien who wishes to invoke ground (1) of the B16/7 regulation (a conviction for human 
trafficking or for another offence in an indictment that includes human trafficking, where, 
as a result, there is a presumption in law that there are risks involved in repatriation to the 
country of origin) must personally submit a copy of the court decision to show that he or she 
is eligible for continued residence. However, the victim is not a party to the proceedings and 
therefore does not have a copy of the court decision and might not even be aware of it.

Since the B16/7 provision was amended, the prime responsibility for deciding whether a per-
son is a victim has shifted from the courts to the public prosecutor, since even an acquittal on 
a charge of human trafficking can constitute grounds for the victim’s continued residence, pro-
vided that the suspect is convicted of any of the other charges. In practice, victims remain uncer-
tain about the decision on their application for continued residence for an extended period of 
time, even though it is already clear at the time of prosecution that they are regarded as victims 
by the public prosecution service. Victims would be spared much time and uncertainty if the 
regulation were amended to allow an application for continued residence to be made as soon as 
the public prosecution service decides to summons a suspect. This practical amendment might 
also encourage victims to report an offence with sufficient leads to launch a successful prosecu-
tion. It would, then, be necessary to build in sufficient safeguards to ensure that victims remain 
available and willing to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution.

In 2005, to help improve the method of assessing whether a victim should be granted contin-
ued residence for reasons of safety, the partners in the chain agreed to start preparing safety 
files. However, in practice no safety files have yet been compiled; nor is there any evidence 
that the IND always performs a risk analysis of its own before deciding whether a victim can 
be required to return to his or her home country.

The IND’s decisions to allow continued residence for urgent reasons of a humanitarian nature 
generally provide no insight into the considerations on which those decisions are based.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

6.1 Introduction

Victims of human trafficking sometimes commit criminal offences that are connected with 
the human trafficking situation. Examples can include victims who are forced to use a false 
passport, victims who are exploited in cannabis plantations or victims who issue a false state-
ment under oath out of fear of the person exploiting them. There have also been cases where 
victims have been involved in drug smuggling, theft, fraud and assault under the influence of 
their trafficker.
At the time of writing, the Netherlands had almost reached the point of acceding to the 
Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.1 The con-
vention is the first international treaty to include a non-punishment provision for victims of 
human trafficking. This provision obliges states to provide for the possibility of not sanc-
tioning victims of human trafficking for their involvement in unlawful activities where they 
have been compelled to do so.
The Netherlands’ accession to the convention, and reports BNRM had received about vic-
tims as perpetrators, caused it to investigate the legal possibilities in this country for not 
prosecuting or punishing victims who are also offenders, how the possibilities that exit are 
exercised in practice and what the situation should be. The BNRM studied international law, 
legislation in the Netherlands and other countries and the literature and examined a number 
of specific cases. The results of the research are presented in this chapter. The review starts 
with the international legal framework (§6.2.1), followed by the framework created by Dutch 
legislation (§6.2.2). A number of cases were selected and analysed in more detail to assess 
how the law is applied in practice (§6.3). Finally, there is a comparative survey of the legisla-
tion and practice in dealing with victims as perpetrators in other countries (§6.4). The issues 
and problems that need to be addressed are discussed in the concluding section (§6.5).

6.2 Legal framework

This section describes the legal possibilities for not prosecuting or punishing victims who 
also commit offences. It starts with an outline of the international framework, before dis-
cussing the Dutch framework.

1 At the time of writing, the bill was before the Upper House of Parliament.

6.2.1 International legal framework

Various international instruments contain a non-punishment or equivalent provision for vic-
tims of human trafficking. We will first discuss the non-punishment provision in the Council 
of Europe’s Convention before briefly reviewing each of the other instruments. The section 
ends with some conclusions about the scope of the non-punishment principle in an interna-
tional context.

Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings
The Council of Europe’s Convention, which entered into force on 1 February 2008,2 is the 
first treaty to contain a non-punishment provision. Article 26 reads: ‘Each Party shall, in ac-
cordance with the basic principles of its legal system, provide for the possibility of not imposing 
penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities, to the extent that they may have 
been compelled to do so.’ The non-punishment clause contains the following elements:

 – The provision refers only to not imposing penalties, which means that the decision rests 
with the courts. It does not exclude the possibility of the victim being prosecuted by the 
public prosecution service.3

 – The individual must be a victim. However, it is impossible to determine from the defini-
tion of victim4 in the convention the precise time at which a person should be regarded as a 
victim. For example, is a person a victim from the time that human trafficking is suspected 
or only when there has been a conviction for human trafficking? Neither the convention 
nor the explanatory report to it provides certainty on this point.

 – A third element of Article 26 is involvement in unlawful activities. The choice of the phrase 
unlawful activities implies that their scope is wider than offences generally punishable un-
der criminal law and that other offences can also fall under the scope of the non-punish-
ment provision.5 Involvement also implies that complicity, for example, can fall under this 
provision.

 – The requirement of compulsion is reflected in the clause ‘to the extent that they have been 
compelled to do so’. It follows from the text of the explanatory report that there is in any case 
compulsion to commit an unlawful act if any of the means of committing the offence of hu-
man trafficking set out in article 4 of the convention is used.6 The wording of Article 26 also 
implies that there must be a causal connection between the unlawful activity and coercion 
to commit it. The coercion does not have to be exerted by the human trafficker personally.

2 Requirement for entry in force: ten ratifications, including eight by member states.
3 The recommendation by, inter alia, the Parliamentary Assembly, to expand the provision to include not pros-

ecuting victims was not adopted. See Recommendation 1695 (2005), 18 March 2005.
4 These are victims as defined in Article 4 of the Convention: ‘Victim’ shall mean any natural person who is sub-

ject to trafficking in human beings as defined in this article”.
5 For example, administrative offences.
6 Explanatory Report to the Convention, par. 273: “In particular, the requirement that victims have been com-

pelled […] shall be understood as comprising, at a minimum, victims that have been subject to any of the illicit 
means referred to in Article 4, when such involvement results from compulsion.”

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

209

Because the provision is laid down in the Council of Europe’s Convention, it has direct ef-
fect and is mandatory for the states that are party to the Convention. No reservations can be 
made to this provision. The wording of Article 26 is so general, however, that the provision 
merely requires member states to provide the possibility that victims of human trafficking 
will not be punished if the requirements of Article 26 are met. The provision therefore does 
not go so far as to totally exempt victims from punishment. However, the non-punishment 
provision does highlight the situation of victims who are perpetrators and requires member 
states and judges to reflect on the phenomenon and take appropriate measures. The scope of 
the provision means it can be applied on a case-by-case basis.

Formulation of the non-punishment provision in Article 26
It is interesting that when the Council of Europe’s Convention was being drafted, various 
amendments that go much further than the final text were submitted for Article 26. One of 
these read as follows: ‘Victims of trafficking shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted on the 
grounds that they have unlawfully entered or are illegally resident in countries of transit and destina-
tion, or for their involvement in unlawful activities of any kind to the extent that such involvement 
is a direct consequence of their situation as victims of trafficking.’7 This amendment goes much 
further than the final version of Article 26, since it constitutes a direct obligation on member 
states. The amendment also refers to a ban on detaining, charging or prosecuting victims, and 
no coercion is required.

General Assembly Resolution 55/67, Traffic in women and girls8

Passed in 2001, this UN resolution was the first international instrument to contain a non-
punishment provision for victims of human trafficking.9 The resolution is not legally bind-
ing, but the fact that it was adopted by the UN General Assembly gives it political value. 
The provision goes further than the non-punishment provision in the Council of Europe’s 
Convention in the sense that it refers to not prosecuting victims while the latter provision 
only refers to not punishing them. However, the scope of the provision in the UN resolution 
is also narrower since it is only concerned with the illegal entry or residence of victims; the

Men. This amendment was supported by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights and was unani-
mously adopted in Opinion No. 253 of the Parliamentary Assembly (Opinion No. 253 (2005), 26 January 
2005).

8 A/RES/55/67, 31 January 2001.
9 Paragraph 13: “Also invites Governments to consider preventing, within the legal framework and in accordance 

with national policies, victims of trafficking, in particular women and girls, from being prosecuted for their il-
legal entry or residence, taking into account that they are victims of exploitation;” Resolution A/RES/63/156 
of 30 January 2009 also includes a non-punishment provision: “Urges Governments to take all appropriate 
measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not penalised for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from 
re-victimisation as a result of actions taken by government authorities, and encourages Governments to prevent, 
within their legal framework and in accordance with national policies, victims of trafficking in persons from being 
prosecuted for their illegal entry or residence.”

non-punishment provision of the Council of Europe’s Convention is not restricted to a par-
ticular type of crime or illegal activity. 

UN Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking10

This UN instrument contains a non-punishment principle in three places: once in the Prin-
ciples11 and twice in the Guidelines12. The UN Recommended Principles and Guidelines contain 
a broad definition of non-punishment, with the same scope as the amendments submitted 
for Article 26 of the Convention of the Council of Europe.13 The premise of the UN Recom-
mended Principles and Guidelines is therefore that the non-punishment principle will have 
a wide scope.
Although the UN Recommended Principles and Guidelines are not legally binding and 
therefore do not create mandatory obligations for member states, they do have significant 
political value and consequently have some force. The fact that the UN Principles are often 
referred to also indicates that they are widely accepted and have growing influence.14

Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings15

The Brussels Declaration of 2002 contains a non-punishment clause in Article 13,16 which 
goes further than not punishing victims because it also refers to not further stigmatising, 
criminalising or prosecuting victims and not detaining them in detention centres. The provi-
sion even goes a step further than the terms of the UN Recommended Principles and Guide-
lines, since the requirement of a causal link between the offence and human trafficking is 
less strong because of the formulation ‘[…] that may have been committed […] as part of the 
trafficking process’.

10 UN Economic and Social Council, E/2002/68/Add.1, 20 May 2002.
11 Principle 7: “Trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted for the illegality of their own entry 

into or residence in countries of transit and destination, or for their involvement in unlawful activities to the extent 
that such involvement is a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons.”

12 Guideline 2 (Identification of trafficked persons and traffickers), paragraphs 5 and 6: “States should consider 
[…] 5. Ensuring that trafficked persons are not prosecuted for violations of immigration laws or for the activities 
they are involved in as a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. 6. Ensuring that trafficked per-
sons are not, in any circumstances, held in immigration detention nor other forms of custody.”

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

211

Like the UN Recommended Principles and Guidelines, the Brussels Declaration is not a le-
gally binding instrument. However, the fact that the Declaration was agreed upon by more 
than 1,000 states and organisations is an indication that it is an important political instru-
ment.

OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings17

The OSCE Action Plan from 2003 also contains a non-punishment provision18 but it is far 
narrower ion scope than those in the other instruments. The text literally states that legisla-
tion should ensure that victims do not face prosecution solely because they have been traf-
ficked.
The OSCE Action Plan is not a binding legal instrument but it does have political impor-
tance.

Draft Conclusions of the EU Council19

These Draft Conclusions include a non-punishment provision.20 At the time of writing, 
the European Commission had informally accepted the Draft Conclusions.21 Although the 
Council’s Draft Conclusions cannot be regarded as a legal instrument, the Council’s inter-
pretation of the non-prosecution of victims will have political relevance in terms of the back-
ground to the non-punishment principle when the Draft Conclusions are formally adopted. 
In its earlier conclusions22 the Council said that an important consequence of the possible 
punishment of victims of human trafficking is that it prevents victims from identifying 
themselves as such. The Council also argued that punishing victims is irreconcilable with 
the legal obligations of member states to protect and assist victims.23 As examples of offenc-
es committed by victims, the Council mentions obvious criminal offences such as breaches 
of migration rules, the use of false documents and working without a work permit. Interest-
ingly, the non-punishment provision in the Draft Conclusions refers only to not punishing 
victims, although the Council also says in its conclusions that in countries where the legality 
principle applies the non-punishment provision should guarantee that prosecutions are not 
brought or that they are interrupted by the court at an early stage. The term prosecution is 
also used earlier in the Draft Conclusions rather than punishment.

tions of immigration law or working without a work permit, or the use of false documents. Exceptions from non-
punishment should be possible in cases of extreme severity of the offence.”

Draft Framework Decision on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings24

By contrast with the existing framework decision, the proposal for the new EU Framework 
Decision on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings,25 which is due to be 
adopted by the Council of Ministers before the end of 2009, does contain a non-punishment 
provision.26 It is not entirely clear why the formulation ‘[…] unlawful activities as a direct 
consequence of being subjected to any of the illicit means […]’ was chosen in the proposal. 
According to this formulation, the criminal offences must be a direct consequence of the 
(coercive) illicit means rather than a direct consequence of the human trafficking situation 
the victims find themselves in.
The explanatory note to the proposed article 6 mentions the following examples of criminal 
offences by victims: breaches of migration law, then use of false documents or violations of 
the law governing prostitution. However, it should be clear that victims commit not only 
these obvious offences, but also other offences related to human trafficking. A wider for-
mulation of the non-punishment provision, similar to those in a number of the instruments 
referred to earlier, would in any case seem more appropriate.27 Article 6 is concerned with 
the non-punishment and non-prosecution of victims and in that regard it has a wider scope 
than Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s Convention. When it is adopted, the Framework 
Decision will be a legally binding instrument for EU member states.

Comparison of the non-punishment provisions in different international instruments

ments. The following table summarises the content of these instruments, with a clear com-
parison of their different elements and the status of each instrument.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

214

A comparison of the non-punishment provision in Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s 
Convention with the six other legal instruments highlights a number of aspects:

 – The Council of Europe’s Convention only refers to non-punishment; the other instru-
ments also refer at least to non-prosecution.

 – The Council of Europe’s Convention and the draft EU Framework Decision require 
means to compel the victim to commit the criminal offence or illegal activity. The other 
instruments do not require compulsion, but do require a direct link between the criminal 
offence and the human trafficking situation.

 – The obligation of non-punishment is indirect in the Council of Europe’s Convention and 
the draft Framework Decision because member states must only provide the possibility of 
non-punishment, while the other instruments – with the exception of the UN General As-
sembly Resolution – contain a direct (political) obligation by requiring that a victim will 
not be prosecuted/punished (or detained, indicted, secondarily victimised, stigmatised or 
criminalised).

 – The only two legally binding instruments, the Council of Europe Convention and the 
draft Framework Decision, go less far in some respects than the other, political, instru-
ments.

Although the Council of Europe’s Convention is legally binding and the other instruments 
(with the exception of the draft EU Framework Decision) are not, the other instruments can 
be helpful in interpreting and applying the non-punishment principle in the Netherlands. 
Because the other instruments are based on political consensus, they have political impor-
tance. Furthermore, the Netherlands is free to employ a wider definition of non-punishment 
than is required by the Council of Europe Convention.

Non-punishment from a human-rights perspective
States are obliged to respect and protect human rights. This gives rise to the following ob-
ligations in relation to human rights: human trafficking cases must be investigated and the 
perpetrators prosecuted; victims must be actively identified as such; victims must be assisted 
and protected; and victims must not be detained or prosecuted for status-related offences.28

In regard to the first obligation, punishing victims of human trafficking for unlawful acts 
that they have committed in a human trafficking situation could conflict with the obligation 
on states to investigate human trafficking cases and prosecute offenders. For the criminal 
investigation and prosecution of human traffickers, the police and prosecution service rely to 
a large extent on statements made by victims. However, the willingness of the victim to make 
a complaint and cooperate with the investigation is closely related to the risk that victims 
face of being prosecuted themselves for unlawful activities they committed in the situation 
of exploitation.29 This creates the risk that the victim will not make a complaint and that con-

28 See Gallagher (2005, pp. 213, 271-335). By ‘status-related offences’ Gallagher means offences and crimes that 
are directly related to a person’s status as a victim of human trafficking.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

sequently the case will never come to light and no investigation will be ordered. As a result, 
the human trafficker goes unpunished and the situation of exploitation continues.
Prosecuting victims of human trafficking can also conflict with the obligation to protect vic-
tims. The obligation to identify victims as such is also relevant in this respect, since a person 
who is not known to be a victim cannot be protected. Identifying a victim is also very impor-
tant in the context of the obligation not to detain and prosecute victims. In practice, victims 
are often prosecuted because they have not been identified as such.30 But even when a person 
is identified as a victim, the relationship between the criminal offence committed by the vic-
tim and the situation of exploitation will not always be entirely clear. The question is how far 
the state must go in meeting its human-rights obligation to protect victims. To what extent 
does the interest of protecting the victim prevail and in which cases should the interest of 
prosecuting the victim take priority?

6.2.2 National legal framework

This section discusses Dutch legislation pertaining to the possibilities for not punishing or 
prosecuting victims as offenders. The section starts with a review of the interpretation in the 
Netherlands of the international non-punishment provision and then goes on to discuss the 
more general possibilities of not prosecuting or punishing suspects.

The interpretation of non-punishment in the Netherlands
The explanatory report to the Council of Europe’s Convention states that the requirements 
of the Convention’s non-punishment principle are met by the remedy of the judicial pardon 
as laid down in Article 9a of the Dutch Criminal Code,31 which reads: ‘The judge may deter-
mine in the judgment that no punishment or measure shall be imposed, where he deems this 
advisable, by reason of the lack of gravity of the offence, the character of the offender or the 
circumstances attendant upon the commission of the offence thereafter.’ Strictly speaking, 
the Netherlands complies with Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s Convention with the 
judicial pardon. Article 9a of the Dutch Criminal Code does not contains any restrictions 
with respect to forms of offence. This, combined with the wording of Article 26 of the Coun-
cil of Europe’s Convention, makes it clear that it was also the intention of the Dutch legis-
lature not to make any restriction in terms of the type of offence. In combination with the 
principle in the Netherlands that the public prosecutor has discretion to decide whether or 
not to prosecute (the principle of expediency) and the possibility for a case to be dismissed, 
in theory there are sufficient possibilities to observe the non-punishment principle. In view 
of the points made above and the application of the principle of expediency, there is also no 
restriction, in terms of the type of offence, on the possibility to dismiss charges.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

216

The Dutch reaction to a UN resolution entitled Improving the coordination of efforts against 
trafficking in persons32 sets forth a firm position with regard to victims as offenders: ‘One 
should also bear in mind that victims are often forced by traffickers to engage in activities that 
constitute infractions of the law. Clearly, victims should not be punished for this.’33 The Neth-
erlands then refers to the non-punishment clause of Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s 
Convention and says: ‘It [the non-punishment clause; BNRM] is a principle that should be 
highlighted.’34

Decisions not to prosecute
The principle of expediency means that charges brought against a victim who is also an of-
fender can be dropped.35 A decision not to prosecute goes further than the non-punishment 
provision of Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s Convention, since that provision refers to 
the non-punishment of a victim. If a case is dismissed, there is no prosecution at all. Prosecu-
tion can be a nasty experience for a victim, uncertainty about the outcome being one of the 
contributing factors. It might be desirable to spare the victim the possibly traumatic experi-
ence of criminal proceedings. 
One of the grounds laid down for dismissing a case must apply before a decision can be made 
not to prosecute36 and the decision must also not conflict with the principles of due process. 
In principle, the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute any offence, with the excep-
tion of certain offences for which the Netherlands is obliged to prosecute by treaty. If the 
offence committed by the victim is of a more serious nature, the public interest in bringing a 
prosecution will weigh heavily and the charges are less likely to be dropped.
The situation of victims of human trafficking who are also offenders is not a specific ground 
for abandoning a prosecution. Because the public prosecutor who leads the investigation 
into a criminal offence committed by a victim is usually not the public prosecutor who inves-
tigates the human traffickers, he or she may not be sufficiently aware of the circumstances 
under which a victim committed an offence.

Grounds for exemption from criminal liability
When it is decided that the victim will be prosecuted, there are grounds that, where they 
apply, can lead to dismissal of the charges. Grounds for exemption from criminal liability 
that could apply to victims of human trafficking under certain circumstances are a (psycho-

logical) force that he or she could not be expected to resist (overmacht)37 and necessary self-
defence or self-defence or defence of another person against an unlawful attack or action 
exceeding the limits of necessary defence where the excess is the direct result of a strong 
emotion provoked by the attack.38

Causing and soliciting the commission of a criminal offence and exploitation in crime
There are various offences for which a human trafficker who causes the victim to commit a 
criminal offence can be prosecuted. In some cases, this will lead to immunity from punish-
ment for the victim.
When a person intentionally causes another, innocent, person to commit a criminal offence 
it may constitute the offence of causing the commission of an offence.39 Although there used 
to be a requirement that the actual perpetrator was an unwilling instrument, the only re-
quirement now is that for one reason or another he or she is not criminally liable.40 There 
are a number of reasons why the executor might not be criminally liable, such as the absence 
of intent, guilt or imputability, for example, or a psychological inability to resist.41 When in 
a situation of human trafficking it is assumed that the commission of an offence by a victim 
of human trafficking was caused by the human trafficker, the human trafficker is punishable 
for it, while the victim (the perpetrator) is not liable for punishment. There is one known 
case in Dutch jurisprudence where a human trafficker was convicted of causing a victim to 
smuggle drugs.42 This case is discussed in the following section as the Case of coerced drug 
smuggling. 
Another offence that can be committed by a human trafficker who compels victims to com-
mit a crime is solicitation of the commission of an offence.43 The difference between solicit-
ing and causing the commission of an criminal offence is that in the former case the actual 
perpetrator of the offence is punishable and in the latter he or she is not.
Rather than constituting soliciting or causing the commission of an offence, the conduct 
that compels a victim to commit a criminal offence can also be categorised as human traf-
ficking if all of the elements of the definition of the offence are met.44 The first conviction for 
human trafficking in the sense of criminal exploitation was rendered in April 2009.45 In that 

37 Article 40 Dutch Criminal Code. Particularly a psychological inability to resist and self-defence could apply 
for victims of human trafficking. For a detailed explanation of the Dutch concept of overmacht, see De Hullu, 
2006.

violence, threat or deception or providing the opportunity, means or information, intentionally solicit the

44 By contrast with the Netherlands, in Belgium, for instance, exploitation in crime is explicitly mentioned as a 
form of human trafficking in the criminal law (Article 433quinquies, (1) (5) Criminal Code). See also §6.4.1.

case, the court also found that the offence of causing the commission of drug smuggling had 
been proved.

6.3 Cases in the Netherlands

As explained in the preceding section, there is no specific non-punishment provision for 
victims of human trafficking in Dutch legislation. There are, however, general possibilities 
for declining to prosecute or punish victims, but the question is whether these options are 
availed of in practice and when a person’s status as victim is actually taken into account. To 
investigate this, BNRM studied a number of cases involving victims who committed crimi-
nal offences.
The various cases covered in this qualitative study came from the police, the public prosecu-
tion service, NGOs, lawyers and case law. By studying different cases, we can discover how 
victims who are suspects are treated in practice and what problems arise. Because of the va-
riety of cases studied, they are divided into the following categories: I. Exploitation in crime; 
II. Perjury/making a false statement (article 207 Dutch Criminal Code); III. Assisting in hu-
man trafficking; IV. Criminal behaviour related to migration law; V. Offences committed 
against the will of the human trafficker; and IV. Other. A review of the consequences under 
immigration law for victims who are suspects is given in §6.3.1.

I. Exploitation in crime
As mentioned in the preceding section, exploitation in crime is a form of human trafficking. 
A number of the cases that were studied showed evidence of (possible) cases of exploitation 
in crime, revealing some of the features of this form of exploitation.
The first characteristic is that criminal offences committed by the victim can be regarded 
as ‘work or services’. In some cases the ‘work or services’ consisted solely of the commis-
sion of offences; in others there were also other forms of exploitation. In all of the cases 
investigated, the overriding motive of the human trafficker was financial gain. The human 
trafficker can be seen as the ‘brain’ behind the offences and the victim as the perpetrator. In 
some cases, the influence of the human trafficker was so great that he could also be regarded 
as ‘causing the commission of the offence’. In every case studied, the victim surrendered the 
proceeds of the crime to the human trafficker. In some cases, the victim received a small fee. 
Three types of criminal offence were identified in the cases of exploitation in crime that were 
studied: drug-related offences, theft and fraud.

Exploitation in crime: drug-related offences

Case of cannabis nursery – Fleurtop
During a raid on a cannabis plantation, 28 people, mainly Bulgarian women, engaged in cut-
ting the cannabis plants were arrested. During the criminal investigation, the suspicion arose 
that the cutters were being exploited. The Bulgarians were illegal immigrants and were in a vul-

219

nerable position. The work was poorly paid and the working conditions were bad. A number 
of the cutters were interviewed about exploitation in the employment relationship. Three of 
them made a complaint of human trafficking and were granted B9 status. The suspects then 
prosecuted but the court found that human trafficking had not been proved.46

In a separate case before the police magistrate the three cutters who had received a residence 
permit on the grounds of the B9 regulation were prosecuted for offences against the Opium 
Act. They received prison sentences of several weeks. When the public prosecutor became 
aware that the cutters were being exploited when the offences were committed and that the 
‘employers’ had been prosecuted for human trafficking, the sentences of the cutters were extin-
guished by prescription.47 However, one of the three victims had already served her sentence.

Although there was no conviction for human trafficking in this case, the granting of B9 sta-
tus to the three cannabis cutters shows that they were initially regarded as victims. There 
was a direct connection between the human trafficking and the criminal offence since the 
‘work or services’ consisted of cutting cannabis, which is an offence against the Opium Act. 
Because the two cases were heard separately, the fact that one of the cutters was a victim 
only emerged after she had already served her sentence. Cooperation between the two pub-
lic prosecutors in this case could perhaps have prevented that.
Another point is whether the three cutters should have been prosecuted in this case. They 
were regarded as victims of human trafficking, they cooperated with the criminal investiga-
tion against the suspects of human trafficking and they were granted B9 status. The inves-
tigation centred on human trafficking in the form of exploitation in a cannabis plantation. 
It is difficult to understand why the public prosecution service regarded them as victims of 
exploitation in a cannabis plantation, while at the same time regarding them as suspects be-
cause of the same work they had to perform in the cannabis plantation. Cooperation within 
the public prosecution service could also have led to a different decision in that respect.

Under certain circumstances, drug smuggling carried out under coercion can also be de-
scribed as ‘work or services’ within the meaning of exploitation in crime.

Case of coerced drug smuggling
On 22 April 2009, the District Court in Haarlem48 rendered judgement in a case involving 
exploitation in crime. In this case a woman was invited to visit Curacao under false pretences 
by her former boyfriend. The former boyfriend asked the woman to bring one of her children 
(a three-month-old baby). When she arrived in Curacao it emerged that the suspect had other 
plans for her. The suspect ordered the woman to smuggle his drugs to the Netherlands. He 
made serious threats against the woman and her baby. She was also beaten by the suspect and 
raped in the presence of her baby.
Without the suspect’s knowledge, the woman telephoned the Dutch diplomatic mission in Cu-
racao. She also called her father in the Netherlands and told him she was coming to the Nether-

46 This case is also discussed in §12.6.2.
47 This means that the sentence is not enforced.

lands with drugs. She asked him to call the police and remove her two other children from the 
suspect’s mother, with whom they were staying. Her father immediately went into action.
On the day of the woman’s return flight the suspect forcibly pushed packages of cocaine into 
her vagina and anus, making various threats. He then brought her and her baby to the airport. 
On arrival at Schiphol, the woman was taken aside by customs officers. The packages of co-
caine were found in her body and the woman made a statement. She was arrested and placed 
in custody.
The district court convicted the former boyfriend of human trafficking, describing the coerced 
drug smuggling as ‘work or services’. The defendant was also convicted of rape and causing the 
commission of the offence of drug smuggling. He was given a prison sentence of four years. The 
district court found: ‘By causing said import, the defendant abused the complainant [victim], a 
former girlfriend, whom the defendant treated as nothing other than a machine, an object.’.49

The victim was not prosecuted. She was released from custody after three days and more than 
five months later the case against her was dismissed. It was not legally possible to prosecute 
her for drug smuggling because it had been proved that the former boyfriend had caused the 
commission of the drug smuggling.50 If the court had declared causing the commission of the 
offence not proven, according to the public prosecutor concerned, the woman could have in-
voked a psychological inability to resist, which could have led to dismissal of the charges.

The above case led to the first conviction for human trafficking in the sense of exploitation 
in crime in the Netherlands. It was evident in this case that the victim was forced to smuggle 
the drugs, saw no alternative than to suffer the actions of the defendant and even tried to 
seek help and to call the authorities. In other cases that were studied, the degree of (physical) 
compulsion was less obvious, so it was more difficult to produce evidence of exploitation in 
crime and causing the commission of an offence.

Drug smuggling case II
The 18-year-old victim (X) fell into the hands of a loverboy (K) in the Netherlands, who forced 
her into prostitution. After some time, K, together with other suspects, started using victim 
X as a drugs courier. According to her statement, X was forced to bring a suitcase from the 
Dominican Republic to the Netherlands. At the airport in the Dominican Republic X was ar-
rested with more than 20 kg of cocaine in the suitcase she was carrying. In first instance, X was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison for attempted drug smuggling. On appeal, the sentence was 
reduced to five years in the Dominican prison.
In the Netherlands, K was convicted of human trafficking and of complicity in an attempt to 
smuggle cocaine. He received a prison sentence of four years. The district court found: ‘The 
second proven offence [drug smuggling; BNRM] is an extension of that [human trafficking; 
BNRM]. Through her loverboy, [victim] became involved in drug smuggling. […] The defend-
ant played an essential part in that offence by ensuring that [victim] was used as a drugs courier 
and departed for the Dominican Republic to collect drugs.’51 The judgment has been appealed 
and the outcome of the appeal was not known at the time of writing.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

221

This case differs from the previous case in a number of respects. For example, the victim in 
Drug smuggling case II was first exploited in prostitution, and only later used to smuggle 
drugs. In the Case of coerced drug smuggling, there was clearly coercion to smuggle drugs 
because of the finding that the physical violence, the rape and the threats had been proved. 
The means of coercion in Drug smuggling case II seem to be more subtle and are perhaps 
more difficult to prove. Furthermore, in that case, the legal system of another country had 
jurisdiction in the drug case against the victim. However, the smuggling of the drugs by the 
victim could be regarded as exploitation in crime, but that charge was not brought in this 
case.
Little is known about the number of victims that are prosecuted abroad for drug-related of-
fences.52 The impression is, however, that growing numbers of victims of loverboys are used 
to commit drug-related offences to generate additional income for the loverboy. In response 
to enquiries, the Asja shelter said it had the impression that roughly half of the victims stay-
ing there had been involved in drug-related crime.53 A number of them had also been pros-
ecuted for it. Some of the victims who were prosecuted subsequently made a complaint of 
human trafficking and entered the shelter after their detention. On the other hand, BNRM 
also knows of cases where victims were used exclusively to smuggle drugs, without sexual 
exploitation. A typical feature of all the cases involving drug smuggling by victims that were 
studied is that they involved young women who were persuaded to smuggle drugs through 
the use of loverboy methods. The victims had a personal relationship with the human traf-
ficker, in contrast to the commercial relationship between the victims and human trafficker 
in the case of the cannabis cutters. In some cases of drug smuggling by victims, physical and/
or sexual violence was used or threatened.

Exploitation in crime: theft
In its research, BNRM also encountered several cases of theft by victims of human traffick-
ing. In the cases studied, the coerced thefts could be described as exploitation in crime.
As described in Chapter 4 of this report, there are examples of minors with no residence per-
mit being used to commit thefts (pickpocketing and/or burglaries). Many of them are Roma 
children who do not go to school and earn money by playing music, selling newspapers, beg-
ging and/or stealing. These activities can be regarded as ‘work or services’, and can consti-
tute human trafficking if the other elements of the offence exist54. According to a guideline 

52 In response to questions from member of parliament Van Velzen (SP) (Parliamentary Documents II 2007/08, 
4115) about the number of girls detained abroad who claim to have been forced to smuggle drugs by a lover-
boy, the Ministers of Justice and Foreign Affairs replied that on average 11% of all Dutch persons detained 
abroad say they did so under compulsion. However, it is not known whether they were compelled by a lover-
boy or in some other way (reply of 17 April 2008). It is therefore impossible to say how many are victims of 
human trafficking (see also Parliamentary Documents II 2008/09, 30 010, no. 11). See also §9.4.

53 Interview, Asja shelter, 23 April 2009.
54 It is important in this context that no means of coercion are required in the case of underage victims. See, for 

example, Article 273f (1) (2) Dutch Criminal Code.

issued by the Child Protection Council,55 it will inform the judge if it suspects that the minor 
committed a criminal offence, and in Amsterdam it consults with the public prosecution 
service on how a case should be handled. As far as is known, there is no specific policy not to 
prosecute children when they are regarded as victims of human trafficking. However, minors 
are frequently not prosecuted because they have not reached the age of 12 and cannot be held 
criminally responsible.

Pickpocketing
In Amsterdam, several Romanian boys under the age of 12 were caught pickpocketing. A series 
of different people came to the police station claiming to be the boys’ parents, but they were 
not. The boys were placed under the supervision of the Child Protection Council and repatri-
ated to Romania. They were not prosecuted because of their age.
Although the public prosecutor believed that it might be a case of human trafficking, no group 
of offenders was found.

The fact that the boys might have been victims of human trafficking was not decisive in 
declining to prosecute the boys in this case. The case was dismissed because of their age. 
BNRM is not aware of any cases where child pickpockets were not prosecuted because of 
a suspicion that they were victims of human trafficking. There are other measures that are 
taken to protect this category of children.56

Another form of coerced theft that can be regarded as human trafficking in the sense of 
criminal exploitation involves victims of sexual exploitation who are used to commit thefts, 
usually to generate additional income for the exploiter. The cases investigated by BNRM 
involved adult victims who had a personal association with the human trafficker. These cases 
are similar to those involving victims of exploitation who were involved in selling and smug-
gling drugs under the influence of a human trafficker/loverboy.

Case of theft and intimidation
B was exploited in prostitution by her pimp (J). B was known to the police as a victim of human 
trafficking although she had never made a complaint against J. One day B became involved in a 
criminal offence when she tied up one of her clients during a sex game and then admitted her 
pimp J and his accomplice C. J and C threatened the bound client with a gun and robbed him. 
When the client reported the offence, B, J and C were arrested and placed in custody. Although 
the police regarded B as a victim of human trafficking, they did not consider dismissing the 
case against her. One of the factors in this decision was that she acted as a suspect and not as a 
victim of human trafficking. She was also uncooperative towards the police and the client who 
had been robbed.

ed by the team.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

223

Although in this case there was a certain relationship between B’s exploitation and her role in 
the intimidation and robbery of the client (since the offence was committed in the situation 
of exploitation), it was not an option for the public prosecution service to dismiss the case 
against B by reason of the fact that she was a victim. The seriousness of the offence, B’s role 
in it, the harm caused to the client and B’s attitude were important factors in this decision.

Case of fraud
A was forced by D to work as a prostitute and had to give all her income to D. After some 
time, A became personally involved with one of her clients. The client, who was in love with A, 
wanted to give her a car as a present. When D discovered this, he pressured A into asking for 
an expensive car. The client agreed and bought the expensive car. A immediately had to give the 
car to D who, wanting to earn even more money from A, then repeatedly forced her to squeeze 
money out of D under false pretences. A had to give any money she secured in this way to D.
The public prosecution service started a criminal investigation against D, who was charged 
with human trafficking and fraud. A was not a suspect because it was clear to the public pros-
ecution service that her involvement in defrauding the client was directly connected with the 
compulsion exerted upon her by D. A was seen from the outset as a victim rather than a per-
petrator.

In this case, D could have been charged with exploitation in crime. It is also possible to argue 
that he could have been guilty of causing the commission of fraud, particularly since A was 
not regarded as an offender.
In both of the cases discussed above, victims of human trafficking committed a criminal of-
fence that seems to have been initiated by their exploiter. In both cases, the victim of the 
crime was a client. B, the victim of exploitation in the first case, was prosecuted, while A, 
the victim of exploitation in the second case, was regarded as innocent. The arguments for 
prosecuting B can also be raised against A since the offence in the second case was also seri-
ous, the victim played an active role in it and the client suffered serious detriment. However, 
because it was established in the second case that A was coerced into committing the fraud 
by her exploiter and immediately had to surrender the ‘gains’ to him, the prosecutor chose 
not to regard the victim as a suspect. This second case is also closer to an instance of causing 
the commission of an offence.

Exploitation in crime: fraud
A third form of coerced crime that can be regarded as human trafficking under certain cir-
cumstances is the commission of fraud under compulsion. In the fifth report of the NRM, 
various cases were described in which forcing a person to commit fraud was regarded as 
exploitation. Interestingly, the relationship between the victim and the exploiter in three of 
the four cases described in NRM5 was a personal relationship accompanied by physical vio-
lence. The fraud in the three cases consisted of forgery, making false statements, participa-
tion in the smuggling of a child, benefit fraud and use of false identities. None of the three 
victims were prosecuted for fraud. They were referred to the social services. In one case, the 

NMR Ch06.indd   223 09-06-10   00:06



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

224

person who forced the victim to commit fraud was himself prosecuted and convicted of as-
sault and fraud. None of the exploiters were prosecuted for human trafficking.

II. Perjury/making a false statement, Article 207 Dutch Criminal Code
Besides exploitation in crime, situations are also conceivable where the victim commits a 
crime that is related to human trafficking without being part of the human trafficking. One 
crime that often occurs in this context is perjury by a victim. These are cases where a victim 
makes a false statement (often under pressure from or out of feelings of loyalty towards the 
human trafficker) about the human trafficking. In contrast to exploitation in crime, in this 
instance the human trafficker’s intention is not financial gain, but avoiding prosecution.

Case of making a false statement
F made a complaint of human trafficking. She declared, among other things, that her pimp (M) 
had forced her to work in prostitution. Some time after M’s arrest, F withdrew her incriminat-
ing statement about him. She denied being a victim of human trafficking and declared that she 
had lied in her earlier statements to the police. Because the public prosecutor suspected that F 
was a victim of human trafficking (on the grounds of statements made by other witnesses), he 
decided to arrest F and place her in custody for making a false statement. The public prosecu-
tor hoped that F’s arrest would persuade her to tell the truth. When she was brought before the 
examining magistrate, F finally admitted that she had been forced to retract her incriminating 
statement by M’s brother.
Partly thanks to F’s statements, both M and his brother were tried and convicted. The public 
prosecutor agreed with F that she would not be prosecuted if she committed no more offences 
for a certain period. F honoured the agreement and the case against her was dropped.

In this case, the victim was arrested for making a false statement in an attempt to persuade 
her to tell the truth. Placing her in custody also protected her against possible threats.

The question is to what extent it is desirable to charge and punish victims for perjury if they 
stick to their false statement for fear of reprisals. The district court in Utrecht explicitly con-
sidered this problem in a judgment in a human trafficking case.57 The following passage is 
taken from the judgment.

Case of perjury
“The attitude of the sworn witness at the hearing on 11 July 2007 could have given cause to 
execute an ex officio report of perjury. The court expressly considered this option. The public 
prosecutor stated in an official report of findings drawn up by her on 26 April 2007 (page 175) 
that the witness would have to tell the truth at the hearing but that she would not have the wit-
ness arrested on suspicion of perjury if she did not. 
This statement appears undesirable to the court. It is, after all, essential for the criminal proc-
ess, in which the finding of truth is central, that a sworn witness tells the truth and is not a 
priori granted a certain degree of immunity by the public prosecutor. On the other hand, the

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

225

court understands that the public prosecutor wished to ensure that this witness would appear 
at the hearing so that the court could form its own opinion concerning her reliability. Finally, 
in this context the court has also taken cognisance of the report by Professor Bullens et al., 
inserted in the case file by the public prosecutor, with a detailed description of the position of 
victims of so-called loverboys, in which the threat of violence, great psychological pressure and 
playing on the feelings of guilt of mainly vulnerable young women are not shunned. The court 
feels that there is sufficient evidence that the witness was still in such a position at the hearing. 
For these reasons, the court has decided not to make an official report of perjury.”58

III. Assistance in human trafficking59

The stereotype of men in the role of offenders and women in the role of victims of sexual 
exploitation is often inaccurate. As described in §9.2.3, 18% of the suspects of human traf-
ficking in 2007 were women. A recent report by the UNODC shows that, in relation to their 
involvement in other offences, women are involved relatively frequently in human traffick-
ing.60 In 2006, having analysed 89 case files, Siegel and De Blank divided female suspects 
of human trafficking into three categories: executors, partners-in-crime and madams.61 Of-
fenders are described as executors when they are subordinate to the principal human traf-
fickers and perform specific tasks for the leader or other members of the organisation, either 
“voluntarily” or under the threat of violence.62 These tasks may include giving ‘work instruc-
tions’ to other victims and collecting money for the pimp. The category of executor includes 
women who perform executive tasks under compulsion as well as women who agree to do 
so out of loyalty, because they see a possibility of earning money or because of their feelings 
for a member of the criminal gang.63 Interviews with the police show that another factor for 
some victims is that by helping with human trafficking they also rise in the pecking order 
among the prostitutes, which often brings certain privileges (such as a day off or having 
to earn less money). In that respect, performing certain tasks for the human trafficker can 
be regarded as a survival strategy. Since the degree to which these tasks are performed vol-
untarily varies, the distinction between offender and victim is often vague. Women in the 
categories partners-in-crime and madams operate voluntarily and play a larger role in hu-
man trafficking.64 The actions of the women in these categories is not directly related to their 
being victims.

Case of involvement in human trafficking I
A was exploited in prostitution by H. When H wanted to force a new victim, B, into prostitu-
tion, A helped H under pressure. A declared: “H used me to convince B.” The judgment in the

case against H states: “Furthermore, in association with this woman – and by abusing her love 
– he forced an underage girl […] to work as a prostitute for him.”65 A issued instructions to B 
and B had to surrender her earnings to A, who then gave them to H. Despite A’s (minor) role 
in the trafficking of B, A was never formally treated as a suspect. One of the factors in this was 
that statements by B showed that A was herself a victim of human trafficking. A was exploited 
and regularly abused by H. A and B became friends, which shows that B did not regard A as an 
offender. 

H was prosecuted and convicted of human trafficking with respect to A and B.

In this case, A performed the role of executor. The public prosecution service regarded A as 
a victim, and therefore not as a suspect. The fact of being a victim was therefore a decisive 
factor.

Case of involvement in human trafficking II
In the previously mentioned Sneep case, one of the victims (O) was also suspected of (complic-
ity in) human trafficking, because she collected ‘protection money’ from other victims. The 
public prosecution service dropped the case against O on the grounds of psychological inabil-
ity to resist. The fact that O was initially regarded as a victim, her relatively small role in the 
human trafficking activities and the coercion were factors in this decision. Interestingly, the 
judgment convicting O’s trafficker explicitly states in its findings on human trafficking: “who 
persuaded [O; BNRM] to collect protection money from one or more prostitutes […].”66 Here, 
the court shows that collecting the money was part of the human trafficking. Consequently, O 
was primarily a victim of these actions, not an offender.

It is clear that in this case the actions of the two suspect victims were also seen as execu-
tive actions. The two victims consequently fell into the category described by Siegel and De 
Blank as executors67 and they were not prosecuted.

IV. Criminal offences related to migration law
Foreign and underage victims regularly use false, forged or ‘look-alike’ travel documents. 
This constitutes a criminal offence under Article 231 (2) Dutch Criminal Code.68 The docu-
ments may be needed to travel to the Netherlands, but also to create the pretence that the 
holders have legal status or are adults (to enable them to work in prostitution, for example). 
The possession of a false or forged passport is one of the indicators of human trafficking.69 
The victim often incurs a large debt to the trafficker for the false document, thereby creating 
a situation of dependency.

66 Almelo District Court, 11 July 2008, LJN: BD6957.
67 Siegel & De Blank (2008).
68 Article 231 (2) Dutch Criminal Code reads: “The punishment in section 1 is also applicable to a person who 

possesses a travel document he knows or should reasonably suspect to be false or falsified, or who intention-
ally makes use of a travel document not made out in his name.”

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

227

In practice, a victim identified in the Netherlands as having illegal travel documents is un-
likely to be prosecuted for a breach of Article 231 (2) Dutch Criminal Code. The problem, 
however, is that a victim is not always recognised as such and may be prosecuted and convict-
ed despite being a victim. For example, Zwart argues: “I have also come across several cases 
where aliens have been prosecuted for the intentional possession of a false travel document 
even though the official report of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee shows that they may 
be victims of human trafficking.”70

Case of possession of false passports
Three women were approached in China by a man who offered to smuggle them to the US 
where they could earn ‘a lot of money’. The man arranged the trip. During a stopover at 
Schiphol, where the women had travelled to on their own passports, they were met by another 
woman who told them that she would give them false passports for the rest of the journey. 
Shortly afterwards, the three women were arrested on suspicion of complicity in an attempt to 
secure a false passport. During further interviews with the three women it emerged that they 
had to pay a lot of money for the trip and did not know their destination. They had been told 
that they would have to work for around four years to repay the price of the trip but were not 
aware of the type of work they would have to perform in the US to repay the money. According 
to a statement by the interviewing officer, she suspected that the three women would be forced 
to work abroad for the organisation that organised the trip. The women did not dare to make a 
complaint of human trafficking for fear of the organisation, according to their lawyer. 
At the trial, the women’s lawyer invoked the non-punishment principle. The police magistrate 
decided, however that it had not been established that the women were victims of human traf-
ficking. The women received prison sentences of four weeks, two of which were suspended. 
The lawyer appealed.

There were several indications of human trafficking in this case, but because the women did 
not make a complaint or otherwise cooperate with the public prosecution service they were 
not regarded as victims of human trafficking. Since it was not established that they were 
victims, they could not invoke the non-punishment principle. This judgment pinpoints the 
problem when it comes to prosecuting potential victims of human trafficking. If a suspect is 
not recognised as a victim of human trafficking, the non-punishment principle will not be 
applied and the potential victim will be prosecuted and punished like anyone else.

Cases of a privileged document
L was an Asian working as a domestic worker for a foreign diplomat in the Netherlands. L was 
allowed to work in the Netherlands on the basis of a privileged document that was issued on 
the grounds of her employment contract with the diplomat. L was exploited by her employer 
and decided to run away. However, this was regarded as a breach of contract, on the grounds of 
which L was committing an offence because from that moment on she was no longer allowed 
to use the privileged document. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was aware of the matter and 
wondered whether it was required to make a complaint against L for her unlawful use of the 

70 Zwart (2008), p. 227.

NMR Ch06.indd   227 09-06-10   00:06



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

228

privileged document. In consultation with the police, it was decided not to make a complaint 
against L because she would then have been prosecuted even though she had no other way of 
escaping from her employer. L disappeared and started living illegally in the country.

This case illustrates that the situation where foreign domestic workers employed by a dip-
lomat and working in the Netherlands on the basis of a privileged document cannot escape 
from the human trafficker/employer without committing an offence themselves.71 After all, 
when the victim leaves the employer the privileged document that allows them to live and 
work legally in the Netherlands is no longer valid. In deciding whether to prosecute the vic-
tim it is therefore important to seriously consider the circumstances under which the offence 
was committed.
Another consideration is that fear of prosecution could make the victim reluctant to go to the 
police. It is therefore important for all victims of human trafficking to have the possibility of 
safely making a complaint to the police, without facing the risk of prosecution.

V. Offences committed against the will of the human trafficker
In all of the offences committed by victims discussed above, the exploiter benefited in some 
way from the offences that were committed. This section discusses offences of a different 
nature; a victim might commit a crime in order to escape from a situation of exploitation, 
for example. Victims might steal a car or money to escape from the exploiter or use a false 
document to move abroad and hide from the exploiter.72 In such cases, it is important that 
the circumstances in which the offences are committed are taken into account in deciding 
whether to prosecute. 
Another category of offence that can be committed against the will of the human trafficker 
are those where victims take the law into their own hands. BNRM has encountered two such 
cases in the Netherlands, one of which is described below.

Case of making threats and extortion
A was a victim of human trafficking who was exploited in prostitution by G. A had to surrender 
her income to G. When A was able to escape from G’s influence, she and a friend decided one 
day to demand that G return the money she had earned. G then reported A for extortion and 
making threats. A was arrested. When she was interviewed, A declared that she was exploited 
in prostitution by G and that she only wanted to demand the return of the money she had 
earned from G. A was known to the police as a victim of human trafficking. She made a com-
plaint against G, who was convicted of human trafficking with respect to a number of victims. 
In is not known whether A was prosecuted for extortion and making threats.

In this case, the victim was in no way forced to commit the offence. The offence took place 
after the situation of human trafficking had already ended. Although there was a certain 

71 See also §12.5.2 of this report for a discussion of the risk group ‘domestic workers of diplomats’.
72 For an example of this, see R v O case in the United Kingdom; §6.4.2.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

229

connection between the human trafficking and the offence, the connection was less direct 
than in the cases described earlier because A had in fact already escaped from the influence 
of her exploiter when the offence was committed. A could have taken a civil action to claim 
back any income she had lost, but instead chose to take the law into her own hands. The non-
punishment principle is not intended to cover such cases. However, it is conceivable that if A 
were prosecuted her personal circumstances could play a role in the sentencing.

VI. Other
Another case that does not fall under any of the above categories is one in which three vic-
tims of human trafficking were involved in the death of an infant.

Mehak case (abuse of an infant causing its death)73 
At the beginning of 2006, three adults (A, B and C) brought the 18-month-old infant W to 
the hospital with severe injuries. Shortly afterwards, W was pronounced dead. Although the 
adults alleged that W was injured as a result of falling down the stairs, an autopsy showed that 
the infant’s death was caused by abuse. The investigation into the cause of W’s death brought 
to light another offence. A and B had exploited W’s parents (C and D) and a cousin (E) in their 
household and assaulted them. It was a case of human trafficking. C, D and E came from India 
and were brought to the Netherlands by A and B. The victims depended entirely on A and B, 
received a very low wage and lived in A and B’s house. C, D and E worked long days and their 
contacts with the outside world were severely restricted. Physical violence was used. The dis-
trict court found that the victims’ physical and mental integrity and personal freedom had been 
seriously violated and convicted A and B – in their absence – of human trafficking.
The abuses suffered by W were based on the belief of A (the employer/mistress of the house) 
that W was possessed by an evil spirit. W (or the spirit) was blamed every time anything went 
wrong in the house. W had to be beaten and tied up to tame the spirit.
The offences committed by each of the suspects are briefly described below.

A – the employer/mistress of the house:
A assaulted W and ordered W’s parents to use violence against the infant. According to the 
judgment74 in A’s case: “The defendant caused the parents of [W] to neglect and beat their 
daughter.” The grounds for the sentence also state: “To their detriment, the court finds that the 
situation of exploitation that existed must also be deemed to have created a breeding ground 
for the final acts of violence against [W].” A was found guilty of: (charge 1, alternative) acces-
sory to premeditated assault, causing death; (charge 2, primary) human trafficking commit-
ted by two or more persons acting in concert, multiple offences; (charge 3) accessory to the 
intentional influencing of the freedom of a person to make a truthful or honest statement to a 
judge or public official, multiple offences; (second alternative) accessory to premeditated as-
sault, multiple offences. With respect to the human trafficking, the court found: “All these facts 
and circumstances, taken together, mean that in the opinion of the court there was an excessive 
situation, in which the physical and mental integrity and personal freedom of [E], [C] and [D] 
were seriously violated.” A was also found guilty of witness tampering.
The court found: “Although the court feels it has not been proved that the defendant intended 
the death of [W] on [the date of W’s death; BNRM], it finds that the defendant’s role during the

preceding period of neglect and escalating violence was substantial”. A was sentenced to three 
years and nine months in prison, far less than the sentence imposed on the parents.

B – the employer/master of the house
B was found guilty of human trafficking and accessory to intentional witness tampering.75 He 
received a prison sentence of two years and three months. Although B knew of the assault on 
W, the court found that it had not been proved that B had personally beaten W.
A and B are in India and their sentences have consequently still not been enforced.

C – W’s mother
W’s mother was convicted of: (charge 1, primary) murder; and (charge 2, primary) accessory to 
premeditated grievous assault, committed against her child.76 She received a prison sentence of 
eight years. Her defence of psychological inability to resist failed. She was also deemed crimi-
nally responsible. C’s special duty of care towards her daughter and the very serious offences 
justified an unconditional prison sentence, in the court’s view. The fact that C was a victim of 
human trafficking as well as an offender did not lead to the application of the non-punishment 
principle, although it was a mitigating circumstance. On this point the court found: “The court 
also takes into account the circumstances under which the defendant lived in the Netherlands. 
[…] She found herself […] in the Netherlands in a situation which the court in a judgment 
given today has decided involved exploitation. […] On that ground the court assumes that the 
escalation of the violence committed against [W] by the defendant was encouraged by the said 
specific context within which the defendant lived in the Netherlands with her daughter.

D – W’s father
W’s father was convicted of (charge 1, subsidiary) accessory to premeditated grievous assault, 
causing death, committed against his child; (charge 2, subsidiary) accessory to premeditated 
assault committed against his child, multiple offences.77 He received a prison sentence of six 
years. D’s defence of psychological inability to resist failed although the court found on this 
point: “[A] and [B] were convicted of exploitation of the defendant by the court in a judgment 
rendered by the court today. The defendant was therefore certainly in a weak, dependent posi-
tion. In the court’s opinion, however, the defendant could have resisted the pressure to allow 
the assaults to continue.”
In the grounds for its sentence the court argued, on the one hand, that the special duty of care 
resting on the parents, the serious shock caused to society, the fact that D allowed his own 
interests to prevail over the interests of his daughter and the very serious nature of the offences 
justified a lengthy and unconditional prison sentence. As in the case of W’s mother, the fact 
that he was a victim was a mitigating circumstance. 

E – the cousin
The cousin E was convicted of: (charge 1, second alternative) accessory to serious premedi-
tated assault, causing death; (charge 2) in the cases in which a legal rule demands a statement 
under oath, verbally, personally and intentionally making a false statement under oath; and 
(third alternative) accessory to premeditated assault, multiple offences.78 Specifically, E passed 
on instructions to beat W to the other defendants and gave C the stick with which W was as-
saulted. She herself did not assault W. E was also convicted of perjury. In the grounds for the

sentence for perjury the court said: “Since the defendant […] was demonstrably under enor-
mous pressure from the fellow defendants to give the replies they required to questions from 
the Dutch authorities, the court has attached considerable weight to this fact in imposing the 
sentence.” A and B were sentenced for witness tampering. In the judgment in A’s case the court 
found: “[…] the court finds that it can also be declared proven that the defendant, together with 
her husband, intentionally spoke to [E] with the aim [“manifest”] of influencing her freedom 
to make a truthful statement.” The judgment in B’s case states: “He thereby wanted to ensure 
that said persons would make statements in favour of the defendant and his wife in the present 
case.” Although it was proved that E made false statements under pressure from A and B, this 
did not lead to the application of the non-punishment principle, although the perjury did not 
play a major role in determining the sentence.
Her plea of self-defence and psychological inability to resist failed, although the court did find 
she was slightly less criminally responsible. As regards the reduced criminal responsibility the 
court found: “The circumstances under which the suspect lived here in the Netherlands play a 
major role in this. It is clear that she lived here for a long time in a very dependent and subor-
dinate position, with scarcely any privacy, while violence was also used against her. The court 
will take this into account in imposing sentence.”
The fact that E was a victim and was young79 constituted mitigating circumstances with re-
spect to all of the offences. She received a prison sentence of three years.

The judgments in first instance were appealed, but the appeals had not yet been completed at 
the time of writing80.

In this case, there is a link between the offences committed by the three victims and the 
situation of human trafficking. This can be derived, for example, from the judgment in B’s 
case, where the court found as follows: “The court does feel it is relevant that the situation of 
exploitation underlying the proven human trafficking must also be deemed to have created 
a breeding ground for the ultimate violence towards [W].” The victims were in a situation 
of exploitation and to a large extent dependent on A and B. The initiative for the abuse of W 
came from A. The question is to what extent the three victims committed, or permitted, the 
assaults under pressure from A, and to a lesser extent from B? To what extent was it their 
own choice? E, in particular, who committed no assaults personally but was found by the 
court to have provided the stick with which W was beaten and to have passed on to C the 
instructions she had received by telephone from A, does not seem to have played a major role 
in the mistreatment. Nevertheless, she was heavily criticised for her actions and received a 
prison sentence of three years. Interestingly, the prison sentence that E received was only a 
few months shorter than the prison sentence imposed on A, the defendant who gave instruc-
tions for the assaults and was found guilty of human trafficking.
In view of the nature and seriousness of the offences, there were good reasons for prosecut-
ing the three victims. It is remarkable, however, that there is no reference to the non-punish-
ment principle to be found in any of the judgments, although the fact that C, D and E were 
victims did constitute mitigating circumstances.

79 The court found that it was plausible that E is far younger than her passport says.

6.3.1 Consequences under immigration law for victims who are suspects

When undocumented victims are suspected or convicted of a crime, it can have practical 
consequences for the rights of residency, temporary or otherwise, to which they are entitled 
by reason of being victims of human trafficking. The following case illustrates this.

Case of undesirable alien81

E, from India, who also figured in the previous case, was a victim of human trafficking. The 
court, however, sentenced E to a prison term of three years as an accessory to grievous assault 
causing death, and for perjury.
As a result of these events, E suffered psychological problems (PTSS). In prison she received 
psychological help. E’s lawyer invoked the B9 regulation for his client, since she was a victim of 
human trafficking and was the only defendant to cooperate with the police and the public pros-
ecution service. The IND made no decision on this request. After E had completed her prison 
sentence, she was immediately transferred to aliens’ detention. E was declared an undesirable 
alien because of her conviction for the above offences.82 Because of her conviction, E was said 
to constitute a threat to public order and should be deported. Her lawyer appealed. More than 
a month later, the district court decided that E’s detention was unlawful83 and E was released. 
However, she had never lived independently. E was still very young when she came to the Neth-
erlands, where she was locked up and exploited for years. E went from this situation to prison 
and from prison to aliens’ detention. She was now suddenly on the street without being able to 
speak the language and without any financial means. E was finally able to find temporary lodg-
ings with two women she knew from prison. Because she had been declared an undesirable 
alien, E did not receive the help and shelter to which she was entitled under the B9 regulation 
as a victim of human trafficking.
Meanwhile, E could not return to India because of serious threats made by her human traffick-
ers who are living in India.84 She had no right to shelter or help in the Netherlands. An appeal 
had been filed in the human trafficking case against A and B and the public prosecution service 
wanted E to remain available for this appeal.
Her lawyer requested that the order declaring her an undesirable alien be lifted. Three months 
later, the preliminary relief judge suspended the declaration against E. The judge found, inter 
alia: “In the court’s opinion, however, in the decision declaring [E] an undesirable alien of 17 
March 2008 the respondent wrongly failed totally to address the fact that the petitioner is a 
victim of human trafficking […]. The respondent should, partly in view of its policy of protect-
ing victims of human trafficking (B9, Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000), expressly 
consider in weighing up the decision that the petitioner’s former employers were sentenced in 
judgments of the criminal division of this court on 14 December 2007 for, inter alia, human 
trafficking, partly on the grounds of incriminating statements made by the petitioner. They are 
living in India. They have appealed against these sentences. The petitioner fears reprisals on 
the grounds of everything that has occurred in the past between her and her former employers 

81 This case was also discussed in the previous section (§6.3).
82 A declaration that a person is an undesirable alien on the basis art. 67 section 1 opening lines, under c of the 

Aliens Act: “I. Our Minister may declare an alien to be undesirable […] c. if he constitutes a danger to public 
order or national security and does not have legal residence as referred to in article 8, under a to e inclusive 
or l;”

83 The Hague District Court, 29 April 2008, AWB 08/13151.
84 A and B left the Netherlands when their provisional custody was lifted. They were sentenced in absentia.

233

and on the grounds of their social position in India. At the hearing, the petitioner’s attorney 
submitted a letter from the sub-district court in The Hague of 28 May 2008 showing that the 
public prosecution service also wants the petitioner to be available on appeal for the investiga-
tion to find the truth. The respondent must explicitly consider the interests of the petitioner as 
a victim of human trafficking and the interests of the Dutch state in combating human traffick-
ing in his decision to declare her an undesirable alien.”85

Despite the suspension of the declaration that she was an undesirable alien and the fact that she 
met all the requirements for the B9 residence permit, E was not granted B9 status. As a result, 
E had no shelter or psychological care.

There are three aspects to this case that need to be distinguished: the right to temporary resi-
dence on the basis of the B9 regulation, the declaration as an undesirable alien and continued 
residence. E met the requirements for a B9 residence permit. She was a victim of human traf-
ficking and cooperated with the criminal investigation into her traffickers. The authorities 
also wanted her to remain available as a witness for the appeal in the case. However, because 
E was declared an undesirable alien because of the offences she committed in her situation 
of exploitation, she was not granted B9 status. The question is whether this is desirable and 
correct. In a recent advisory report on its interpretation of the B9 regulation, the Advisory 
Committee on Migration Affairs (ACVZ) explained: “Criminal antecedents should not be 
used against an applicant in so far as they are directly connected with the offence for which 
she is charged.”86 In the present case, there is a clear link between the offences committed 
by E and the situation in which she was exploited. Clearly, every victim that cooperates with 
the criminal investigation against the human trafficker should be able to claim his or her 
rights under the B9 regulation. E was the only one of the three victims to cooperate with the 
criminal investigation. Her cooperation with that investigation made a significant contribu-
tion to the conviction of the two human traffickers. The victims’ interests in receiving help 
and shelter and the interests of effectively combating human trafficking should weigh more 
heavily than the immigration-law interests of not awarding B9 status.
E was declared an undesirable alien. As the preliminary relief judge said, the fact that E was 
a victim should have been explicitly considered in the decision to declare her an undesirable 
alien, as well as the fact that E feared for her life if she was sent back to India. These factors 
should also have been taken into account in a decision on continued residence.

Case of theft I
A young Mongolian woman (D) was arrested in the Netherlands for shoplifting. During ques-
tioning, D declared that she was forced to commit the theft. However, she provided so little 
accurate information about the person she claimed had coerced her that the police were unable 
to do anything with the information and D had to pay a fine for the theft. Because D was living 
illegally in the Netherlands, preparations were made for her repatriation. During the interview

reaction to the ACVZ advisory report, see the text box in §5.2.1 of this report.

with D, the Return and Departure Service (DT&V) found indications of human trafficking. 
When DT&V persisted with the questioning, it emerged that a gang had forced D to work as a 
prostitute and commit thefts in the Netherlands. D ultimately reported the human trafficking. 
She was admitted to the B9 scheme. Because of her conviction for shoplifting, however, there 
is a good chance that D will not be granted continued residence, according to her social worker. 
The case against the human traffickers was still proceeding at the time of writing.

Besides the sexual exploitation suffered by D, the thefts that D had to commit can be de-
scribed as exploitation in crime. D’s conviction did not prevent her being granted temporary 
residence under the B9 regulation; however, it is still unclear whether D will be granted con-
tinued residence if her trafficker is convicted. Because of her criminal antecedents, arising 
from the thefts committed under compulsion, there is a chance that D will be declared an 
undesirable alien and will consequently not be granted continued residence. It is difficult to 
understand how a person can be a victim of exploitation in crime and at the same time be 
regarded as an offender because of that same offence and consequently be denied the pos-
sibility of continued residence. The fact that the victim was exploited in crime should be an 
important consideration in deciding on a request for continued residence. It is not enough 
simply to refer to a criminal conviction.

Case of theft II
P was a Serbian woman who fell into the hands of a human trafficker in the Netherlands, who 
forced her to commit thefts and pick pockets. After some time, he also forced her to work as a 
prostitute.
N was usually a look-out during the thefts and P always has to surrender the proceeds to him. 
P was arrested and convicted of theft several times, but she did not tell the police that she was 
a victim of human trafficking, so that fact was not taken into account in the prosecution. P 
was declared an undesirable alien because of her convictions. When P appeared in court again, 
some time later, in connection with thefts, she told the judge that she was a victim of human 
trafficking. Because P only mentioned that she was a victim of human trafficking for the first 
time at that hearing, and had not made a complaint at that time, the possibility that she was 
a victim was ignored. P ended up in prison again. While in detention she made a complaint 
of human trafficking. Although P met the conditions for B9 status, the fact that she had been 
declared an undesirable alien made it difficult to grant her B9 status. The relevant public pros-
ecutor for human trafficking cases pushed hard for it, however, and the declaration that P was 
an undesirable alien was suspended and she was granted temporary residence on the basis of 
the B9 regulation. P entered a shelter.
It proved difficult for P to break loose from her trafficker, for whom she had worked for years. P 
repeatedly contacted N from the shelter. N blackmailed her. The pattern of committing thefts 
also proved difficult to break. At a certain point, P was caught in the act of shoplifting. Because 
N was not there, P had committed the theft without coercion by N. P was convicted and im-
prisoned.
Meanwhile, the public prosecution service had started an investigation into N’s involvement in 
human trafficking and thefts. At the time of writing, it was not yet clear what offences N would 
be charged with.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

235

There are some parallels between this case and Theft case I. The thefts that P committed 
under pressure from her human trafficker can also be described as human trafficking in the 
sense of exploitation in crime. As in the previous case, in being granted B9 residence status, 
P’s position as a victim prevailed over her criminal antecedents.
When P applies for continued residence, however, her suspended designation as an unde-
sirable alien could prove an obstacle. P not only committed offences under coercion, but 
also later committed thefts independently. The question is to what extent she can be entirely 
blamed for that. Victims of human trafficking regularly lapse back into a former pattern 
when they are in an aid programme, and the same can apply for criminal behaviour.

Aliens who commit offences that are related to the human trafficking situation face the risk 
of becoming victims twice over. As well as a conviction, they also face the risk of being de-
clared an undesirable alien and consequently being placed in aliens’ detention with a view to 
deportation.87 Every victim who cooperates with the criminal investigation should be able to 
claim the B9 regulation. Even if the victim’s criminal antecedents have no direct relationship 
with the human trafficking, they should not prevent them from claiming their rights under 
the B9 regulation. A person’s status as victim and the relationship between the offence and 
the human trafficking situation should be explicitly taken into account in the decision to de-
clare a victim an undesirable alien and subsequently deporting them.

6.4 Comparison with system in other countries

This section looks at the legislation and practice relating to the non-punishment principle in 
several European countries. The law and its application in practice in other European coun-
tries could provide leads for Dutch legislation and policy. The countries discussed are Bel-
gium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Italy. For the purposes of this analysis, we 
studied the legislation in these countries and interviewed the public prosecution service and 
NGOs about the application of the non-punishment principle in practice. This is also a quali-
tative study. The countries were selected to include a combination of European countries in 
which prosecution is based on the principle of legality and the principle of expediency, coun-
tries that are party to the Council of Europe’s Convention and some that are not and coun-
tries that have specific rules for victims who commit offences and countries that do not.

6.4.1 Belgium

Legal framework
As in the Netherlands, Belgium applies the principle of expediency with regard to the prose-
cution of offences. Belgium ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action to Com-
bat Trafficking in Human Beings in April 2009.88 In addition to the scope afforded by the 

87 See also Boermans (2009).
88 Date of ratification: 27 April 2009. Date of entry into force: 1 August 2009.

236

principle of expediency, it is possible under Belgian law not to prosecute or punish victims 
of human trafficking who have committed crimes in the human trafficking situation. There 
are two provisions of Belgian law that apply specifically to victims of human trafficking who 
have committed offences. 
First, paragraph 6 of the Minister of Justice’s directive entitled ‘Policy on the investigation 
and prosecution of human trafficking’ states: “Although it is possible that persons who are 
exploited in the context of human trafficking are not in compliance with the social legislation 
or the legislation concerning access to, residence in and establishment on the territory of our 
country, account must always be taken of the fact that they are first and foremost victims of 
forms of crime that must be tackled with priority.”89 Although the terms of this provision do 
not expressly state that victims may not be punished, that conclusion can be drawn from the 
fact that the importance of tackling human trafficking takes precedence over the prosecution 
of the victim. The directive is limited to violations of social and immigration law. The direc-
tive contains no further conditions for the applicability of paragraph 6. The provision can be 
seen as a non-punishment provision. The directive is addressed to judges and is not binding. 
However, any derogation from the guideline ‘must be supported by reasons’,90 which means 
that in principle the directive will be applied in practice.
Exploitation in crime is one of the forms of human trafficking explicitly criminalised in Article 
433quinquies (1) (5) of the Belgian Criminal Code, which entered into force on 12 September 
2005.91 According to the explanatory memorandum, this is a modern form of human traffick-
ing, established by case law with respect to drug dealing and theft.92 According to the text of 
Article 433quinquies (5) (“in order […] to cause this person to commit an offence or a crime 
against his will.”) exploitation in crime is not limited to these two offences. It seems reason-
able to assume that victims of exploitation in crime will not be prosecuted in Belgium, since 
when an offence against that clause has been established it is also clear that the perpetrator of 
the offence is a victim and not an offender. The annual report of Belgium’s Centre for Equal 
Opportunities and Opposition to Racism (CGKR) says of point 5: “This should make it pos-
sible for potential victims to be recognised as victims and not as perpetrators of a crime.”93

Prosecution and non-punishment in practice
As described in the previous paragraph, Belgian legislation creates possibilities for not pros-
ecuting victims of human trafficking for criminal offences they have committed in a situa-
tion of human trafficking. In practice, however, there seem to be differences when it comes

girls were enticed to Belgium by promising them work as housekeepers but were then forced to steal. See

to deciding whether or not to prosecute victims. The interviews with the relevant agencies 
in Belgium and a study of a number of case files identified the three most common types of 
cases. They will be discussed briefly below.

Former victim becomes a human trafficker/madam
In the first place, there were a number of cases where Nigerian women were found guilty of 
human trafficking although they themselves had formerly been victims of human traffick-
ing.94 These cases involved sexual exploitation. A situation that regularly occurs is that the 
victim, after years of being exploited in the Belgian sex industry, is able to free herself from 
the exploiters either by ‘buying her freedom’ or by entering a social programme and making 
a complaint against the human trafficker. After following a social programme and cooperat-
ing with the investigation of the human trafficker, the victim ultimately receives a residence 
permit. After some time the woman then herself recruits victims from Nigeria and exploits 
them in the sex industry.95

The outcomes of the cases studied in which former victims of human trafficking were them-
selves prosecuted for the offence differ. All four cases that were studied96 involved Nige-
rian woman who were convicted of human trafficking. In contrast to the cases studied in the 
Netherlands,97 the women operated not as executors but as madams. What is striking is the 
role played in the sentencing by the woman’s previous status as victim. In two cases (involv-
ing three defendants), the fact that they were former victims played no role in the sentencing. 
In one case, the former status as a victim was a mitigating factor: “The court also takes into 
account that the first defendant was initially herself a victim of exploitation, so that part of 
her sentence can be suspended.”98 In another case, their past as victims of human trafficking 
actually led to a heavier sentence for two defendants: “Nonetheless, the fact is that she was 
herself a victim of such malpractices, so she should have been more aware than anyone of the 
offence she was committing against her victims.99

Although only a few judgments were studied, it also became clear from the interviews that 
former victims who are guilty of human trafficking are usually prosecuted. The greatest dif-
ferences in practice seem be in sentencing, although since each of the cases studied is unique 
no straightforward comparison can be made between them. The interviewees also disagreed 
on this point. While some said that a former victim should actually be punished more severe-

94 For more information on this subject, see also §9.4.6, §9.5 and §6.3 of this report. 
95 Since these are offenders who were no longer victims at the time of the offence, strictly speaking this cat-

egory falls outside the scope of the non-punishment principle. However, because the dividing line between 
victims and offenders is not always clear with this category of former victims, and the two ‘roles’ are some-
time closely intertwined, they are nevertheless interesting.

ly, others could imagine that a lighter sentence would be more appropriate if the defendant 
had herself been a victim of human trafficking in the past.

Victim is found with false passport or false work permit
A second frequently mentioned category of case involved victims of human trafficking who 
were found in possession of a false passport or false work permit. As already shown in the 
earlier section on the legal framework, the directive on the investigation and prosecution of 
human trafficking should apply to this category of victim. Three cases were studied.

False documents case I
In a case in 2000, two Nigerian victims of sexual exploitation were discovered with false docu-
ments found during a control of prostitution and the police discovered that they had given false 
names. The victims were prosecuted. However, the sentences of both victims were suspended: 
“Taking account of: […] the defendant’s vulnerable position as a victim of human trafficking 
[…] there are reasons to give the defendant the benefit of the suspension.”100 Although the 
court regarded both women as victims of human trafficking, it is striking that their exploiter 
was not prosecuted for human trafficking; there was not even a criminal investigation of a sus-
pect. The victims were known to the social services as victims of human trafficking.

False documents case II
In another case, also involving two victims who used false documents, one of the victims co-
operated with the investigation of the human trafficker. For this reason, that victim was not 
prosecuted. The other victim refused to make a statement and would not ‘admit’ that she was 
a victim of human trafficking, and was consequently prosecuted in this case and sentenced for 
possession of a false passport.

False documents case III
A third case from 2007 involved a woman who, during a control of prostitution, was found 
with a false passport and also gave a false name. This woman had in the past been a victim of 
human trafficking in another city and was registered as a victim. Because the court could not 
establish with certainty that the offences for which she was arrested had not been committed 
under coercion, the woman was acquitted.

The picture to emerge from the cases outlined above and the interviews, together with an 
analysis of the directive on prosecution, is that victims of human trafficking who are rec-
ognised as such are, in principle, not punished for breaches of social and immigration laws. 
However, it is not entirely clear when a person is regarded as a victim. In the second case, for 
example, the prosecution of the victim simply proceeded because the victim did not identify 
herself as such and would not cooperate with the investigation. The identification of the vic-
tim is very important for the purposes of the directive on investigation and prosecution.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

239

Victim of other forms of exploitation is accused by exploiter
Third, the interviewees mentioned that it frequently occurs that victims of economic ex-
ploitation, when they leave their exploiter, are (falsely) accused of theft to assault by the ex-
ploiter, sometimes as revenge or as a deterrent to other victims. Because a prosecution of 
the human trafficker in the cases of economic exploitation are brought before the Labour 
Tribunal, while theft and assault cases are heard by the courts, the two cases are not joined, 
so victims face the risk that the fact that they are victims will not be taken into account in 
their prosecution. In that case, there will be no question of applying the non-punishment 
principle. In practice, social services do inform the magistrates of the connection with the 
human trafficking case, when they are aware of it. An additional problem for victims is that 
a conviction is a ground for not granting or extending a residence permit, since because of 
the conviction the victim represents a ‘a danger to public order’. Apart from prosecution and 
punishment, the victim therefore also faces the risk of being forcibly repatriated. As already 
mentioned in § 6.3.1, this is also a problem in the Netherlands. 

6.4.2 United Kingdom

Legal framework
On 17 December 2008, the United Kingdom ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention, 
which then entered into force on 1 April 2009. The United Kingdom adheres to the principle 
of expediency. In deciding whether to bring charges, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) 
follows the rules in The Code for Crown Prosecutors,101 which provide, briefly, that a suspect 
will be prosecuted if two requirements are met: (1) there is sufficient convincing evidence, 
and (2) prosecution is necessary in the public interest.
There are two specific protocols for the prosecution of victims of human trafficking who 
commit an offence. The first is entitled Prosecution of defendants charged with immigration 
offences who might be trafficked victims.102 This protocol provides that when the CPS has rea-
son to believe that persons who are suspected of offences against immigration rules are also 
victims of human trafficking and committed the offences ‘whilst they are being coerced by 
another’ it should consider not prosecuting them, given the absence of a public interest.
The second protocol is entitled Prosecution of young defendants charged with offences who 
might be trafficked victims.103 This protocol is aimed at young victims of human trafficking 
who have committed an offence ‘in a coerced situation’. If there is convincing evidence that 
the young offender can credibly invoke duress, the case should be dismissed on evidentiary 

101 The Code for Crown Prosecutors is a document that contains the general principles on which the CPS bases 
its decisions to prosecute. It is available online at http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/docs/code2004eng-

grounds. If the evidence of coercion is less convincing, further information should be sought 
to decide whether the public interest would be best served by dismissing the case. 
Both protocols can be regarded as non-punishment principles, since they create the pos-
sibility of not prosecuting victims of human trafficking who are suspected of committing 
an offence. On the one hand, the protocols go further than the non-punishment principle 
in Article 26 of the Council of Europe’s Convention, since they refer to prosecution rather 
than punishment. On the other hand, the protocols are more limited in the sense that the 
first protocol only refers to offences against immigration law and the second is confined to 
young people.

R v O
Both of these protocols came under the spotlight as a result of the notorious case of R v O.104 
This case centred on O, an underage Nigerian girl who was exploited in the sex industry in the 
United Kingdom. O was arrested by the British immigration service when she tried to escape 
from her human trafficker and flee to Spain. Although there were doubts about O’s age, no 
investigation was carried out to discover whether the girl was a minor (the police, the CPS and 
her own lawyer all disregarded the suspicion that O was a minor). Although the British NGO 
Poppy Project and O herself said that she was a victim of human trafficking, this claim was not 
investigated or taken into account in deciding whether or not to prosecute O. O was sentenced 
to eight months in prison. After her conviction, O hired a new legal team and appealed. The 
appeal court then ruled that both the CPS and lawyers must conduct ‘proper enquiries’ when a 
possible victim of human trafficking is being prosecuted. Poppy Project’s report on O’s status 
as a victim should have been taken into account, as should the two protocols for victims of hu-
man trafficking. Finally, the court in first instance and the CPS and O’s legal team were heavily 
criticised for not investigating whether O was a minor, a failure that constituted a violation of 
her right to a fair trial by the court of first instance, the appeal court found.

R v O sets a very important precedent for victims of human trafficking who commit a crimi-
nal offence. The judgment has drawn more attention to the two protocols in the UK, in the 
first place, by raising awareness of the two protocols in the CPS, so that this type of case is 
more likely to be dismissed. Another positive result of the case is that it will make lawyers 
more aware of the possibilities for victims of human trafficking who are prosecuted for an 
offence.

Prosecution and the non-punishment principle in practice
Although British legislation creates possibilities for not prosecuting victims of human traf-
ficking who have committed offences in certain circumstances, in practice these options are 
not always availed of. A major problem in applying the two protocols is the identification of 
victims of human trafficking.105 The two protocols are based on the principle that the suspect

105 This merged from interviews in December 2008 with the Crown Prosecution Service, Anti-Slavery Interna-

tional, Poppy Project, Ecpat UK and the UKTHC.

is also a victim. However, a suspect who is not known to be a victim will be prosecuted like 
anyone else, without the application of the protocols. In practice, victims do not always re-
veal that they are victims, often out of fear of the trafficker, for example. Lawyers sometimes 
advise their clients to invoke their right to silence, while other lawyers advise their clients 
to confess in exchange for a lighter sentence. If the suspect fails to explain why the offence 
was committed, it is difficult to discover that he or she is a victim. Other actors in the proc-
ess, such as the police, the CPS and the immigration service, are also not always sufficiently 
aware of possible indications of human trafficking and consequently fail to identify victims. 
Training of the police in how to identify signs of human trafficking106 and involvement of 
NGOs in efforts to recognise victims107 would improve the identification of victims.

Even when a person is identified as a victim, in practice the relevant actors do not all seem to 
be aware of the existence of the two protocols, so they are not always applied, as in the R v O 
case. However, the R v O case has increased awareness of the existence of the two protocols 
and their use. Although, according to interviewees, the protocols are now more widely used, 
there have still been cases where victims were nevertheless prosecuted and punished.

Case of Vietnamese boy (15) in cannabis plantation108

B, a Vietnamese boy, was only 9 or 10 years old when he left Vietnam to seek his fortune. After 
a number of detours he arrived in France, where he was recruited to work in a cannabis nursery 
in the United Kingdom. In the years following, B worked at various cannabis plantations. Dur-
ing a police raid on one of the nurseries, B was arrested. Although he was a minor and a victim 
of human trafficking, the CPS decided to prosecute B for working in the cannabis nursery. On 
the day of B’s trial, he was asked by his lawyer whether the CPS had consulted the UKTHC 
about whether B was a victim. It had not. An investigation by the UKTHC showed that B was a 
victim of human trafficking, whereupon the CPS decided to drop the case against him because 
the public interest was not served by his prosecution.

In the United Kingdom, it happens more often that minors – mainly Vietnamese – are recruit-
ed to work in cannabis plantations where they are exploited.109 It was this phenomenon, and 
that of underage Romas who were exploited by being coerced into committing thefts (picking 
pockets), that prompted the drafting of the second protocol. That protocol, and the attention 
drawn to it by the R v O case, have highlighted the possibility that these minors are victims of 
human trafficking. Interviewees say that the protocol is now followed more often.110

106 The UKHTC’s Prevention Group provides training for the police. Since April 2009 every new police officer 
follows a course on human trafficking.

tres.

109 This phenomenon is also not unknown in the Netherlands.
110 To identify possible victims, UKHTC reviews all cases of Vietnamese who are charged with involvement in 

cannabis-related cases to check whether they could be victims. If it suspects that they are, it informs the pub-
lic prosecutor concerned of the protocols, or if the case has already been heard if hires a lawyer for a possible 
appeal.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

242

Besides the fact that the protocols are not always used in the case of victims, another prob-
lem is that the first protocol only refers to offences against immigration laws, while the sec-
ond protocol is specifically aimed at minors. In other words, the protocols focus on specific 
categories of offences or victims. The principle of expedience, however, allows the CPS to 
decide whether to prosecute on a case-by-case basis. The protocols could therefore be ap-
plied by analogy to other categories of victims or offences. However, the threshold for decid-
ing to dismiss a prosecution is likely to be higher in a case where, for example, an adult victim 
commits a drug-related offence than if the offender is a minor. 
There is no binding obligation not to prosecute under the protocols. In practice, in every 
case the various interests are weighed in deciding whether to prosecute or not. According to 
some interviewees, if the CPS were obliged not to prosecute a victim of human trafficking it 
could foster possible abuses. Human traffickers could then take advantage of the protocols, 
by using minors as an instrument to commit offences, for example. The normative rather 
than mandatory nature of the protocols at least does not facilitate that.

Theft to escape a situation of exploitation
According to a British NGO, some victims become so desperate about a seemingly hopeless 
situation of exploitation that they go out shoplifting in the hope of being arrested and so being 
able to escape from the human trafficker. In such a case, it could be traumatic for the victim if 
he or she is then prosecuted. But since the shoplifting is not coerced it is difficult to apply the 
protocols. However, since it is not necessarily in the public interest to prosecute such victims, 
the CPS may decide not to prosecute them.

6.4.3 Germany

Legal framework
Germany had signed but not ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention at the time of writ-
ing.111 In Germany the legality principle applies, which means that in principle every offence 
will be prosecuted; however, there are exceptions to the ensuing requirement to prosecute. 
For example, the public prosecution service may dismiss a case on the grounds of Section 
154 Strafprozeßordnung (StPO): Einstellung wegen Gringfügigkeit when no minimum sen-
tence is prescribed for the offence, the degree of guilt is minor and there is no public interest 
in prosecution. Under certain – more stringent – conditions, prosecutions for offences for 
which there is a minimum sentence may also be dismissed.112 Although prosecution in Ger-
many is based on the legality principle, a significant number of cases are not prosecuted for 
reasons of expediency.113

Germany has no specific non-punishment provision for victims of human trafficking. With-
in the definition of labour exploitation, criminal exploitation is neither explicitly mentioned 

111 The time of writing was 23 July 2009. Germany signed the convention on 17 November 2005.
112 For more information on the exceptions to the legality principle in Germany, see Van Daele (2000).
113 In 2006, 31% of prosecutions were abandoned: Statistisches Bundsambt, 2008, p. 13.

243

nor explicitly excluded.114 It is therefore unclear whether criminal exploitation as a form of 
human trafficking falls within the scope of the German Criminal Code. In cases involving 
less serious offences, the public prosecutor can apply the general grounds of expediency to 
victims. The StPO also allows a prosecution to be dismissed when a person is coerced into 
committing an offence. By virtue of Article 154c StPO, the public prosecutor can drop the 
charges in such a case unless the seriousness of the offence does not allow it. This provision 
can also apply to victims of human trafficking.
When a person exhorts someone else to commit an offence, this can fall under the definition 
of incitement, so that the inducer will be punished as though he were the perpetrator.115 The 
person who was incited may be spared prosecution if he or she had no way of escaping from 
the situation.116 This is not often assumed, however. Cases of incitement are, in practice, ap-
plied mainly to children under the age of 14 because they cannot be prosecuted.117

Prosecution of the non-punishment principle in practice
In Germany there are three main categories of offence committed by victims of human traf-
ficking. First, victims commit offences against immigration law. These are usually committed 
by non-EU nationals who work on a tourist visa. The penalty for this offence is a fine. Since 
it is a minor offence, these cases are often dismissed on the grounds of Section 153 StPO. A 
second category of offence involves violations of tax law. Victims of sexual exploitation earn 
a lot of money, although they often have to surrender their income to their exploiters. Under 
the tax laws, prostitutes are required to pay tax; the failure to pay tax is a criminal offence. 
There have been cases in which a victim, having testified against her human trafficker, then 
received a huge tax demand on the basis of her statement. Although it is possible for the tax 
authorities to drop a claim, it often does not. Ignorance of human trafficking is an important 
reason for this. The authorities have recently become more aware of this problem and a dis-
cussion has started on the possibilities of formulating guidelines for tax claims against this 
category of victims.118

In addition to offences against immigration and tax laws, victims sometimes also commit 
more serious crimes. For example, there have been cases in Germany where a victim of sex-
ual exploitation recruited a new victim in order to buy her freedom.

Case of recruiting a new victim for prostitution
A, a Russian woman, was forced to work as a prostitute in Germany. To escape from the situa-
tion of exploitation, A made the following deal with her exploiter: if A provided a new victim to 
her exploiter, she could stop working as a prostitute and would be allowed to marry a German 

114 §224 Strafgesetzbuch (StGB).
115 §26 StGB reads in English: “Whoever intentionally induces another to intentionally commit an unlawful act, 

shall, as an inciter, be punished the same as a perpetrator.” 
116 See the similarity with causing the commission of an offence in the Netherlands, §6.2.2.

man in order to secure a residence permit. A agreed and went to the Ukraine where she induced 
victim D to work as a prostitute in Germany under false pretences. D, who had been told by A 
that she would be a dancer, was subsequently exploited.

In this case, A was not prosecuted because both she and victim D disappeared. According to 
the public prosecutor concerned, if A’s whereabouts had been known she would have been 
prosecuted. The following factors would have played a role in the decision to prosecute her: 
(1) recruiting D was not A’s only option for escaping from her situation – she could have 
run away; (2) D suffered badly; (3) A played an active role in the human trafficking; and (4) it 
was a serious offence. Accordingly, A’s status as a victim was not a factor in the decision to 
prosecute. The fact that A was a victim would have played an important role in the sentenc-
ing, since the public prosecutor would, in this case, probably have asked for a light sentence, 
part of it suspended.

6.4.4 Austria

Legal framework
Austria was one of the first member states to ratify the Council of Europe’s Convention.119 
The non-punishment provision in article 26 of this convention therefore applies in Austria. 
However, prosecution in Austria is based on the legality principle, so prosecution is manda-
tory. The fact that a suspect is also a victim of human trafficking does not constitute a ground 
for not prosecuting or not imposing a sentence. There are several exceptions to the legality 
principle. Austria complies with the terms of Article 26 because the general legal princi-
ples of Rechtsfertigende Notstand and Entschuldigender Notstand120 can also apply to victims 
of human trafficking. These principles allow the public prosecution service to decide not 
to prosecute if an offence was committed under a direct threat and if the offence was not 
disproportionate to that threat. The fact that a person is a victim is not in itself ground for 
declining to prosecute or impose a punishment in Austria.

Prosecution and the non-punishment principle in practice
By virtue of the legality principle, victims in Austria will, in principle, be prosecuted. Al-
though the simple fact of being a victim cannot lead to exemption from punishment, it can 
constitute a mitigating circumstance.

Case of assistance in human trafficking
C and M were two women from Romania. C worked as a prostitute in Romania; M did not. C 
and M were brought to Austria by four human traffickers. C knew that she would be working 
as a prostitute in Austria. M was not aware of this. C was instructed by the human traffickers

there on 1 February 2008.

to tell M that she would be a dancer in Austria. C followed these instructions and lied to M, 
who agreed to travel to Austria. When they arrived in Austria, both women were exploited in 
prostitution. They had to surrender most of their income to the four human traffickers and two 
operators who had ‘ordered’ the women from the human traffickers. They were also encour-
aged to use drugs. After several weeks, M was able to escape. She fled to the police and made 
a complaint of human trafficking. The police started an investigation, but the four Romanian 
human traffickers were able to escape abroad and were consequently difficult to trace. The two 
operators were placed in custody because of their involvement in human trafficking, but were 
released by the judge for lack of evidence.
C was also arrested on the basis of M’s statements. C was prosecuted for human trafficking.121 
She was given a prison sentence of 14 months (a large part of it conditional), slightly more than 
the minimum sentence of 12 months for the offence. In an interview, the public prosecutor said 
that the sentence was low by Austrian standards, partly due to the fact that C was herself a 
victim of human trafficking.

The irony of this case is that C, a victim of human trafficking, was the only person to be 
convicted. The four human traffickers and the two operators went free. The fact that C was 
a victim could not lead to the dismissal of the case or the application of the non-punishment 
principle in this case because of the application of the legality principle. As a victim, how-
ever, she did receive a far lower sentence than she normally would have. According to the 
public prosecutor in this case, a positive side effect of C’s prosecution is that her conviction 
could have a preventive effect by sending a warning to future potential victims.

Case of using a false passport
A was in her early twenties when she was brought to Austria from Romania under false pre-
tences and forced to work in prostitution. A was exploited, physically assaulted and raped. To 
escape from her traffickers, A tore up her (false) passport. During a control of prostitution, 
she was arrested because of her torn passport. A told her story when she arrived at the police 
station.
The police started an investigation into human trafficking. Despite her great fear of her exploit-
ers, A made statements against them to the police and in court. The suspects were ultimately 
acquitted because of a lack of evidence. A was the only victim who dared to make a statement 
against them. 
Several weeks later, A was summonsed for using a false passport. A told the judge that she had 
been forced to use the false passport. She was told that if she didn’t use the passport ‘she would 
regret it’. A told the court that she had deliberately torn up her passport in order to escape from 
her human traffickers by being arrested. The court, a different court to the one that heard the 
case against the human traffickers, did not accept A’s defence. A was given a prison sentence of 
one month, suspended for three years.

Once again, the victim was the only person convicted and punished in this case. The human 
traffickers went free and the victim disappeared behind bars. Although the victim said she 

121 Section 217 Strafgesetzbuch states that anyone who brings another person into prostitution in another state 
is committing an offence. This is criminalised in Article 273f (2) (3) Dutch Criminal Code.

was forced to use the false passport, the public prosecution service and the court failed to ap-
ply the principles of Rechtsfertigende Notstand and Entschuldigender Notstand and the victim 
was prosecuted in accordance with the legality principle. The fact that different courts heard 
her case and the human trafficking case had negative consequences for A. A’s case shows 
many parallels with R v O in the United Kingdom, but the outcome was different. It is harsh 
that a victim was imprisoned for a relatively minor offence, which was committed under 
coercion and which came to light because she tried to escape from her exploiters.
Victims in Austria regularly destroy their false passport in the hope of escaping from their 
exploiters by being arrested.122 There are indications that the police in Austria do not always 
report that the victim was using a false passport. When that fact does not appear in the of-
ficial report, the victim is not prosecuted. 

Apart from criminal prosecution, administrative sanctions are also sometimes used against 
victims of sexual exploitation. For example, every prostitute in Vienna is obliged to be reg-
istered. Any prostitute who is not registered may be fined. In principle, victims are not fined 
but those who carry out the controls of prostitution and impose the fines are not trained 
to identify human trafficking, so victims are regularly still fined, according to an Austrian 
NGO.123

6.4.5 Italy

Legal framework
Italy signed the Council of Europe’s Convention on 8 June 2005, but the Convention has not 
yet been ratified.124 Italian legislation has no specific non-punishment principle for victims of 
human trafficking who have committed an offence.
According to the legality principle, the public prosecution service is obliged to investigate 
every criminal offence. In principle, there are no exceptions to this, even for victims of hu-
man trafficking who commit offences under coercion by their exploiter. However, if a person 
is coerced into committing an offence, it may constitute a case of stato di necessità pursuant 
to Article 54 of the Italian Criminal Code (Codice Penale). The stato di necessità is similar 
to the ground of justification of necessity in the Netherlands. This provision is not aimed 
specifically at victims of human trafficking, but may apply to them. When the criminal inves-
tigation shows that the victim was confronted with a stato di necessità, the public prosecutor 
may ask the court to dismiss the case against the victim. If the court honours this request, the 
victim is not prosecuted. If the victim is prosecuted, he or she may be acquitted if the stato di 
necessità is established during the trial.

dom, where victims sometimes commit thefts in order to escape the human trafficking situation by being

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

247

Criminal exploitation falls within the scope of the definition of human trafficking in Articles 
600 and 601 of the Codice Penale. Article 12 (3) of law 1998/286 also makes the employment 
of children in crime a punishable offence within the definition of human smuggling.125

Prosecution and the non-punishment principle in practice
As in other countries, offences committed by victims in Italy frequently fall under the cat-
egory of migration-related crime, such as the use of false identity documents. Because there 
is often a clear connection between this offence and the human trafficking situation, these 
victims are generally not prosecuted because of the existence of a stato di necessità, or are ac-
quitted. In July 2009, Italy’s parliament approved a bill criminalising illegal entry and illegal 
residence. A large number of victims of human trafficking are living illegally in Italy and are 
punishable under the new law. This means that when the law enters into force there will be a 
substantial rise in the number of victims committing a criminal offence, which could create 
a problem in identifying victims. If they are initially regarded as suspects and immediately 
repatriated as prescribed by the law, there is a risk that they will already have been deported 
before it becomes clear that they are victims of human trafficking. According to several in-
terviewees, it is therefore essential to be alert to possible signs of human trafficking in the 
implementation of the law.

As in other countries, there have also been cases in Italy of victims of sexual exploitation 
recruiting new victims or being involved in human trafficking in other ways. The followings 
case illustrates this.

Case of issuing instructions in prostitution126

In this case in 2004, two 22-year-old Romanian women were exploited in prostitution in Italy. 
Their exploiter also forced them to issue instructions to younger prostitutes. This constituted 
an offence under Articles 3 and 4 of L 75/58 (pimping). The women also gave false identities to 
the police.
Because the public prosecutor felt that this case involved a stato di necessità, in view of the coer-
cion to commit the offences, he asked the judge to dismiss the case. However, the court rejected 
this request. The public prosecutor consequently had to prosecute the women for the two of-
fences, but the judge who heard their case found that they could not be convicted of the offence 
because, in his view, a stato di necessità did exist.

This case shows that if a prosecution of a victim is not dismissed, it is still possible not to 
convict the victim if there was coercion. Because of the legality principle, however, this deci-
sion always rests with the judge and not with the public prosecutor.
Another type of offence in which victims in Italy are regularly involved is theft, particularly 
pickpocketing. When victims are forced to commit theft, it is generally seen as human traf-
ficking in the sense of exploitation in crime, and it is unusual for victims to be prosecuted

for the thefts. The victims are frequently underage Roma children.127 Children under the age 
of 14 cannot be prosecuted in Italy, while older victims can often successfully invoke stato di 
necessità, whereupon the case will be dismissed or there will be no conviction.

Case of theft under coercion
R, from Albania, was a minor when she was sold by her parents to C. R lived under slave-like 
conditions with C and was exploited by him in the household. C also forced her to commit 
several thefts.
R testified about the human trafficking in C’s trial. C countered with the argument that R’s 
testimony was not credible because she had committed thefts. He submitted a love letter as an 
exhibit. The love letter, written by R, said that she had committed the thefts voluntarily.
The judge did not believe C and found that the letter had been written by R under coercion by 
C. C had forced R to commit the thefts in order to undermine the credibility of her future tes-
timony against him because of her criminal antecedents. C was convicted of human trafficking. 
R was not prosecuted because a stato di necessità was assumed to exist. 
C appealed right up to the Supreme Court. Both the appeal court and the Supreme Court 
upheld the earlier judgment.

This case highlights an important problem relating to victims who are offenders. If a victim 
is or was a suspect, the victim’s testimony against the human trafficker has less value128 and 
additional evidence has to be provided. On the grounds of Article 192 in conjunction with 
Article 197bis of the Codice Penale, the public prosecutor must furnish additional evidence 
if the witness is (or was) a suspect in a criminal investigation. This rule applies even if was 
decided not to prosecute the victim. The possibility of successfully prosecuting a human 
trafficker declines if the victim is suspected of an offence. This could, in theory, encourage 
human traffickers to force their victims to commit crimes, but it is difficult to demonstrate 
whether this actually happens. One of the interviews revealed that in fact, despite the legality 
principle, a public prosecutor will in practice not order a criminal investigation into offences 
committed by a victim, which avoids potential problems with a witness.
At the time of writing, there was a bill before the Italian parliament to make it a criminal 
offence to sell and buy sexual services in public places. Under local regulations, prostitutes 
and clients can already receive an administrative fine in some cities. The interviewees did 
not expect any problems for victims of human trafficking if this bill is adopted since victims 
actually work at less visible locations, while the bill is specifically intended to address street 
prostitution.

lighted in this chapter.

Victims as perpetrators and the non-punishment principle

249

International legislation devotes a lot of attention to the problems facing victims of human 
trafficking who have also committed, or are suspected of committing, offences – and the 
related principle that in certain circumstances they should not be prosecuted or punished 
(the non-punishment principle). At the same time, it is clear that the scope of this principle 
has not yet been fully defined, as is apparent from the varying definitions of the principle 
in the different international instruments. Non-punishment principles in international in-
struments relating solely to migration-related crime are very limited and do not cover the 
problems facing victims of human trafficking who are involved in various types of offences 
in a human trafficking situation, which is often the case, as shown by the cases studied in the 
Netherlands and several other countries.

The Netherlands has opted not to adopt a specific non-punishment provision for victims 
who are also suspects. However, there are various options available in the Netherlands for 
not prosecuting these victims, or not punishing them. When implementing the non-pun-
ishment principle in legal practice in the Netherlands, the interpretation of the principle in 
the various international legal instruments can be referred to. To avail of the options arising 
from the non-punishment principle, however, it is important that victims are also identified 
as such by all of the relevant agencies in the chain. In practice, it is difficult to identify indi-
viduals as victims of human trafficking, particularly in the case of victims who are initially 
suspected of an offence committed in the human trafficking situation. Furthermore, the risk 
of prosecution may cause victims who are suspected of an offence to see themselves more as 
an offender than as a victim and not to make a complaint. Even if a person is identified as a 
victim, the relevant actors are in practice not all aware of the legal possibilities not to punish 
or prosecute the victim. Awareness of the problem and knowledge of the legal possibilities 
are therefore important if the possibilities arising from the non-punishment principle for 
victims are to be applied in practice.

Exploitation in crime is a form of human trafficking that is not always recognised as such. 
BNRM is particularly aware of cases of exploitation in crime involving offences against the 
Opium Act committed under coercion or pressure by victims of human trafficking. For exam-
ple, victims of loverboys and other human traffickers are sometimes forced to commit drug-
related offences. Minors are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in crime; thefts and drug-
related offences, in particular, seem to occur more often among this category of victims than 
other offences. This might be connected with the different system of sanctions for minors.

It is important to be aware that offences committed by victims are not always committed 
under coercion. A victim sometimes commits an offence, such as shoplifting, for example, 
precisely in order to escape from the human trafficker, as has occurred in the UK. There is 
also the case in Austria, in which a victim destroyed her passport for the same reason. How 
this problem should be dealt with is an issue that needs to be addressed. 

Offences committed by victims in the human trafficking situation can have consequences 
not only under criminal law, but also under immigration law. For example, BNRM is aware 

NMR Ch06.indd   249 09-06-10   00:06

of a case of a convicted victim who was not granted B9 residence status even though she co-
operated with the criminal investigation into her human traffickers, who were, in fact, also 
convicted.

Another problem is that victims who are also offenders, and have been convicted, face the 
risk of being declared undesirable aliens and consequently being placed in aliens’ detention 
and deported. The possible consequences under immigration law for the residence status of 
victims who are also offenders are therefore another point of concern.

Administrative enforcement and  

the integrated approach to human trafficking  
(in the sex industry)

7.1 Introduction

There is a growing realisation that criminal law alone is not sufficient to tackle (organised) 
crime and that an administrative and integrated approach is essential. But what does this 
administrative approach entail with respect to human trafficking? What types of integrated 
approach are there? This question is discussed in further detail in this chapter. Human traf-
ficking in this context concerns human trafficking in the sex industry, although this is not 
necessarily always the case in practice.
Since this chapter is primarily concerned with the sexual services industry, the develop-
ments in this industry will first be addressed. The administrative approach to organised 
crime (§7.3) and human trafficking (§7.4) is then discussed, followed by administrative en-
forcement in the licensed prostitution sector (§7.5). Finally, integrated approaches to human 
trafficking, specifically the programmatic approach (§7.6.1) and the chain approach (§7.6.2), 
are discussed.

7.2 Developments in the sexual services industry

This section describes developments in the sexual services industry, which is defined as mak-
ing oneself available to others for the performance of sexual acts in exchange for payment; 
in other words, prostitution.
The second evaluation of the lifting of the ban on brothels indicated that unlicensed (ille-
gal) prostitution also occurs alongside licensed establishments and forms of prostitution 
for which no permit is required. Although the evaluation concluded that the legal prostitu-
tion sector is larger than the illegal sector,1 in a Rotterdam study researchers reached the 
conclusion that the illegal prostitution sector was at least as large as the legal sector in that 
municipality.2 Illegal prostitution takes place under the cover of other industries and in sec-
tors that are difficult to monitor, such as massage parlours, beauty parlours, tanning salons, 
couples’ clubs, saunas and erotic cafes. At the same time, the escort sector and the home-and 
hotel-based and online prostitution (webcam sex) industries are growing. A few new forms

of sexual services are described in further detail below, followed by a description of activities 
initiated by the sector itself to combat human trafficking.

Thai massage parlours
Prostitution in Thai massage parlours is nothing new: the NRM’s fifth report also discussed 
this type of sex work. However, the enormous turnover in this area – in terms of the growth 
in the number of parlours and the rate at which they spring up and disappear again – is strik-
ing. Concrete data on these establishments and their employees are scarce, and because of 
this, a 2008 project conducted in these parlours by the Rode Draad (an organisation that 
advocates the rights of sex industry workers) deserves attention.
Prompted by the conspicuous number of Thai massage parlours and the conditions encoun-
tered in these parlours by its field workers, the Rode Draad visited 63 Thai massage parlours 
in the Netherlands. These visits yielded a great deal of information about the situation of the 
employees of these parlours. Of the 150 businesses of which the Rode Draad was aware, 62 
had already shut down by the time the project was carried out,3 which is indicative of their 
turnover rate. The Rode Draad’s report of this project makes a distinction between tradi-
tional and erotic massage parlours. At traditional parlours, especially, field workers found it 
difficult to determine whether or not the parlours hosted prostitution, forced or otherwise. 
This was, firstly, because there are different views on what is considered sex and, therefore, 
prostitution. Customers, but also masseuses, often do not regard so-called ‘happy endings’ 
(manual stimulation to the point of orgasm) as sex. If sex acts (illegal or otherwise) are per-
formed in a traditional massage parlour, it is often unclear whether the masseuses them-
selves choose to offer these services for the extra income. The field workers of the Rode 
Draad did detect a number of signs of abuses and exploitation, such as women who had 
immediately started work upon their arrival in the Netherlands and a woman with bruises 
on her arms. Some women admitted they had been brought to the Netherlands by human 
traffickers long ago. They often incur enormous debts in order to come to the Netherlands: 
amounts of €40,000 and fl.60,000 to fl.80,000 were mentioned in interviews with these 
employees. Rode Draad field workers regarded the position of many of the Thai women as 
bad: the women were under pressure from their families in their home country, were ex-
tremely loyal to the parlour owners, spoke hardly any Dutch and had no prospects for the 
future. Some women sought refuge in gambling and drugs (this was encountered in three 
parlours). Many of the women did have some knowledge of the human trafficking problems 
but talked about it as if it were something that happened elsewhere.
A journalist for the free weekly newspaper NL70 visited seven Thai massage parlours in The 
Hague and discovered that Thai massage parlours were indeed a cover for prostitution in 
many cases. He also detected signs that could indicate forced prostitution. For instance, a 
masseuse in one of the parlours thanked him for not requesting any sexual acts, unlike ‘most

reports. The Rode Draad does not guarantee the completeness of this list.

men’. In two other parlours, he was invited to choose from a number of masseuses, a few of 
whom seemed very fearful, the journalist said.4

In a response to written questions posed by councillors following this article (among other 
things), the municipal executive of The Hague stated that all of the massage parlours visited 
for the purposes of article were licensed sex establishments and that since the monitoring 
policy aimed at investigating every indication of illegal prostitution had been stepped up in 
March 2008, only one massage parlour (Chinese) had been found to be operating without 
the required permit. The municipal executive reported that the joint approach by the mu-
nicipality of The Hague and the police helped track down approximately 70 cases of illegal 
prostitution each year.5

Chinese massage parlours, beauty parlours and manicure salons
Knotter, Korf and Lau published a study into illegal Chinese aliens in the Netherlands in 
February 2009. This study devoted considerable attention to aspects of exploitation, pros-
titution and crime, primarily in beauty and massage parlours. Of the 15 establishments in-
vestigated on suspicion of illegal practices, eight were incontestably shown to employ illegal 
aliens. Five others remained suspect but no evidence of illegal practices was found. The re-
searchers found that a possible reason for the growing number of illegal Chinese in the beau-
ty salon sector was the tightening up of checks in the hospitality industry. Many restaurant 
owners no longer dare hire illegal Chinese immigrants. In addition to legitimate business, 
the authors stated that forced and voluntary prostitution was also conducted in the dozens 
of nail salons and beauty and massage parlours found primarily in the large cities. Despite 
reports from neighbourhood residents and complaints of rape and exploitation from pros-
titutes, the police rarely investigate this sector. Interviews with police officers indicated that 
this was because these investigations are not a priority, the reports of human trafficking are 
not always credible and forced prostitution is not the primary activity of the suspects and the 
reports are therefore treated as tangential information.6 It is striking that Chinese victims 
of a human trafficker (‘the snakehead’) do not see the trafficker as a criminal at all but more 
as a hero or someone to whom they owe a great deal. Illegal Chinese also seldom talk about 
exploitation, which, the authors state, is also due to the working conditions in China.7

Reports in the media created a commotion in The Hague. The newspaper Trouw devoted 
extensive coverage at the end of 2007 to Chinese women engaged in illegal prostitution in at 
least six Chinese beauty and massage parlours in The Hague. According to insiders, women 
regularly ‘disappeared’ from such parlours and new girls appeared almost weekly. The reti-
cence of these women (prompted by the fear of deportation) has prevented social workers

from getting a grip on this group of prostitutes, although the report of human trafficking 
by one Chinese masseuse resulted in the arrest of the Dutch owner of a massage parlour on 
charges of sexual exploitation in February 2008. The masseuse claimed that she was pres-
sured to perform sexual acts and to surrender half of her income. The fact that the owner 
in this case was a Caucasian Dutch person is a new development. Chinese women usually 
work in businesses with Chinese owners.8 Non-sexual exploitation in Chinese massage and 
beauty parlours is discussed in Chapter 12.

Bulgarian and Romanian hairdressers and beauticians:
The research agency Ultrascan asserts that at least 80% of the Bulgarian and Romanian 
women registered with the Chamber of Commerce as hairdressers or beauticians work as 
prostitutes. The number of Bulgarian business starters recently increased seven-fold, to 
1,600 in the space of a year, while the number of Romanians starting their own business 
tripled. Ultrascan says the Chamber of Commerce figures are wrongly regarded as an in-
dicator of emancipation, because many of the women are coerced into the work they do.9 
The IND has also detected abuses among Bulgarians and Romanians who register with it as 
self-employed (see §8.3.1).

Illegal prostitution in hotels
Illegal prostitution in hotels seems to have increased since the ban on brothels was lifted, due 
to technological developments and other factors.10 This kind of prostitution can take various 
forms. There are prostitutes who rent a hotel room and work from this location. Some pick 
up guests in hotel bars. Yet others are ordered by hotel guests. And there are organisations/
brokers that rent hotel rooms and set up prostitutes there. This last form seems to occur pri-
marily at chain hotels on major arterial roads and motorways where guests and other visitors 
are less conspicuous. The women who work or are put to work there are advertised via the 
internet, with a mobile phone number that can be called to make an appointment, and the 
customer visits the prostitute at the hotel. Sometimes a room is rented for a longer period 
of time. Prostitutes might be forced to prostitute themselves at these hotels. The question 
is to what extent hotel employees are aware of the prostitution or coercion and to what de-
gree they are complicit by acting (in a paid capacity) as middlemen. The Vereniging voor Ex-
ploitanten Relaxbedrijven (VER) (the Dutch association of brothel owners) sent a letter to 273 
hotels operated by 13 chains in March 2008 warning about the creation of a ‘business within 
your business’; in other words, the facilitation of commercial prostitution in hotel rooms.

8 Various articles on illegal prostitution in Chinese beauty and massage parlours in The Hague appeared in 
Trouw between 22 December 2007 and 8 July 2008. The fate of one Chinese woman in particular was the fo-
cus of these articles. In November 2008 four Chinese human traffickers in The Hague, Rotterdam and Delft 
were arrested for forcing women in massage parlours and nail salons into prostitution. (Chinezen gepakt 
voor mensensmokkel, De Telegraaf (Haaglanden), 5 November 2008).

The escort sector is difficult to regulate and monitor, in this form too. Nevertheless, it is 
important to gain control over this sector because underage prostitutes and victims of hu-
man trafficking can otherwise be put to work here unimpeded. A pilot project is being con-
ducted (see §7.6.1) to combat illegal hotel prostitution. In addition to instituting criminal 
investigations, the aim is to make recommendations for a preventive, administrative, fiscal 
and civil-law approach. In the meantime, the hotels linked with these abuses have themselves 
also taken action to combat illegal prostitution and human trafficking: a protocol for hotel 
personnel is being developed with the goal of better and more rapid identification of human 
trafficking.11

Online prostitution
The use of the internet for the provision of sexual services continues to grow and in its sec-
ond evaluation of the lifting of the ban on brothels, the WODC mentioned it as one of the 
reasons for the declining number of licensed sex establishments.12 The WODC also stated, 
however, that the spread of webcam sex is not a particularly Dutch development and has to 
be attributed to the increased possibilities offered by the internet rather than the lifting of 
the brothel ban.13

Two distinct uses of the internet in relation to sexual services can be identified: (1) prostitutes 
working from home or escorts using the internet to find customers, and (2) the performance 
of sexual acts in front of a webcam. While the latter (also called webcam sex) is not regarded 
as prostitution, it is regarded as sex work and often takes place without payment. Figures 
from the Rutgers Nisso group indicate that engaging in online sex is popular among both 
men and women.14

In their study into customers of prostitution, Zaitch and Staring distinguished between three 
types of prostitution-related websites. First they described (commercial) websites on which 
prostitution is offered, either by the women themselves or otherwise. A second category 
includes websites that give general information about prostitution. These websites serve to 
educate and support prostitutes and can be a source of information for others. The third 
category of websites consists of pages for customers of prostitutes, for reflection and infor-
mation, such as www.hookers.nl and www.ijsberen.nl.15 The WODC’s evaluation reports 
that this last category of websites is relatively new and the use of such websites has increased 
significantly.16

– KLPD), the industry association for sex businesses (Vereniging Exploitanten Relaxbedrijven – VER) and 
human trafficking experts (Expertise Centre on Human Trafficking and People Smuggling – EMM).

12 The WODC made a general comparison based on reports from municipalities and concluded that the 
number of sex establishments had declined by one-sixth between 2000 and 2006. The WODC says this con-
clusion is consistent with experiences reported by business operators and prostitutes, as well as with what is 
described in the report from the Rode Draad (Altink & Bokelman, 2006). Source: Daalder (2007).

Prostitutes who find their customers via the internet and receive customers at home, a hotel 
or an apartment are not required to surrender money to brothel keepers and can therefore 
work more inexpensively than colleagues in other parts of the prostitution industry. Another 
advantage of working via the internet is anonymity, say prostitutes. Anonymity for those 
who work at brothels and clubs can no longer be guaranteed since many municipalities have 
now set up cameras in the vicinity of sex establishments. This anonymity also entails risks, 
however: social workers have hardly any access to these prostitutes and they are not known 
to the authorities.

Turkish hospitality sector
Prostitution in Turkish hospitality establishments, such as cafes and coffee houses, is a well-
known phenomenon.NRM3 Prostitution or the brokering of prostitution takes place at these 
establishments. Most of the prostitutes involved are from Bulgaria.

Window prostitution
An increasing number of municipalities (Amsterdam, Alkmaar, Arnhem) are curbing win-
dow prostitution, using the BIBOB Act (the Public Administration (Probity Screening) Act) 
to regulate window prostitution.17 Prostitutes, owners of brothel windows and other parties 
involved in the industry are opposed to the planned closures. The Rode Draad says one of 
the most important criteria for prostitutes in choosing a work place is the degree of inde-
pendence if offers and it is unrealistic to expect women to trade in their window for work 
at a club.18 This picture is confirmed by the initial results of a study by Bureau Beke, which 
conducted an extensive survey of the prostitution sector in Amsterdam for the municipal-
ity of Amsterdam (Care and Community Services and the Public Order and Safety depart-
ment). The initial results from the part of the study dealing with the effects on prostitutes of 
closing the windows were published in the report ‘Weg achter het raam’ in February 2009.19 
Based on interviews with experts, prostitutes and police representatives and observational 
investigation in Amsterdam, the authors formulated seven scenarios for the possible effects 
on prostitutes.
The authors concluded that women would not stop working when the windows were closed 
down. The majority of the women would rent a window from other sex business operators in 
Amsterdam, preferably in the same neighbourhood because of the atmosphere of the area, 
along with the independence and relatively good income. Only a small fraction would turn 
to the escort business or window brothels in other cities. These prostitutes are extremely 
unlikely to seek work at clubs due to the costs that must be paid to club owners and the rules 
these owners can impose. It is primarily the sex business operators who remain who would 
benefit from the closing of windows, since they would be able to demand more money and

would be assured of a higher rate of use. An operator would also have to make less of an ef-
fort to ensure the commitment of the women who rented windows. Prostitutes are feeling 
the effects of this, primarily because the quality of the rooms has declined and operators 
offer less protection. The prostitute’s position has deteriorated as a result. The Rode Draad 
also reports that waiting lists for windows have risen as a result of the closures. Women with 
a ‘protector’ can reportedly pay to move up the waiting list faster.20

The fact that some prostitutes are leaving the industry is due to the fact that there are more 
programmes aimed at helping them do this, say the researchers, and not the result of the 
closing of windows, although the closures could given an extra push in that direction.
The researchers were unable to gain a clear impression of whether there has been a shift 
towards illegal/underground forms of prostitution. For the time being, no clear connection 
can be established between the closing of windows and any increase in alternative forms of 
prostitution.21

Streetwalker zones
On the instruction of the municipality of Nijmegen, the firm of Oostveen Beleidsonderzoek 
en Advies evaluated the municipality’s streetwalker zone but also included the developments 
in other municipalities in its study. This evaluation indicated that municipalities have differ-
ent ways of dealing with streetwalker zones.22 Between 2003 and 2006, the municipalities of 
Amsterdam,23 The Hague, and Rotterdam shut down their streetwalker zones and Nijmegen 
has plans to do the same. The aim of these closures was to reduce the nuisance and crime and/
or encourage prostitutes to seek assistance. The effects of closing the streetwalker zones in 
The Hague were monitored and evaluated during the first six months after they were closed. 
This evaluation showed a decline in the nuisance in and around the former streetwalker 
zones and an extremely limited movement of the street prostitutes to surrounding areas. 
Prostitutes from the streetwalker zone have made much use of the 24-hour assistance that 
was set up under the direction of the Stichting Hulpverlening Opvang Prostituees (SHOP), 
although the evaluation also indicated that the relief and assistance is not reaching all the 
women from the former streetwalker zone.24 Interviews with prostitutes and the director 
of SHOP in The Hague’s newspaper for the homeless, Haags Straatnieuws, confirmed that 
closing the streetwalker zone in The Hague had the effect of shifting the prostitutes to the

tutes have either departed to other cities or remain invisible in The Hague. Source: Letter from the mayor to

‘hustling circuit’. The women cannot work behind brothel windows because the rent is too 
expensive or the illegal status of the women makes this impossible.25

The Rotterdam streetwalker zone was characterised by a high percentage of addicts (90%). 
The municipality is trying to accommodate all these addicts in protected living projects and 
offer them work after they receive treatment at a clinic. Of the 270 women known to have 
worked the streetwalker zone, 11% were not receiving treatment or had dropped out of the 
picture entirely ten months after it was closed.26 A far higher percentage of the non-addict 
street prostitutes from The Hague and Rotterdam (as compared to the addicts) have moved 
their activities to other municipalities.27

Eindhoven has opted for an approach based on ‘social design’, whereby students of the 
EindhovenDesignAcademy were asked to think of an alternative approach to street prosti-
tution in the municipality. The municipality chose the ‘life-force’ approach from the plans 
proposed,28 a customised approach in which women work to improve their position with the 
guidance of a personal coach. By participating in constructive and positive activities (for ex-
ample coaching talks and workshops) the prostitutes earn credits that enable them to make 
purchases from the municipality. The ultimate goal of the project is to educate prostitutes 
and enable them to lead an independent life, preferably without drugs or prostitution, so that 
the streetwalker zone can be shut down in 2011.29

Other municipalities (such as Utrecht, Arnhem, Heerlen and Groningen) have no plans to 
close the streetwalker zones. Periodic evaluations indicate that the zones satisfy the goals 
(limiting nuisance and enabling better care and assistance for the prostitutes). With the ex-
ception of Groningen, all the zones require prostitutes to register and carry identification 
cards in order to reduce the influx from outside.30

Escorts
Amsterdam commissioned its second study into the local escort industry in 2007,31 which 
provides some insight into the development of the industry. A total of a hundred interviews 
were held with people from the industry itself (escort business operators, escorts, taxi driv-
ers, lobby organisations) but also with professionals who have contact with the industry 
(investigative authorities, government, support workers and lobby organisations) and cus-
tomers (both direct customers and indirect customers, such as hotel doormen). This study 
indicated that the expected growth in the industry has indeed taken place, even when the

figures are corrected for the increased accessibility of the escorts due to the increase in in-
ternet use.
The report distinguishes four segments of the escort industry: two larger segments (the 
women-for-men segment and the men-for-men segment), and two small segments, consist-
ing of transsexual escorts and gigolos (men-for-women). The study showed the structure of 
the market in each segment. Both the price category in which the escorts work (high – mid-
dle – low) and the way in which the escorts work (independently – via agencies – for a pimp) 
were examined.
Within the women-for-men segment, the main growth was in the cheaper end of the market, 
which is where signs of human trafficking are mainly found. Romanian women dominate 
the women-for-men market. It is mainly these women who tend to be victims of coercion 
in Amsterdam. The researchers were surprised at how many signs of involuntary prostitu-
tion were relatively easy to perceive in the field and the lack of regulation by or contact with 
investigative authorities. The study therefore recommended proactive inspections and more 
investigations. Escorts in closed circuits (usually ethnic catering establishments), which the 
researchers in this study could not gain access to, deserve special attention in order to pre-
vent this from becoming a ‘new pipeline’ of the prostitution sector, the researchers said.32

Human trafficking seems to occur rarely if at all in the men-for-men, transgender and gigolo 
segments.
The term ‘Amsterdam escort industry’ is, incidentally, extremely relative: some of the play-
ers active in Amsterdam are not established in Amsterdam at all. About half of the work that 
the Amsterdam agencies arrange takes place far outside Amsterdam. The study therefore 
emphasised the need to tackle the escort industry nationally. Because a licensing require-
ment for the agencies alone would cause a shift towards seemingly independent escorts, the 
regulation of independent operators (perhaps by means of an identification card system) is 
therefore also necessary in order to provide support.

Male prostitution
Male prostitution differs from the female variety in a number of ways. A first difference is 
the double taboo that surrounds male prostitution, since it not only involves prostitution, 
but also homosexuality. Problems with drugs, health, education, work and the law or emo-
tional problems often underlie work as a prostitute and can result in a third taboo. Because 
of these taboos, male prostitutes are even more concerned with anonymity than their female 
counterparts. It is impossible for them to work in areas where registration is required. Men 
even avoid streetwalker zones because of the risk of being recognised. They therefore work 
primarily via the internet. Club owners say many boys under the age of 18 can also be found 
online. During a conference of prostitution policy in The Hague in 2008,33 it emerged that 
the customers of male prostitutes also suffer from taboos. People who attended this confer-

ence said that customers of male prostitutes do not file a report if, for example, when (?) they 
are robbed by the prostitute (or one of the youths accompanying the prostitute).
Recent research into abuse and prostitution among youths indicates that contrary to expec-
tations, few underage Moroccan youth work in prostitution. The distorted view seems pri-
marily to have been created by the prostitutes themselves: they often pretend to be younger 
than they are and pass as ‘Moroccan’ since this is more in demand on the market. The youths 
interviewed had, incidentally all had experience with prostitution before they came of age.34

Campaign against pimps
In August 2007, the Rode Draad and Vakwerk started a campaign against pimps. Prostitutes 
were given stickers and posters to put on their windows telling pimps to get lost and pointing 
out that human trafficking is a criminal offence. Under the motto ‘pimp free zone, pimp-
ing is forbidden in the Netherlands’, the organisations and women hope to make the pimps 
nervous; they are under no illusion that the campaign will be enough to get rid of pimps.35 
According to a spokesperson for the Rode Draad, the campaign has had various effects, in 
addition to much media attention. The distribution of posters gave some indication of which 
women were being handled by pimps, since such women could or would not take the mate-
rial. In addition, it served as certification for some customers who only wanted to frequent 
women who had a pimp-freezone sticker or poster in the window. Sister organisations in 
Poland had plans to adopt this sticker campaign although it is unclear whether this plan ac-
tually got off the ground. The posters and stickers are also used by schools in projects and 
informational efforts and they are seen as a cult item in American prisons.36

No prostitutes under the age of 21
Window-business operators in The Hague signed an agreement in 2008 that they would no 
longer allow girls younger than 21 to work the windows. This was an effort to prevent exploi-
tation by pimps. Many prostitutes who are exploited by so-called ‘loverboys’ are between the 
ages of 18 and 21. From the age of 21 women are considered less vulnerable to loverboys. The 
initiative by the operators in The Hague was intended as a first move towards national leg-
islation to ban prostitution under the age of 21. Opinions on this are divided however. Some 
municipalities and political parties champion such a measure, while opponents state that it 
will mainly drive prostitutes into illegal status.

7.3 Administrative approach to organised crime

7.3.1 Policy developments

The public prosecution service and the police are responsible for the penal approach to (or-
ganised) crime, but municipalities do have possibilities to frustrate crime using administra-
tive measures – by creating or changing conditions so as to reduce the opportunities for 
organised crime or make it less appealing.37 The preventive and administrative approach to 
organised crime, one of the pillars of the Programme to Strengthen the Approach to Combat-
ing Organised Crime,38 is being given more concrete form in the Administrative Approach 
to Organised Crime programme.39 The role of the local administration in fighting organised 
crime is central in this programme, along with cooperation and the exchange of information. 
The approach clusters problems and solutions into six categories: 1) the organisation of the 
administrative approach, 2) obtaining and using relevant information, 3) pilot projects for 
operational applications through the administrative approach, 4) international cooperation, 
5) raising awareness and 6) safeguarding knowledge and expertise. A few measures from 
this programme are discussed below; others are addressed in other parts of this chapter, 
where relevant.

Regional Information and Expertise Centres (RIECs)
The Administrative Approach to Organised Crime programme provides for, among other 
things, the establishment of 10 regional information and expertise centres (RIECs) charged 
with supporting municipalities in preventing and reducing organised crime.40 The RIECs 
constitute an information interchange where information from various enforcement and 
investigation services is compiled and analysed in order to get a picture of the local interac-
tion between the underworld and legitimate society and to be able to advise on combating 
this. Municipalities are also supported in the use of BIBOB and instruments are developed 
for sectors and industries that fall outside the scope of the BIBOB Act. In fleshing out these 
tasks, the RIECs will work with relevant partners, including municipalities, the police, the 
public prosecution service, the tax authorities and the various investigative services. The 
RIECs will also contribute to fighting human trafficking. While all RIECs are scheduled 
to be operational in 2009,41 how they will work exactly has not yet been determined, as the

40 The regional centres are managed by a police force manager.
41 The progress report on the Human Trafficking Force’s action plan shows that the RIECs are still busy start-

ing up and there is still no question of an integrated local approach based on a platform function. The quick 
win that was formulated with respect to the ‘link between RIEC and EMM’ has also not progressed as far 
as expected. A pilot project relating to this quick win will start shortly in a number of RIECs. (Human Traf-
ficking Task Force, 2009b).

centres are still being developed.42 A national centre for information and expertise will also 
be set up.

Model covenant
In September 2008, the Administrative Agreement on an Integrated Local Approach to Or-
ganised Crime and corresponding model covenant were adopted to promote cooperation 
and the exchange of information between public authorities, the police, the public prosecu-
tion service, BODs, and the tax authorities. These documents provide a basis for informa-
tion to be exchanged without objection from the Dutch Data Protection Authority. Experi-
ences with the covenant will provide the basis for further investigation into whether other 
measures, such as amendments to legislation and regulation, are necessary.

Administrative reports
In addition to the RIECs, the Administrative Approach to Organised Crime programme 
proposes other measures to improve information available to the administration and the ex-
change of information with partners in the chain. One of these measures is the improvement 
of what are known as administrative reports. Investigations sometimes uncover information 
that is relevant for the administrative authorities, by creating a clearer picture of factors, 
individuals or agencies that encourage and/or facilitate crime, for example. An integrated 
approach requires that police and the public prosecution service inform the public admin-
istration about this. The administrative report was introduced for this reason. It is a writ-
ten notification from the police to the municipal authority that in the course of their duties 
under criminal law the police have stumbled upon facts and circumstances relevant to the 
municipal administration. The municipal government can then, if necessary, take appropri-
ate administrative measures. These reports are an important element of the integrated and/
or administrative approach to organised crime and attention to this has therefore increased 
significantly. The police currently do not have sufficient capacity to prepare administrative 
reports and the quality of the reports needs to improve.43 There are also signs that the mu-
nicipal administration does not always respond to administrative reports, although this situ-
ation is getting better.44

42 The expertise centres are expected to fulfil a supra-regional function and collect and share information at 
national level. At the same time, the expertise centres have to meet regional needs adequately. To maximise 
the match with the regional needs, it was decided not the prescribe a uniform embedding model, but to allow 
freedom in the structure of the RIECs. When the pilot phase is over, whether there is a need for uniform 
embedding will be reviewed again. Source: Administrative Approach to Organised Crime Programme (ap-

A number of activities have been undertaken to resolve these and other bottlenecks. How 
administrative reports can be improved is being looked into,45 a course is being developed 
to train police in preparing administrative reports, administrative reports are being drawn 
up more frequently (in the context of the programmatic approach) and financial resources 
for information officers at the public prosecution service and capacity in the police force 
are being made available to perform analyses with an administrative perspective.46 The ad-
ministrative reports that are drawn up by the police and the follow-up to them will also be 
investigated.47 The intention is that from 1 January 2013, every situation in which there is a 
permanent risk of crime will be examined to see whether an administrative report is neces-
sary, and if so they will actually be drawn up.48 This is in addition to other initiatives that are 
being developed to improve the municipal government’s position with regard to the infor-
mation it possesses.49

Preventive screening of potentially vulnerable sectors
This screening is designed to map parts of the business sector that are susceptible to influ-
ence from organised crime and can be used to work out measures to reduce or eliminate any 
vulnerabilities. In recent years, the transport and cannabis sectors, among others, have been 
screened on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. There are also plans to screen policies, regula-
tions and projects to analyse their susceptibility to abuse by organised crime.50

7.3.2 Administrative instruments

Municipalities have various instruments under administrative law to counter criminal activi-
ties at local level. The BIBOB Act, for instance, applies to certain industries, including the 
sex industry. But there are other instruments as well, which are discussed in this section.51

45 One of the quick wins in the Human Traffikcing Task Force’s action plan was to establish criteria for an 
administrative report. The progress report on the action plan stated that the basic conditions for the instru-
ment had been further elaborated and refined. Consideration is being given to aiming for a standard proce-
dure in terms of their form and content. Source: Human Trafficking Task Force 2009b.

Bye-laws and permits
On the local level, a municipality can make use of various permits and bye-laws to counter 
crime, including general municipal bye-laws.52 The general bye-laws enable municipalities to 
require permits for certain industries, allowing the municipality to screen these industries 
and if necessary refuse or revoke a permit. Businesses may also be shut down on the basis of 
the nuisance bye-law.53 An example of this is the Haarlem sex club, Esther, where the bodies 
of four murdered men were found, which was shut down by the city’s mayor in 2000. From 
the perspective of nuisance, a removal order for a designated area may also be included in 
the general bye-laws. The possibility of preventive body searches and placement of cameras 
in prostitution zones – which a number of municipalities make use of – are set down in the 
general bye-laws.

General bye-laws in Alkmaar
The municipality of Alkmaar has used the general bye-laws to ‘make it difficult for pimps and 
their accomplices.’54 In order to prevent or limit the nuisance that accompanies window prosti-
tution, and particularly the peripheral phenomena related to it,55 Section 3.2.6, subsection 2 of 
the general bye-law prohibits anyone from ‘involving one’s self with a prostitute in a coercive 
manner in any way in a public place’.56 The explanatory notes to the general bye-law states that 
“to involve oneself in a coercive manner” is defined as, among other things: ‘escorting prosti-
tutes more or less coercively to their work place, accepting money from prostitutes, providing 
a prostitute with alcohol or narcotics, acting aggressively towards a prostitute, etc.’ According 
to the explanatory notes, this subsection therefore primarily addresses the behaviour of pimps, 
but of course applies to anyone who satisfies the description.57 People who involve themselves 
with a prostitute in a coercive manner of this nature can be ordered by a police official to ‘im-
mediately remove themselves in a particular direction’ according to subsection 5 of the same 
section.58

Municipalities can also adopt a planning policy in relation to certain activities (by means of 
the zoning plan). The zoning plans can be adjusted to move unwanted economic activities 
out of an area.

52 These bye-laws and permits are not all arranged in the same way in every municipality. And not every mu-
nicipality uses all these permits and bye-laws. There is local autonomy in this area. On the grounds of Article 
149 of the Municipalities Act, the municipal council issues those bye-laws it deems necessary in the interests 
of the municipality. This article, together with Article 108 of the Municipalities Act, provides the legal basis 
for the municipal autonomy to adopt rules in the interests of the management of the municipality. In adopt-
ing the rules, the maximum legal limits (superior legislation) and the minimum legal limits (the privacy of the 
citizen) must be taken into account.

53 This can be a separate bye-law or part of the general bye-laws.

The government feels that scarce housing should be allocated in a balanced and equitable 
manner, which is why parliament passed the Housing Allocation Act in 1993, following ear-
lier, similar, laws in this area. The point of departure for this law is the freedom of citizens to 
settle where they want. At the same time, the law enables municipalities to lay down rules for 
the allocation of housing. One of the instruments that municipalities can use for this purpose 
is the housing permit, which can, for instance, be revoked if illegal prostitution takes place in 
a home. A recent amendment to the Housing Allocation Act is discussed in Chapter 2.

With just a few exceptions, every municipality has laid down rules in its general bye-laws 
regarding prostitution and sex establishments, whether or not based on the model bye-law 
of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG). Requiring a permit for a sex estab-
lishment is a very common stipulation in the general bye-laws, as are the conditions under 
which operators can obtain a permit and conditions relating to the operation of the business. 
Most municipalities have also laid down rules governing the enforcement of the prostitu-
tion rules on regulations and the sanctions for violations in the general bye-laws, and it may 
stipulate a maximum number of permits that can be granted. Municipalities that strive for a 
zero-tolerance policy sometimes stipulate that no more than one permit will be granted, in 
order to discourage prostitution in the municipality.59

Permits may also therefore be refused on the grounds of local general bye-laws. The munici-
pality of Nijmegen, for instance, refused to grant a permit for the operation of a window-
prostitution business. The local general bye-laws stipulated that a permit could be refused 
if there were indications that the sex business involved persons in violation of Article 250a 
of the Dutch Criminal Code.60 The municipality based its refusal in this case on police in-
spections that had ascertained violations of the Foreign Nationals (Employment) Act and 
the Aliens Act at the sex establishment in question. The manager’s defence, that he could 
not be blamed because he was not present at the time of the inspections, was unsuccessful. 
The court ruled that the relevant general bye-laws established joint responsibility on the part 
of both the operator and the manager to set up operations in such a way as to permanently 
guarantee supervision of the state of affairs in the sex establishment.61

Administrative fine
The Public Nuisance (Administrative Fine) Act) (the BBOOR Act)62 and corresponding 
BBOOR Implementation Decree63 took effect on 14 January 2009. The law, laid down in 
Articles 154b et seq. of the Municipalities Act, gives municipalities the independent author-

59 Francq et al. (2007, pp. 411-526).
60 Remarkably enough, the general bye-law (and the court) refer to Article 250a (old) Dutch Criminal Code 

(which had already lapsed at that time) and not to the applicable human rights article, Article 273f Dutch 
Criminal Code.

ity to take action against common minor violations of the general bye-laws and the waste 
substances bye-law that cause a nuisance.64

The explanatory memorandum to the BBOOR Decree indicates that this power applies for 
violations of all provisions of the general bye-laws, with a few exceptions for more serious 
and dangerous actions, violations that fall under the powers of the police and actions that 
are closely related to criminal law. These exceptions, cited on a ‘negative list’ in Article 2 of 
the Decree, include violations of a prostitution bye-law adopted in accordance with Section 
151a (1) of the Municipalities Act. With respect to prostitution, the negative list pertains ex-
clusively to regulations concerning the exploitation of prostitution. Other municipal regula-
tions concerning prostitution, such as a local streetwalking ban, do fall under the regime of 
the administrative fine.65

The BIBOB Act
The Public Administration (Probity in Decision-Making) Act (the BIBOB Act) is an impor-
tant administrative instrument for fighting crime, including organised crime. Screening in 
the context of the BIBOB Act is aimed at preventing municipalities from inadvertently facili-
tating or supporting criminal activities by means of permits and subsidies. The Berenschot 
consultancy firm evaluated the BIBOB Act three years after its introduction.66 The munici-
pality of Amsterdam also evaluated the BIBOB Act as it is was applied in that city.67

Berenschot’s research showed that 16% of the administrative bodies surveyed had experi-
ence with inadvertent criminal facilitation.68 Although implementation of the BIBOB Act 
was slower than the legislature expected, the number of recommendations issued has in-
creased over the past few years.69 The law applies mainly to licensing and, more specifically, 
when municipalities grant permits to hospitality establishments, ‘coffee shops’ and estab-
lishments for prostitution. Of the 265 recommendations issued in 2008, 34 were related to 
sex establishments. It is unknown to what extent these cases involved a serious danger, or 
any danger at all.70 Amsterdam, which makes some use of the Public Administration Probity 
Screening Agency (Bureau BIBOB), created 124 BIBOB files for prostitution-related busi-

70 In a general sense, Bureau BIBOB observed in 2008 that in 179 cases there was some danger that a decision 

could be used to commit criminal offences. In 113 cases, it was a ‘serious danger’. The Bureau concluded in 
its annual report that municipalities were therefore well able to assess when they needed the advice of Bureau 
BIBOB.

nesses (window brothels, private clubs and sex establishments). Eighty-three of these files 
were submitted to the National Bureau BIBOB on the advice of the Coordination Office. 
In 74 of these cases, the National Bureau BIBOB issued a recommendation, and warned of 
‘serious danger’ in 59 cases’. The recommendations from the National Bureau BIBOB were 
subsequently reviewed by the Amsterdam Coordination Office. In eight cases in which a 
recommendation was issued warning of some degree or a serious degree of danger, the rec-
ommendation was not followed up on.71

Berenschot’s research also showed that the law is used to a lesser extent to revoke permits 
already granted. One-fifth of the respondents said they felt the BIBOB Act had a preventive 
effect. Administrative bodies said it would be advisable to extend the BIBOB Act to cover 
call shops, employment agencies and the property sector.
Berenschot said that case law on the application of the BIBOB Act gives little reason to doubt 
the legal tenability of the law or the care with which screening takes place. Still the law has 
raised questions that were subsequently put before the court, with regard to the reliability of 
the information on which a BIBOB recommendation may be based, for example.

Information from the Criminal Intelligence Unit
The Council of State’s Administrative Law Division issued two rulings on 27 February 2009 
on the use of information originating from the Criminal Intelligence Unit. One of these rulings 
concerned a case in which the appellant had been refused an operating permit for a prostitu-
tion establishment because of a serious risk that the permit would be used in the ‘trafficking 
of women.’ The Bureau BIBOB came to this conclusion on the basis of information from the 
Criminal Intelligence Unit, which in this could not verify the reliability of this information. 
Since the reliability of the information could not be verified, it had less significance than it 
would have had if its reliability could have been confirmed in some other way. This informa-
tion could only be treated as substantial if it was combined with other, similar information that 
was clear and convincing and that could be directly traced back to the person concerned. The 
division found that was not the case in this situation.72

In the second ruling, the division saw no grounds for the court’s finding that information reg-
istered by the Criminal Intelligence Unit could only provide significant support for a serious 
suspicion (as referred to in Article 3 (2) BIBOB Act) if it was in connection with convictions or 
transactions or investigations and prosecutions in the same area. This kind of information only 
yields sufficient grounds for a serious suspicion in combination with other facts and circum-
stances that point in the same direction, since the reliability and relevance of the information 
from the register cannot be established with certainty. The weight attributed information reg-
istered by the Criminal Intelligence Unit can differ from one situation to another, depending 
on, among other things, the number of registered pieces of information, the assessment of the 
reliability of the source or sources, the specificity of the registered information, the date of the 
registered fact and anything else that is known about it. The division found that the Bureau BI-
BOB’s findings, on which the municipality’s decisions were based, did not sufficiently support

the conclusion that there was a serious danger that the permits would be abused. The decisions 
should therefore not have been based on the recommendations from the Bureau.73

With these rulings, the division significantly tightened the requirements for the use of infor-
mation from the Criminal Intelligence Unit, by also requiring additional evidence (depending 
on the nature of the information). This additional evidence must be convincing, clear and di-
rectly traceable to the party or parties involved.

The municipality of Amsterdam often uses the BIBOB Act as an administrative instrument 
to reduce the organised crime behind sex businesses. The Administrative Law Division 
ruled in relation to the refusal of an operating permit for the sex business Yab Yum that 
unlike information from the Criminal Intelligence Unit’s register for serious crime, the reli-
ability of police updates and the significance that can be attributed to them is not deemed 
sufficient without underlying documents. The division ultimately concluded that the refusal 
of the permit was justified on other grounds.74 After the business had been closed by the 
municipality, Yab Yum was able to continue as an escort business, since at the time escort 
businesses in Amsterdam were not required to have a permit.

Another ruling was made by the District Court of Alkmaar in a case in which the municipality 
of Den Helder refused a permit under the Licensing and Catering Act because of a recommen-
dation from the Bureau BIBOB, which indicated a serious risk based on the very serious sus-
picion that the applicant (a window operator) had some relationship with human trafficking.75 
According to the recommendation, this extremely serious suspicion was based on, among 
other things,76 the finding that the applicant for the permit was involved in hiring illegal pros-
titutes. The judge in interlocutory proceedings concluded that although the administrative fine 
on the grounds of a violation of the Foreign Nationals (Employment) Act is a punitive sanction, 
no criminal offence was involved. The court stated that such a violation does not pertain to the 
relationship between the applicant for the permit and his or her possible engagement in human 
trafficking.

There has been criticism of the BIBOB Act from various bodies. On the one hand, because 
of the serious consequences of the screening. Antecedents or business ties with criminal ele-

74 Council of State, Administrative Law division, 8 July 2009, LJN: BJ1892. The division found that the acqui-

sition of Yab Yum had taken place in the face of threats against and possible extortion of its former owner. 
The Administrative Law division found that there was a link between the Hells Angels and the threats and 
possible extortion under which the acquisition was made. This link between the Hells Angels and Yab Yum 
continued. According to the division, the municipality had sufficient evidence to ‘reasonably suspect that the 
Hells Angels had been involved in the acquisition of Yab Yum, that with the acquisition Yab Yum had fallen 
under the influence of a criminal circuit of which the Hells Angels were part and that this was masked by the 
involvement of the current operator of Yab Yum’.

76 The petitioner was also once heard as a witness in a human trafficking case, was registered in the register of 

robberies and was regarded as armed and dangerous.

ments is sufficient for a permit to be refused; it is not necessary to persuade and prove, as in 
a criminal case.77 Professor of Constitutional and Administrative Law Overkleeft-Verburg 
argues that BIBOB, in fact, results in business and professional disqualifications, thereby 
putting the constitutional right to property and freedom of profession, service provision and 
entrepreneurship under pressure.78

On the other hand, the law reportedly has a limited effect in the fight against criminal ac-
tivities like human trafficking. Experiences in Limburg and Amsterdam indicate a ‘waterbed 
effect’ when the BIBOB Act is applied: criminals shift investments to business premises for 
which no permit is necessary and to which BIBOB does not apply. The Van Traa team in 
Amsterdam also ascertained that abuses do not disappear with an administrative approach 
alone. A broader approach is necessary to prevent human trafficking and other abuses.79 
Municipalities have called for a central register (blacklist) of permits refused on the basis 
of BIBOB in order to prevent applicants from simply applying for a permit in a different 
municipality (the waterbed effect).
There is other criticism as well. For instance, an applicant who is refused a permit may only 
inspect the negative recommendation (and may not make copies or notes). No inspection 
of the underlying sources is permitted and the recommendation may not be submitted to 
the municipal complaints committee, which evaluates whether a permit has been rightly re-
fused.80 The BIBOB Act also increases the administrative burden for businesses and admin-
istrative bodies, the possibilities of updating a recommendation from the National Bureau 
BIBOB are limited and all sorts of business collaborations fall outside the scope of the BI-
BOB Act, meaning that no action can be taken against them.81 The Administrative Approach 
to Organised Crime programme confirms that the use of this instrument needs to improve 
and that a number of activities are being deployed in this respect, including an investigation 
into the desirability of expanding the BIBOB Act to other industries and other powers of 
administrative bodies.

A recent survey conducted among all 441 municipalities in the Netherlands by Trouw and Bin-
nenlandsBestuur, the platform for public administration, in cooperation with research agency 
UZ3 indicated that the majority (179) of the municipalities do nothing at all with the BIBOB 
Act. Small municipalities in particular find screening in the context of the BIBOB Act ‘too time 
consuming’, ‘too complicated’ or ‘unnecessary’. The mayor and aldermen of the municipality 
of Appingedam stated in the survey that they decided when the BIBOB Act took effect that the 
municipality would not implement it. 82

270

There are many explanations for the limited application of the law. First of all, municipalities 
see the BIBOB Act as too unwieldy: the municipalities have enough information to evaluate 
a permit application even without the screening. Municipalities also feel they do not have the 
requisite expertise. In addition to recognising suspicious situations, conducting a BIBOB 
screening requires the necessary knowledge and finances. The functioning of the National Bu-
reau BIBOB and obtaining background information on business owners from abroad are other 
difficulties.83

Municipalities do recognise that the law has a preventative effect and that non-uniform appli-
cation should be prevented from having a waterbed effect. Some municipalities indicate that 
business owners disappear after a confrontation with a BIBOB investigation. Other munici-
palities are in fact noticing permit applications from businesses that have been refused a per-
mit in other municipalities.84

In response to the survey, the ministers of Home Affairs and Justice emphasised the importance 
of smaller municipalities also actively applying the law, and cited possible adjustments to the 
law to diminish bottlenecks in implementation. It has already been decided that the RIECs will 
be given an important task in supporting municipalities in implementing the BIBOB Act.85

Certificate of Good Conduct
The Certificate of Good Conduct is a quick, inexpensive and easy instrument that munici-
palities can use to check whether the applicant for a permit has relevant criminal anteced-
ents. The applicant (either a person or a business) receives this certificate if his behaviour 
presents no objection to a permit application. Such a certificate is mandatory for educators 
and taxi drivers, for instance. Municipalities can also decide to make the Certificate of Good 
Conduct mandatory for applications for permits is other sectors, such as operators and 
managers of businesses in the prostitution sector.

Local policy
Besides using the general municipal bye-laws and permits, the local authority can also use a 
policy document to lay down regulations to tackle certain forms of crime. The local author-
ity can also give its own interpretation to certain legal options. The mayor is authorised to 
determine local policy for specific local problem areas. In Amsterdam, policy aimed at the 
prostitution in the red light area is currently being formulated (see §7.6.3). The strategic ac-
quisition of buildings from owners with suspected criminal ties is employed in Amsterdam, 
Maastricht, Venlo and Rotterdam in this context.86

Criminals are innovative, which is why it might be necessary to develop additional instru-
ments. This will be investigated.87 Measures become stronger when are used in combination,

so municipalities therefore have an important task in establishing cooperation and sharing 
information. This is discussed below.

Van Traa team Amsterdam
The Van Traa team concentrates on the administrative approach to organised crime.88 Its 
projects focus on areas (such as the red light district), industries and the development and bet-
ter utilisation of new legal and other instruments (such as the BIBOB Act, amendment of local 
municipal bye-laws and urging the amendment of national regulations). The establishment of 
a strong position with regard to information is important in this. The Van Traa team therefore 
has special access to information from police registers. The Van Traa team and its partners 
have already recorded a number of successes, such as the Doorzon project, which focused on 
the illegal use of homes. Investigation indicated that these homes were also being used for il-
legal prostitution and human trafficking.89

7.4 Administrative approach to human trafficking

This section describes the role of the municipal government in tackling human trafficking. 
Some municipalities, like Amsterdam, have been working on this for some time, so this mu-
nicipality’s approach and plans are further discussed in this section. This does not detract 
from the fact that many other municipalities are working intensively on this at the moment. 
This section first focuses on the so-called programmatic approach and the role of the mu-
nicipal government in this approach.

Programmatic approach – administrative approach
The SneepNRM5 investigation involved an investigation into a human trafficking gang that ex-
ploited prostitutes in the legal prostitution sector (licensed window brothels) on a large scale 
for years and in an extremely violent and organised manner. The Sneep case was chosen as a 
pilot for the programmatic approach in which various partners, including the municipal gov-
ernment, cooperate. The WODC evaluated how the programmatic approach was shaped (see 
§7.6.1 for a description).90 Here, we only discuss the role of the municipal government in this 
approach. After Sneep was chosen as a pilot for the programmatic approach, representatives 
from the public prosecution service approached three municipalities (Amsterdam, Utrecht 
and Alkmaar) where victims had been put to work, seeking their cooperation. During the 
meetings, the municipal government officials were confronted with the extremely violent 
practices of the human traffickers and even shown photos of mistreated victims. This ap-

88 The Van Traa team arose from the Wallen project, which was set up by the municipality of Amsterdam in 
1997 in response to the report Inzake Opsporing of the parliamentary committee of enquiry into methods of 
investigation.

272

proach certainly had an impact. The municipal authorities were shocked and motivated to do 
something about human trafficking. The public prosecution service advised them to cooper-
ate closely and share information. The municipalities looked forward to the administrative 
report, which was still being prepared at the time of the meeting (the administrative report 
Schone Schijn).91 When the report was finished, a presentation was given on the bottlenecks 
that had been revealed to the law enforcement triumvirates (the mayor, the chief constable 
and the chief public prosecutor) of the municipalities involved.92 Local policy advisers also 
attended these meetings. The municipal officials indicated, among other things, that they 
had expected a different type of information than was included in the administrative report. 
They expected factual, concrete information, such as the names of deliberate and inadvertent 
facilitators like window operators, hospitality business operators and apartment landlords, 
that would allow them to take administrative action. Permits could be revoked if it emerged 
they were being used for criminal purposes (BIBOB Act). The report contained more gen-
eral (policy) information, however, about the detection of human trafficking by municipali-
ties and other relevant authorities, for instance. In addition, the municipalities were involved 
at too late a stage in the programmatic approach. For these reasons, the Sneep investigation 
did not result in administrative measures against facilitators or other parties, although this 
case did result in the problem being put on the agenda. The relevant municipalities are now 
working on structural policies to create obstacles to human trafficking. It also became clear 
to the ministries of Justice and Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations that municipalities can 
and must do something to fight human trafficking and it was decided to organise workshops 
for municipalities in order to raise their awareness of the seriousness of the problem and the 
possibilities of combating it. Discussions are still ongoing on how exactly this will be done.93 
An important question here is how this topic can be made a priority and put on the agenda in 
municipalities that are reticent about getting involved.

Amsterdam
The Amsterdam prostitution policy consists of a three-part approach: perpetrator-based, 
victim-based and situational. These are elucidated in different memoranda94 and are ex-
plained below.
The key to the ‘perpetrator-based approach’ is the barrier model, which is intended to dis-
courage potential perpetrators of forced prostitution by creating barriers in seven areas.95 

91 Van Hout & van der Laan (2008).
92 This is a local platform for consultation between representatives of the police, the public prosecution serv-

ice and local government (for example, the mayor, the chief constable of the force or district and the public 
prosecutor).

95 Barriers are created in the areas of 1) labour, 2) spatial and physical planning, 3) economy, 4) finance, 5) hous-
ing, 6) entry/identity, 7) culture/religion.

Administrative enforcement and the integrated approach to human trafficking

273

Instruments are being proposed for this, such as limiting prostitution offerings by reducing 
the number of windows and the zoning of prostitution areas, strengthening the position of 
prostitutes by offering defence courses and a health centre and combating the use of homes 
for criminal activities.96 Other measures proposed to discourage perpetrators include area 
injunctions for pimps in prostitution zones and increasing the minimum age of prostitutes 
to 21. Perpetrators of Dutch background can be frustrated by reducing the financial advan-
tages of human trafficking with the help of the tax authorities and the Department for Work 
and Income. For perpetrators with an Islamic background, informing the community about 
their involvement in prostitution can have a punitive effect.97 For cross-border forced pros-
titution, identity checks of prostitutes can provide the opportunity to identify prostitutes 
working without a residence permit, or working with a false permit, and subject them to fur-
ther investigation. A number of measures require either amendment of existing legislation 
or new legislation. At the time this report was written, there were a number of measures that 
had not proven feasible (see later on in this section).
In addition to creating barriers as discouragement, tackling perpetrators also focuses on 
perpetrator-based prevention, investigation and prosecution. Research indicates for in-
stance that boys in the social environment of a known loverboys are more likely that other 
boys to engage in exploiting women themselves.98 The municipality wants to explore the 
possibilities for prevention.
Victims’ willingness to report incidents is important for investigation and prosecution. That 
is why the policy focuses on informing and educating prostitutes.99 But prosecution without 
a report of a crime by a victim can also be successful. This requires chain partners to be able 
to exchange information.
The ‘victim-based approach’ focuses on strengthening the position of the voluntary prosti-
tute and providing support to victims of forced prostitution. Eight concrete measures have 
been proposed for this.
First, the municipal aid, advice and health centre P&G292 has been given a pivotal func-
tion for prostitutes in Amsterdam. The employees are trained to detect abuses; they find the 
prostitutes and offer them information, courses and healthcare. In an effort to fight human 
trafficking, the Amsterdam Coordination Point for Human Trafficking offers a safe place for 
victims. It addition to accommodation, it focuses on support (legal and psychosocial) and 
providing worthwhile ways for the victims to occupy themselves (language and assimilation 
courses for instance). It also plays an important role in the integrated chain to tackle human 
trafficking, in which efforts are made in conjunction with various organisations to detect and 

96 For which there is cooperation between the police, the municipal housing department, housing associations 
and the urban districts in the form of the ‘Doorzon’ covenant.

97 Some municipalities are exploring the possibilities of a preventive approach to offenders using imams.
98 Terpstra et al. interviewed loverboys, from which it emerged that young men often already knew someone 

who worked as a loverboy before they took the step themselves. Bovenkerk also refers to the inspirational 
effect of a loverboy in a social group. See: Terpstra et al. (2005) and Bovenkerk (2004), both in: Oudberoep, 
nieuwbeleid (2007).

prevent sexual exploitation, to organise and coordinate care for victims and to support the 
investigation and prosecution of suspects (see also §7.6.2).
In order to stimulate independence, prostitutes are informed of the possibilities they have 
under labour law. Another measure involves expanding operating permits to include a social 
chapter, which would impose requirements for working conditions on the operator. Require-
ments for a permit are introduced in phases: every two years the feasibility of additional con-
ditions is evaluated. The first phase, carried out in 2008 and due for evaluation in 2010, con-
tains regulations that provide for a prostitute’s freedom of choice with regard to her work 
clothing, conditions relating to medical assistance, her right to refuse certain customers or 
acts, and control over her own income. An intake interview between the operator and the 
prostitute is also required – to ensure that no human trafficking is involved. Obligations are 
imposed on an operator, prohibiting him from doing business with anyone representing a 
prostitute and requiring him to provide the prostitute with statements and overviews of her 
income and the agreements made.
To facilitate inspection and supervision of the legal prostitution industry, the municipality 
has earmarked funds for four extra municipal supervisors; consequently, all prostitution 
businesses with a fixed location can be inspected eight times a year, rather than the three to 
four inspections that currently take place each year. The municipality is exploring the pos-
sibilities of multidisciplinary inspections in order to inspect the illegal sector. In addition to 
this, the prostitution industry will be regarded as a serious partner and structural discussion 
will take place on how the prostitution sector can become a transparent industry in which 
there is no room for human trafficking.
Some ideas that were proposed in Amsterdam did not prove feasible. For instance, setting 
up an independent management organisation for the direct rental of rooms to prostitutes in 
buildings that are owned or will be owned by municipal partners in the Coalition project 1012 
was investigated. In addition to renting rooms to prostitutes, the organisation would provide 
information on health, safety and working for one’s self. The investigation concluded that 
the government must not play an active role in facilitating such an organisation because of 
the risk to integrity.100

The ‘situational approach’ involves eliminating the opportunities that create a sales market 
for criminal ties and all the abuses these entail. This centres mainly on restructuring meas-
ures that make a particular postal code area more attractive, such as the redevelopment of 
the Beursplein, the Oudekerksplein and the Fortis building and improvements to the public 
space of (among other places) the Damrak-Rokin intersection. The restructuring also aims 

100 At the request of GroenLinks councillors, Amsterdam city council conducted research into the possibility 
of establishing a ‘municipal brothel’: a type of sex establishment where the housing association, as owner of 
a building, and the independent prostitutes form a foundation to organise the intake of the sex workers and 
mange the building. However, partners steadily withdrew from the project in the course of 2008. Because 
of the risks to the municipality’s integrity or companies affiliated to it, in the Strategienota Coalitieproject 
1012 the municipality announced that it would not actively facilitate the project (in terms of financing). In 
July 2008, the housing association Stadgoed NV withdrew, because the risk of exploitation of women could 
not be ruled out, however tight the supervision was.

275

to reduce activities with a low economic value that attract crime, such as ‘coffeeshops’, gam-
ing halls and sex establishments in some specific streets.

7.5  Administrative enforcement in the prostitution sector

The general ban on brothels was lifted in 2000 and municipalities were given the authority to 
regulate the prostitution industry by means of a permit system. This section describes how 
the administrative enforcement is shaped in the prostitution sector (§7.5.1) and how admin-
istrative inspections take place in practice (§7.5.2).

7.5.1 Management and allocation of duties

The municipality is responsible for overseeing prostitution policy. It grants permits and as-
sesses the terms of the permit in advance. The municipalities also have the duty to ensure the 
terms of the permit are adhered to. Most municipalities delegate the duty of monitoring ille-
gality and underage/forced prostitution (human trafficking) to the police, in the assumption 
that what is involved here is serious crime that the police are better equipped to deal with. 
Nevertheless, municipalities are ultimately responsible and also required to supervise this. 
In practice, however, it emerges that municipalities still do not fulfil and manage this duty to 
a great enough extent.NRM5 It was agreed, for instance, in the context of the ‘Handhaven op 
Niveau’NRM5 project that municipalities would make an inventory of the escort agencies oper-
ating within their boundaries and, where possible, compile relevant information.101 The po-
lice perform this task in most municipalities, but only receive financial compensation from a 
few.102 Sometimes the allocation of duties between the municipality and the police is unclear. 
The fact that municipalities themselves may determine their own prostitution policy means 
that different rules apply for the prostitution sector and the allocation of duties.103

A number of changes have taken place in an effort to put an end to this problem. The first is 
the so-called Regulation of Prostitution Act, which ‘forces’ municipalities to, among other 
things, operate more uniformly. This law is discussed in more detail in §2.4.
Second, more municipalities are taking a firmer hold of their management duties. Munici-
palities are increasingly aware that human trafficking can take place in any municipality and 
that it is important to take action against it. Some municipalities have already gone further 
in this respect. In the Rotterdam-Rijnmond region for instance, when the police were able 
to demonstrate that human trafficking was also taking place in smaller municipalities and 
administrators in those municipalities became extremely motivated to tackle the problem. 

101 Also known as the ‘three first steps of HON’.

103 There is in fact now a ‘Guide to Prostitution Policy’, to assist municipalities in developing or improving 

prostitution policy. See: http://www.hetccv.nl/dossiers/Administrative_handhaven/prostitutionbeleid/. The 
CVV also wants to include information about preventive projects and the offender-oriented approach in the 
guide.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

276

More municipalities are also more actively seeking cooperation with chain partners (see 
§7.6.2).
Third, the Human Trafficking Task Force proposed measures for improvements in this area 
in its action plan. It stated that the municipalities had to intensify their management role and 
that there must be a clear allocation of duties between the municipality and the police, and 
proposed a number of measures to achieve this. In the action plan, it cited the intention of 
having a vision document on the allocation of duties between municipalities and the police 
in place by 1 July 2009 as a quick win. The Human Trafficking Task Force’s progress report 
states that an initial version of this vision document has been drafted and contains specific 
recommendations, primarily concerning the integrated inspection teams. Efforts are well un-
derway to produce a protocol/manual for ‘regulation of the licensed prostitution sector’.104

As stated above, in almost all municipalities supervision of the prostitution sector is exer-
cised by the police, but there is a lack of uniformity in this area as well. The powers of super-
vision are allocated differently from one municipality to another and sometimes no pow-
ers are allocated at all.105 The allocation of duties between municipalities and the police is 
therefore unclear and enforcement suffers as a result. This can lead to calculating behaviour 
and shifts in the prostitution sector. The various parties involved assert that agreements on 
the allocation of duties between municipalities and the police should be made by the ‘local 
triumvirate’ (the mayor, the chief constable and the chief public prosecutor). While it was 
hoped that the Regulation of Prostitution Act would provide clearer guidance and be more 
binding in this respect, in the draft version of the law it was decided not to do this, with the 
argument that it is better to tailor the allocation of tasks to local circumstances.106 However, 
the draft legislative proposal stipulates that all sex businesses must have a permit (see §2.4), 
so the problem that some municipalities do and some do not grant permits for certain forms 
of prostitution, such as escort and home prostitution work, will be resolved with the Regula-
tion of Prostitution Act.

Combating illegal prostitution
It is important to combat illegal107 prostitution because the risk of human trafficking sector 
seems to be greatest in this sector. It is primarily the responsibility of the police to tackle il-
legal prostitution, although municipalities, too, can play a role, for example, in the context of 

104 Human Trafficking Task Force (2009b). 
105 Police Force Monitor 2007, p. 72.
106 In its reaction to the draft of the law, the NRM described the absence of certainty about the allocation of 

tasks as a serious gap (see §2.4 and Appendix 6).
107 A distinction is made in the prostitution sector between the legal and the illegal sectors, with the former 

usually referring to the licensed sex establishments and the latter to unlicensed sex establishments that are 
required to have a permit. In fact, the legal sector also encompasses the unlicensed sex establishments that 
are not required to have a permit. They cannot be supervised by administrative means, nor can any action 
be taken against them on the grounds that they are illegal. The fact that municipalities are free not to grant 
permits to certain types of sex establishments has therefore created a grey area, where little supervision is 
possible. The Regulation of Prostitution Act is intended to end that situation, among other thing.

the APV, in the event of nuisance, the use of homes for illegal activities and via the covenant 
on tolerance zones (see §7.6.3). These efforts should take advantage of the information that 
the various municipal services, organisations and professional groups have. Research indi-
cates that they possess “a great deal of useful information”,108 but that the information is 
difficult to find, often because people do not realise that it is relevant. The study calls for 
the establishment of a central repository for this information and for cooperation between 
the parties involved on the basis of a covenant. The police, too, call for a clearer allocation of 
duties with respect to combating illegal prostitution.109 They say there should be a debate at 
national level in order to “put an end to the current fragmented interpretation and perform-
ance of this duty.”
Illegal prostitution is often difficult to ascertain since it can be difficult to prove that sexual 
acts with third parties are occurring in exchange for payment. Those directly involved, such 
as prostitutes, clients and business operators, do not readily make incriminating statements, 
which makes combating these practices very labour intensive. In general, the police mainly 
respond to reports of illegal prostitution (a reactive approach) rather than actively seeking 
it out (a proactive approach). In some municipalities, so-called ‘bait prostitutes’ (police of-
ficers disguised as prostitutes) are deployed to combat illegal street prostitution. A number 
of forces use cyber detectives to monitor the internet for advertisements offering unlicensed 
prostitution. “If you look for advertisements for sex establishments on the internet, before 
you know it you are monitoring the whole world,” said one municipal official.110 It is frequent-
ly asked, therefore, whether such monitoring should take place at municipal or regional level. 
A national approach would be more logical.
It is important for the police that municipalities and other responsible parties (such as the 
fire brigade, tax authorities, Labour Inspectorate) perform their supervisory duties properly 
so that the police can devote more resources to tackling illegal prostitution. This is also im-
portant from the perspective of unfair competition: if the licensed – and bona fide – sector is 
subject to regulation and/or monitoring but illegal operators are allowed to operate relatively 
undisturbed, legitimate operators are at a disadvantage.

7.5.2 Monitoring adherence to permit conditions

The licensed prostitution sector is monitored, usually by the police, for signs of illegality and 
underage/forced prostitution (human trafficking). The norm is that prostitution businesses 
are inspected six times a year by certified111 inspectors. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how 
often business are inspected in practice, but it can be concluded from the Police Force Moni-
tor 2007 that this happens with a certain degree of regularity in most police regions. In some

regions businesses at which abuses have never been ascertained are inspected less frequent-
ly, which leaves more capacity for inspecting suspected mala fide sex businesses.

The fact that it is inspected does not guarantee that the prostitution sector is free from 
abuses, however. That is not the case, as indicated by the Sneep police investigation and the 
administrative report following that investigation.112 Many women were forced to work in 
licensed windows for years in many municipalities, indicating that inspections are not always 
conducted properly. The inspections largely consist of checking the ‘papers’ of prostitutes113 
and only limited time is devoted to these checks. Nor is the code of conduct114 for inspectors 
always adhered to. Inspectors sometimes talk with pimps or have a cup of coffee with busi-
ness operators. This could give victims the impression that the police are in cahoots with 
these individuals. An investigation by ROOD Utrecht quotes victims of human trafficking as 
saying that inspections are sporadic. Loverboys also simply take their girls elsewhere when 
the police show up.115

Inspections are nonetheless an important contact moment between the authorities and po-
tential victims of human trafficking, and it is essential to detect signs of human trafficking at 
these moments, to whatever extent possible. But that is difficult. A prostitute who is under 
pressure to earn a lot of money will give an enthusiastic and cheerful impression in order to 
attract customers. In such cases the victims will in fact seem – paradoxically enough – to be 
‘happy hookers’. Moreover, a victim is unlikely to give the game away during a brief inspec-
tion; after all, there is too great a risk (in her perception).116 There are good reasons why the 
victims of human trafficking seldom file a report. Other factors may play a role as well, such 
as the fact that the victims do not perceive themselves to be victims. This plays a role among 
victims of loverboys but also occurs among victims from certain cultures (see §12.6.1). There 
will always be victims, therefore, who cannot be detected via inspections or will not be will-
ing to cooperate with the police and public prosecution service under any circumstances and 
for whom other avenues and solutions must be sought. But inspections have also prompted 
a number of police investigations and they can have a preventive effect.

A relationship of trust must be created in order to persuade a victim to remove herself from 
the exploitative situation and/or to cooperate with a police investigation.117 However, it is 
legitimate to ask whether the police force is the right authority to create the necessary rela-
tionship of trust. In Denmark, for instance, a cultural anthropologist often accompanies the 

112 Van Hout & van der Laan (2008).
113 For example, they can ask for a passport, a tax and social insurance number or proof of registration with the 

Chamber of Commerce.
114 There are certain risks attached to maintaining contact with the prostitution sector, for example the risk of 

finding oneself in compromising, threatening or otherwise undesirable situations. To minimise this risk, the 
police have drawn up a code of conduct. Police officers who move in prostitution circles in the course of their 
duties must follow the code of conduct.

police to establish the initial contact with possible victims.118 In Rotterdam, police consid-
ered engaging a Bulgarian social worker to approach the many Bulgarian street prostitutes. 
The possibility of using ‘cultural mediators’ or social workers has also arisen on other occa-
sions.119. Although the police undergo intensive training in order to be able to properly con-
duct inspections, the advantage of using support workers is that they have specific skills and 
are not working for the government. On the other hand, these situations involve a criminal 
offence, with all the dangers and requisite professionalism this entails, which is the reason 
the police were chosen for these tasks in the past.
There is the argument that support agencies already active in the field can detect victims and 
inform the police, although this does entail a number of dilemmas (see §8.3.1). Otherwise, 
the police say that working with a permanent prostitution inspection team has the advantage 
that a relationship of trust can be established. In order to avoid disturbing this relationship, it 
is important not to carry out the inspections with partners that intervene in a negative sense. 
For example, inspections with the tax authorities are not permitted.120 In some regions, Rot-
terdam-Rijnmond for example, inspections in the prostitution sector are carried out by both 
the police and the municipality. The municipality (in the case of Rotterdam, the hospitality 
sector team) inspect the documents to ensure that prostitutes are not minors or illegal aliens. 
The police (the human trafficking team) only check for indications of human trafficking and 
are therefore in the best position to invest in establishing a relationship of trust with possible 
victims. They do not have to hold any discussion with the business operator and only talk to 
the prostitutes. The inspectors from the municipality are trained to recognise human traf-
ficking and pass on any signs to the Rotterdam police. There are some bottlenecks, however, 
including the problem that not much time can be spent talking to the prostitutes and many 
prostitutes speak very poor or no Dutch or English, which makes the interviews difficult 
or necessitates the use of an interpreter. Cultural factors can also impede communication, 
along with the means of coercion that human traffickers employ. Repeated contacts – if pos-
sible – would seem necessary therefore.

The question is whether the fact that many victims of human trafficking evidently work in 
the licensed-window prostitution sector also means that many victims are working in other 
licensed prostitution sectors. The presence of staff and other prostitutes at brothels, private 
houses of prostitution, clubs etc. might have a protective effect. There is little known about 
home prostitution, although this form of prostitution lends itself to exploitation. There are 
also only a few known police investigations in which several women were forced to prosti-
tute themselves at a single private address.

Prostitution inspectors often cannot identify the signs that women are working involuntar-
ily in the prostitution industry, so criminal investigation does not occur. In view of this, it is 
important to invest in other approaches as well, such as prevention. ‘Soft’ signs of human 
trafficking such as bruises, tattoos and fearful or insecure behaviour may lead to more in-
terviews with the prostitutes and even talks with possible pimps. This is what happens in 
Eindhoven for instance. If information about possible perpetrators is available when signs 
of human trafficking are detected – and prosecution is not yet possible – the police hold a 
‘deterrent interview’ with these individuals (who are emphatically not regarded as suspects 
at this point). The interview takes place according to a fixed format and is treated as a ‘warn-
ing’. Eight such interviews had been held as of June 2008.121

Using the hotel procedure to monitor escorts
When the ban on brothels was lifted, a means of supervising the escort sector had to been 
found, so the hotel procedure was developed. This procedure involves the police posing as 
a customer, calling an escort and subsequently conducting an inspection.NRM5 While this 
marked a breakthrough in monitoring the escort sector, it does require a lot of capacity. The 
inspection of one escort requires approximately four hours of work by four police person-
nel.122 The hotel procedure has proven to have its shortcomings, however. Escort agencies 
often say now that they are unable to send a girl or do not answer the call. A possible expla-
nation for this could be that the agency recognises the call from the police because of their 
‘careful’ way of placing an order (which is constrained by rules), as well as caller identifica-
tion (if the police call from a land line – most customers use a mobile phone). The hotel 
procedure can also be circumvented by sending an escort who is working legitimately when 
a call from a new customer is received. If the caller proves to be a real client, mala fide agen-
cies will send other girls (underage girls, illegal aliens, human trafficking victims). Escort 
agencies might also pass information on to each other, which does not necessarily mean that 
these escort agencies have underage or illegal girls or victims of human trafficking on their 
books. They are concerned about the costs: the escort has to travel some distance (often with 
a driver) and earns nothing.
Supervising the escort sector is still complex because of the location-independent character 
of the sector. Agency operators and prostitutes can easily move beyond municipal, regional 
and even national borders (the waterbed effect). The use of mobile phones and email ad-
dresses as contact details, thus concealing the people behind these details, makes it even 
harder to get a grip on this sector.123 Some municipalities require escort agencies to have a 
permanent address in order to obtain a permit.

Supervision of home prostitution
Many prostitutes like to work at home, not least because they do not need to hand over any 
income to a sex-business operator. In municipalities where home prostitution does not fall 
within the scope of the permit requirement, such prostitutes are not required to apply for a 
permit and are not inspected. Tackling abuses in home prostitution requires more regula-
tion, and issuing identity cards for home workers is a possibility that is frequently discussed. 
In essence this would subject home prostitution to the permit system, which would at least 
enable inspections.

Agreement on erotic advertisements
Agreements between the Ministry of Justice, the Nederlandse Dagbladpers (the association 
of Dutch newspaper publishers) and content distributor Wegener are aimed at ensuring that 
parties that place erotic advertisements report their permit or VAT number in the advertise-
ment, making it clear to customers that the business is licensed (on the presumption that 
this will reduce the chance that they will be found to hire victims of human trafficking). The 
VER, the Dutch association of brothel owners, has voiced criticism of the effect of the agree-
ment in its monthly magazine, VER Bulletin. In its current form, the agreement does not 
serve as a quality mark for sex businesses, which was the original intention of the Justice 
Ministry.124This is, first, because a permit number need only be reported for advertisements 
in newspapers (and not advertisements online, for instance) and only in some newspapers 
(those published by members of the Nederlandse Dagbladpers or Wegener). In addition, 
prostitutes and sex-business operators who do not have a permit number (since they do not 
fall under the permit requirement) often report Chamber of Commerce numbers, in which 
case it is very easy to use old or non-existent numbers. The VER claims this lack of verifica-
tion of the numbers used renders the agreement pointless.125 There has been a more positive 
response to the insertion of information in erotic listings to raise customer awareness. Such 
texts are indeed placed and the Nederlandse Dagbladpers contacts newspapers that it feels 
are not placing enough of them.
The VER has made two suggestions to improve regulation. On the one hand, the agreement 
should be extended to include multimedia, so that all forms of erotic advertising are subject 
to the same criteria, thus preventing the shift of advertisements from one medium to an-
other to avoid the requirement. On the other, the definitive Regulation of Prostitution Act 
should introduce a uniform system of registration for sex businesses.126

7.6 Integrated approach to human trafficking

Cooperation and the exchange of information are crucial for tackling crime. Various inte-
grated (chain) approaches and projects involve the exchange of information and the joint 
determination of an approach. This section describes the programmatic approach, the chain 
approach and other integrated approaches.

Human Trafficking Task Force’s Action Plan on the exchange of information
The Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan addresses ways of improving information 
exchange at and national level. The progress report on the action plan indicates that a number 
of quick wins have been realised with respect to information exchange. The first version of a 
toolkit for persons involved in the inspection, investigation and prosecution of human traffick-
ing as well as shelter and care for victims has been produced. The toolkit contains information 
on how signs of human trafficking are registered and the conditions for exchanging informa-
tion with other services. The National Police Intelligence Service (IPOL) of the National Po-
lice Services Agency (KLPD) also investigated the bottlenecks in the exchange of information 
between the Expertise Centre on Human Trafficking and People Smuggling (EMM) and the 
regional police forces and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. The results of that investiga-
tion are critical of the current information exchange between these authorities and the EMM’s 
role in this regard. The recommendations from the study relate to improving computerisation, 
better allocation of duties and roles, specific agreements on targets for the quality of the infor-
mation supplied and on feedback to the chain partners, improving the quality of the analysis 
process at EMM and strengthening cooperation with public administration.127 For more infor-
mation about the results of this investigation, see §8.3.

7.6.1 Programmatic approach

The Programme to Strengthen the Approach to Combating Organised Crime has formu-
lated a ‘programmatic approach’ specifically for the topics ‘human trafficking’, ‘organised 
cannabis cultivation’ and ‘abuse of property’.128 This approach, or operational working 
method, is new and in being put into practice in ‘laboratories’ on each of those topics. The 
approach contains a number of elements that, in combination, are supposed to effectively 
combat organised crime. The approach entails the joint use of both administrative partners 
and partners in the criminal law system at local and national level, for both prevention and 
repression. This broad cooperation on different levels is aimed not only at prosecuting per-
petrators and conscious facilitators, but also at gaining an impression of and tackling under-
lying structures that provide opportunities and structural factors that facilitate organised 
crime (whether deliberately or not). The method used is the barrier model, which involves

Documents II 2007/08, 29 911, no. 10), pp. 1, 5-9, 15-18; Kiemel & ten Kate (2007); Van Gestel & Verhoeven 
(2009).

identifying obstacles that can be placed in the way of perpetrators of criminal activities.129 
Financial investigation is also part of the approach. Internationally, efforts have been made 
to cooperate with neighbouring countries, countries where criminal networks operate that 
are also active in the Netherlands and – with regard to human trafficking – victims’ countries 
of origin. In addition to bilateral cooperation, active efforts will also take place at EU level. 
The Human Trafficking Task Force that was appointed in 2008 focuses on strengthening 
supervision in the legal and illegal prostitution sectors, the perpetrator-based approach and 
the barrier model, among other things.130 Information on the progress of the activities of the 
task force in these areas was provided earlier (see §7.3 and §7.5 above).

The programmatic approach was first carried out as a pilot in 2006 in the Sneep investiga-
tion into human trafficking, and was evaluated by the WODC.131 The goal of the Sneep crimi-
nal investigation was to cooperate with other investigative132 and administrative partners to 
gain an optimal view of the group of perpetrators and the way in which people, businesses 
and authorities – deliberately or inadvertently – facilitate human trafficking. During the in-
vestigation, the National Criminal Intelligence Service would prepare administrative reports 
that could provide the basis for administrative measures.
In order to involve the cooperating partners in the Sneep approach, the public prosecution 
service and the police used presentations and the media to provide insight into the mag-
nitude and extremely violent nature of this human trafficking gang, which had freely gone 
about its business for years. This approach worked: after receiving information about Sneep, 
virtually all the partners agreed that this was a major social problem and they were prepared 
to cooperate in combating it. In practice, however, the cooperation of partner organisations 
did not always get off the ground, or not in the manner envisioned, and although municipali-
ties where the human traffickers of Sneep operated were informed and involved – via con-
sultation and the administrative report Schone Schijn (see §8.3.1) – it was at too late a stage. 
Consequently, little knowledge about businesses or authorities that inadvertently play a role 
in human trafficking came to light. This pilot project did not therefore effect administra-
tive action or an exchange of operational information with the municipalities, but it did put 
the human trafficking problem on the agenda at municipalities and it prompted various ef-
forts to tackle human trafficking (including the chain approaches, see §7.6.2; and more pilot 
projects, see below).133 This initial pilot project made it clear that there is a definite need for 

129 The five barriers in the barrier model are entry, housing, identity, work and finance. An integrated approach 
in which all five barriers are tackled is the most effective. The Human Trafficking Task Force’s action plan 
(p. 15)states that the barrier model will be fleshed out for human trafficking. According to the progress re-
port on the action plan, the barrier model is currently being tried out in all human trafficking ‘laboratories’ 
in order to gain experience for fleshing out the model. Source: Human Trafficking Task Force (2009b).

the programmatic approach but implementation needs to improve in order to achieve the 
ambitious results that are envisioned. The WODC’s evaluation offers sufficient points of 
departure to realise this.

Pilot projects
Three official pilot projects in the area of human trafficking in the sex industry were started 
in 2008:134

 – the ‘Ablak’ project, focusing on a group of Hungarian human traffickers operating in a 
number of towns and cities in the Netherlands;

 – the ‘human trafficking from Bulgaria’ project, focusing on human trafficking from that 
country;

 – the ‘greenhouse’ project, focusing on prostitution and human trafficking in the munici-
pality of Utrecht (the Zandpad prostitution zone).

The results of these projects were not yet known when this report was written. Another four 
pilot projects were ready to start, including one concentrating on other forms of exploitation 
(discussed in Chapter 12). The pilot projects are subject to scientific evaluation and supervi-
sion by the WODC.

7.6.2 Chain approach to tackling human trafficking

A growing number of municipalities are using the chain approach, also called the ‘integrated 
approach’ or ‘integrated chain approach’, to tackle human trafficking.135 A chain approach 
involves a combination of a criminal law approach, an administrative approach and support 
and assistance/prevention, although there is no uniform definition and the existing chain 
approaches differ from each other. In some municipalities and regions, the chain approach 
focuses on human trafficking; in others, only on the problems surrounding loverboys (a spe-
cific form of human trafficking). Klein investigated how the chain approach works in five 
police regions136 and what bottlenecks and success factors could be identified.137 BNRM com-
piled additional information on chain approaches in other municipalities and regions.138 This 
section summarises this information.139

134 There have also been several other initiatives in the country involving experiments with the programmatic 
approach. Sources: Written information from public prosecution service, 21 April 2009; Newsletter Opera-
tieOpsporing, volume 2, number 1, February 2009, pp. 1-2. 

135 There is no complete list of all municipalities with such an approach, but they include, in any case, the follow-
ing: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Eindhoven, The Hague and Zwolle.

285

Chain partners
Different partners are active in the current chain approaches. Klein arranges them into the 
following main categories:

 – shelter (shelter institutions);
 – government services (including municipalities, municipal services and the Labour Inspec-

torate);
 – investigation services (including the police, the public prosecution service, the Royal 

Netherlands Marechaussee and the Social Security Information and Investigation Serv-
ice (SIOD));

 – assistance and service provision;
 – health care services (including the municipal health services).

The tax authorities, legal profession, Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers 
(COA), and probation and after-care services can be involved in a chain approach to human 
trafficking. The School Attendance Office and Child Protection Council sometimes also 
play a role in the chain approaches directed at tackling the problem of loverboys. The tasks 
and responsibilities assumed by each organisation in the chain approach to human traffick-
ing varies of course.

Chain approach to human trafficking
There are similarities and differences in the existing chain approaches to human trafficking 
in the Netherlands. The following elements can be found in the various chain approaches to 
human trafficking and loverboys that have been initiated in the Netherlands:

 – a chain coordinator and/or one partner bears responsibility for managing the chain (often 
the municipality).140 Sometimes partners are also appointed to manage the implementa-
tion in a sub-area;141

 – agreements are laid down in covenants and/or protocols;142

 – approaches combine criminal law, administrative law, prevention and the provision of 
aid;

 – the partners hold structural consultations on objectives, policies and changes to the ap-
proach (in a steering committee or working group, for example);

140 The director coordinates the implementation of the approach, monitors progress with the implementation 
and makes agreements with partners on what they will do and on studies to be conducted. 

141 In the areas of prevention, shelter, help and repression, for example.
142 The UN Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking published guiding principles in March 2009 for cov-

enants (Memorandums of Understanding) providing for cooperation between stakeholders and officials re-
sponsible for law enforcement. This document stresses that cooperation is a central element of protection 
against human trafficking and recommends formalising cooperative structures so that joint goals can be 
formulated and potential conflicts can be avoided. The document regards covenants as the most common 
form of formalised cooperation. The document describes the benefits and drawbacks of covenants for dif-
ferent stakeholders in the fight against human trafficking, describes the components that a covenant should 
include and the stakeholders that could be involved. (Planitzer, 2009)

286

 – there is a case review, where cases are discussed among the partners, signs and incidents 
of human trafficking are discussed, information is shared and interventions are coordi-
nated;

 – a centre is established for reporting indications of loverboys or human trafficking;143

 – extra investments are made in relief, shelter and the care for victims;144

 – supervision and enforcement are stepped up;
 – information is exchanged between the partners;145

 – problems are tackled pre-emptively thanks to better detection and supervision;146

 – information for prevention is provided to (possible) victims, (possible) perpetrators and 
their parents, through schools and neighbourhood and community centres, for exam-
ple;

 – a facility is set up for prostitutes to help them improve their position and to detect abus-
es;

 – advice is sought on how to identify and approach victims;
 – agreements are made on communication with the media;
 – lists of indications of human trafficking are used;147

 – specific targets are formulated.148

The case review is an important ingredient in the chain approach.
In regions that do not use a chain approach – in the sense of organised collaboration – there 
is still contact among various chain partners, but usually on an ad-hoc basis in response to 
a specific case or incident. Sometimes there is also consultation with organisations dealing 
with youth prostitution in these cases. That is an area where there has been a tradition of 
chain approaches for some time.

143 For some years, there has been a reporting centre in Zwolle for victims and people close to them. Reports are 
passed on to a working group of aid workers for victims of human trafficking. Fifty percent of all reports that 
were discussed in the working group between 2003 and 2005 came from the reporting centre. Registration 
of reports by such a reporting centre contributes to the available information about victims of loverboys, 
since a reporting centre can not only filter and process reports on the basis of action by the police or social 
workers, but also register all ‘softer’ reports, such as concerns expressed by a teacher and runaway teenagers, 
in combination with debts, new friends and changes in behaviour. CoMensha registers ‘filtered’ reports, but 
there are far fewer than the total number of reports received by social service agencies. 

144 CoMensha has developed a method, based on the chain approach in Amsterdam, to improve the coopera-
tion in the areas of shelter and counselling for victims. This method is described in Van der Aa (2007). 

145 The exchange of information is sometimes constrained by the privacy laws. There should be a balance be-
tween the need to share information in the interests of tackling human trafficking and the individual’s inter-
est in the protection of his or her personal privacy.

146 In Eindhoven, for example, the police conduct interviews with (possible) loverboys (see §7.5.2).
147 On the basis of a list of indicators with a points system, situations that demand cooperation and interven-

tions can be identified. This list of indicators used in Rotterdam makes a distinction between situations call-
ing for special attention and situations demanding intervention.

148 In Rotterdam: 100 victims of sexual exploitation will be removed ‘from the human trafficking chain’ every 
year. Furthermore, every indication of human trafficking will be checked and the police will deliver 30 sus-
pects of human trafficking to the public prosecution service, which will then prosecute them, every year. 
Source: Safety Directorate, Municipality of Rotterdam, 2007, Public Integrity Action Programme, pp. 23-24. 
Figures for 2008 show that these targets were not all met (see later in this section).

Administrative enforcement and the integrated approach to human trafficking

287

In regions that do not adopt a chain approach (sometimes despite the desire for such an ap-
proach), the bottleneck tends to be that the partners do not perceive human trafficking to 
be a problem and are therefore not willing to invest in a joint approach. Incidentally this 
bottleneck also occurs in regions where a chain approach is in place. Not all the partners – 
even if they participate – see human trafficking as a problem in their region or they are not 
aware of the role that their own organisation can play in tackling it. Klein explicitly cites mu-
nicipalities and the VNG as examples. Other bottlenecks that Klein identified are the failure 
to recognise indications of human trafficking, problems faced by organisations in terms of 
capacity, poor accessibility to assistance and the shortage of places in shelters for victims of 
human trafficking. A care coordinator for human trafficking149 is sorely needed in a number 
of regions.

It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the chain approaches, and some have been start-
ed too recently to be able to do so. A few results from the chain approach in Rotterdam are 
given below for the sake of illustration.

Results of the chain approach in Rotterdam150

In 2008 an information-exchange system was developed between parties in care (municipal 
health services, prostitution social work) and repression (police and the public prosecution 
service) in order to facilitate the smooth running of case reviews, “thus making the chain ap-
proach a comprehensive one. A new covenant was also drawn up for the exchange of informa-
tion. In May 2008, the regionalisation of the Rotterdam approach to human trafficking was 
started. In 2008, 246 indications of human trafficking were checked and dealt with;151 139 new 
potential victims of human trafficking were traced; prostitution social work counselled 50 new 
potential victims of human trafficking; eight criminal investigations into human trafficking 
were launched, in which 45 individuals were designated as suspects (13 were suspected of hu-
man trafficking, 21 of sexual abuse of an underage victim and the remaining 11 of trading in nar-
cotics and fraud). It was concluded from this that broader criminal networks are often involved 
in human trafficking. Of the 26 suspects of human trafficking that the public prosecution serv-
ice registered in 2008, four had been taken to court and sentenced to custodial sentences by the 
time the annual report was written.

7.6.3 Other integrated approaches

A number of other integrated approaches currently pursued in the Netherlands are described 
below.

149 Several years ago networks for victims of human trafficking were set up in various regions, in which agencies 
that provide help and services for the victims cooperate in providing shelter and counselling for victims of 
human trafficking These networks are coordinated by a so-called care coordinator for human trafficking.

Project Emergo
Amsterdam has started the project Emergo, a pilot project of the ministries of Home Affairs 
and Kingdom Relations, Justice and Finance, the municipality of Amsterdam, the public 
prosecution service, the police and the tax authorities, which has the aim of tackling concen-
trations of criminal power and ad hoc structures in the 1012 postal code area (the red light 
district).152 A legal framework for information exchange has been developed and teams are 
working to analyse relevant information. The analyses are intended to culminate in coordi-
nated actions by the relevant enforcement agencies. Human trafficking is one of the focal 
areas of the project. A final report from the project will be published in 2011.153

Safety houses
Safety houses (veiligheidshuizen) are locations where organisations such as the police, the 
public prosecution service, the Child Protection Board, the municipality and youth care in-
stitutions work together to tackle youth crime and recidivism. Some safety houses, such as 
those in Rotterdam and Eindhoven, also address human trafficking. This cooperation pro-
duces a wealth of information on youth and their environment, which enables the partners to 
quickly construct a personalised approach. There are currently more than 25 safety houses 
in the Netherlands and new ones are being added all the time. In the course of 2009, there 
should be a network of 40 safety houses throughout the country.

Tolerance zones
So-called ‘tolerance zones’ (vrijplaatsen) are areas where the government does not adequately 
enforce regulations and laws.154 These zones may concern a specific theme or a specific area, 
for example, trailer parks, illegal casinos, callshops, ‘coffeeshops’ and the prostitution sec-
tor. The existence of tolerance zones is no longer considered acceptable and municipalities 
are taking more action against them. Since enforcement in tolerance zones often embraces a 
number of different policy areas, this problem is also being tackled in an integrated fashion 
(under the municipality’s direction). In these cases, a so-called ‘covenant on tolerance zones’ 
is concluded to detail the allocation of duties and the exchange of information.

7.7 Conclusions

This section indicates the problems in the topics discussed in this chapter and what topics 
demand particular attention.

ment fails to act against or respond adequately to threats.

Administrative enforcement and the integrated approach to human trafficking

289

A number of positive changes have been set in motion. In the context of the measures pro-
posed by the Human Trafficking Task Force aimed at strengthening supervision in the pros-
titution sector, a protocol/manual for ‘supervision in the licensed prostitution sector’ is be-
ing drafted in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations and 
municipalities.

Prostitution sector
Three sectors have arisen since the legalisation of prostitution: the illegal, the legal licensed 
and the legal unlicensed. The idea that has been put forward of curtailing the licensed sector 
is in itself, in other words without additional measures, an ineffective way of preventing hu-
man trafficking and abuses, since it could cause a shift to illegal forms of prostitution, which 
are more difficult to monitor and regulate through policy.
Prostitution, legal and illegal, takes many forms and developments in the sector follow in 
rapid succession. To deal effectively with the effects of this in the form of human trafficking, 
an integrated approach incorporating administrative measures as well as criminal sanctions 
is required. One aspect that shows the need for this is the fact that in many places exploita-
tion in (illegal) prostitution is sometimes unconsciously facilitated, for example by hotels. 
New measures could be taken to address this, although experience shows that when one 
form of prostitution is cracked down on the activities almost immediately shift to other seg-
ments of the prostitution sector.
It is generally accepted that one of the aims of the policy should be to provide prostitutes with 
greater possibilities to control their own lives so that they are less likely to become victims 
of human trafficking. However, it has to be noted in that context that this scarcely follows in 
those cases where human traffickers use severe means of coercion.
A point that needs to be considered for any approach that is taken is that many prostitutes 
do not speak Dutch.

Prostitution policy and administrative enforcement
The aforementioned effect that dealing with forms of exploitation in prostitution quickly 
leads to the relocation of illegal activities is reinforced by the fact that municipalities are al-
lowed to formulate their own policy on prostitution. Consequently, there is no uniform poli-
cy towards the prostitution sector. For example, certain forms of prostitution are licensed in 
one municipality but not in another. Many municipalities also fail to properly formulate and 
manage the prostitution policy and its administrative enforcement. This is not helped by the 
hands-off approach of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG). Smaller local 
authorities in particular are sometimes reluctant to tackle human trafficking, either because 
they do not realise the urgency of the problem or because they do not feel they have sufficient 
powers.
The municipalities are responsible for pursuing an adequate prostitution policy. The police 
play an important role in this with respect to the supervision and prevention of illegal pros-
titution. In this respect, the division of tasks between the local authority and the police is 

NMR Ch07.indd   289 09-06-10   00:07



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

290

unclear in many municipalities. The powers to exercise supervision can differ from one local 
authority to another, and in some cases no powers have been delegated at all. This encour-
ages human traffickers to be calculating.
Other agencies also have a role in supervision. Besides the municipalities themselves, these 
can include the fire brigade, the tax authorities and the Labour Inspectorate. There are some 
signs that not all of them perform their supervisory duties in the prostitution sector prop-
erly. These additional ‘eyes and ears’ are sorely missed, which is regrettable in a sector that 
is very sensitive to human trafficking, which can only be dealt with effectively by reading the 
signs. Illegal prostitution is often difficult to identify simply because it is difficult to prove 
that sexual acts are being performed with third parties for payment.
(Administrative) control is particularly difficult in the case of forms of prostitution that oc-
cur outside clubs, such as escort services and prostitution offered on the Internet. The effec-
tiveness of the labour-intensive ‘hotel procedure’ seems to have declined in efforts to control 
escort services, perhaps because the method has become too well known. The question is 
whether it is possible to control the escort services industry at all. The control of licensed 
prostitution businesses does not in fact guarantee that human trafficking can be eradicated 
from it. Nor are the administrative controls in the prostitution sector always carried out 
properly. Superficial inspections of a prostitute’s papers, for example, will not expose ex-
ploitation. That requires interviews in a safe setting.
The Convenant on Erotic Advertisements, under which those who place advertisements for 
erotic services give their licence or VAT number in the advertisement, has scarcely any effect 
in curbing exploitation since its scope is too narrow (it only covers some printed media) and 
because the numbers are not checked.

Administrative approach to organised crime and human trafficking
The instrument of the administrative report, in other words the written notification from 
the police to the executive of a municipality that in the course of their duties they have dis-
covered facts and circumstances relevant for the municipality’s enforcement of human traf-
ficking policy, does not work properly. The police do not seem to have sufficient capacity to 
write good reports. The reports usually contain no information on which the municipalities 
can base specific action. For their part, municipalities also sometimes fail to pass on useful 
information to the police.

Integrated approach
The programmatic approach, which involves systematic cooperation with chain partners is 
useful and necessary, but during a number of projects known as ‘laboratories’, it emerged that 
its implementation needs to improve. In practice, the partner organisations do not cooperate 
or at least not in the envisaged manner. Organisations are often unclear about what precisely 
is required of them or what they are expected to do is not one of its priorities. Consequently, 
scarcely any information has emerged about companies or agencies that unconsciously play 
a role in human trafficking. The integrated approach to human trafficking is not universally

followed, partly because the partners concerned do not perceive human trafficking to be 
a problem and are therefore not willing to invest in a joint approach. Even where the inte-
grated approach is adopted, partners are sometimes cautious. There is in fact no overview 
of how widely the integrated approach is followed; it is not known how many municipalities 
have adopted a chain approach to human trafficking, what similarities and differences there 
are between them are and how effective they are.
A care coordinator for human trafficking is badly missed in various police regions.

Investigation

8.1 Introduction

There are some specific features of human trafficking that can make it a difficult offence 
to investigate. For example, it is difficult to get victims to come forward and, if they do, to 
secure their cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers. There 
are also various manifestations of human trafficking (sexual exploitation, non-sexual ex-
ploitation, the loverboy problem), each of which has to be investigated, at least partially, 
with a different approach. Transnational human trafficking requires international coopera-
tion, which is often time-consuming, and the legislation is complex. In short, investigat-
ing human trafficking is not always straightforward, but it is, nevertheless, essential. This 
chapter describes how human trafficking is investigated in the Netherlands. Relevant na-
tional policy developments are discussed in §8.2 and the process of identifying the offence 
is described in §8.3. Section 8.3.3 describes how information is processed; how the police 
deal with indications of human trafficking. The actual investigation of human trafficking is 
discussed in §8.4. Specific problems surrounding the phenomenon of ‘shelved cases’ are 
reviewed in §8.5. The chapter ends with an assessment of international developments in the 
field of investigation (§8.6).

8.2  National policy developments and initiatives

Safety Begins with Prevention is a project that started in 2007.1 It concentrates on tackling 
crime (including organised crime) in six areas, including human trafficking.2 Built on an in-
tegrated approach, the project adopts a combination of prevention, enforcement through 
administrative and criminal law, and after-care. This means that there is a role in the process 
not only for the public prosecution service and the police, but also for administrative author-
ities and civil organisations, such as housing associations, labour market organisations and 
educational and care institutions. The government also wants to actively involve members 
of the public, particularly in preventing crime, public nuisance and degeneration.3 A special 
programme has been developed to tackle organised crime (see below).

1 The aim is to reduce crime and nuisance by 25% compared with 2002 by the end of this government’s term in 
office. The project builds on the results of the Safety Programme (2002-2007).

2 The six themes are (1) tackling aggression and violence, (2) tackling theft, (3) tackling crime against busi-
nesses, (4) tackling anti-social behaviour and local degeneration, (5) an individualised strategy for youths 
at risk and repeat offenders, and (6) tackling serious and less visible forms of crime, such as cyber-crime, 
financial and economic crime and organised crime.

Programme to Strengthen the Approach to Combating Organised Crime
This aim of this programme is to intensify efforts to fight organised crime in the Nether-
lands by strengthening enforcement under criminal and administrative law4 in combination 
with an international approach to organised crime. The programme addresses the following 
specific themes:
 – human trafficking;
 – organised cannabis growing;
 – real estate;
 – the Emergo project (targeted at the red light district in Amsterdam).5

The ‘National priorities for the police for 2008-2011’ (which were adopted by the Ministers 
of the Interior and Justice in consultation with the police) state that the police will play their 
part in this programme.6

Reference Framework for Human Trafficking (2008)
To improve and harmonise the approach to human trafficking by the police, the National Ex-
pert Group on Human Trafficking (LEM)NRM5 drafted the Reference Framework for Human 
Trafficking (2008), which sets out a framework for how the Dutch police should organise 
their efforts to tackle human trafficking. Among other things, it calls for a regional chain ap-
proach that allows human trafficking to be addressed proactively, as well as through preven-
tion and repression. The reference model includes the following standards for investigation 
and enforcement:
 – Every force must deploy sufficient capacity to carry out investigations into human traffick-

ing, to reflect the high priority assigned to the offence.7

 – Every force must formulate an approach to human trafficking.8

 – Teams investigating human trafficking should, in principle, be multidisciplinary.9

4 See also Chapter 7.
5 See also Chapter 7.
6 The amended Police Act (2007) provides that the Ministers of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and Justice 

will formulate the main points of policy concerning the performance of police tasks at least once every four 
years. The main points of this policy, or national priorities, replace the former National Framework for the 
Dutch Police. The priorities set out in the Joint national priorities for the police 2008-2011 cover the themes of vio-
lence, safe neighbourhoods, youth crime and youths at risk and the quantity and quality of investigations. The 
national objectives at regional level are monitored every year. The monitoring process includes annual meet-
ings to discuss progress between representatives of the forces and officials of the ministries of the Interior and 
Kingdom Relations and Justice. A force that meets the targets qualifies for performance-related financing.

7 The Investigations Board agreed at a meeting in January 2009 that performance would be assessed on the 
basis of results achieved rather than setting a standard for the deployment of capacity. The standard adopted 
was that the police forces would report the number of investigations planned and carried out to the LEM. The 
question is, however, whether this is the most appropriate measure. Forces are not in fact allowed to ‘shelve’ 
any human trafficking cases and the number of shelved cases would be a better measure (see also §8.5).

8 In any case, including Intelligence Led Policing (see §8.3.3) and supervision and investigation in the licensed 
and non-licensed prostitution sector (see Chapter 7).

 – No policy relating to the volume of cases should be applied in the area of human traffick-
ing.10

 – Financial investigations should be conducted in every investigation of human traffick-
ing.11

 – The emphasis during administrative checks should be on detecting illegal prostitution (in-
cluding underage prostitutes) and victims of human trafficking.12

 – All relevant police officers should be informed about the characteristics, indications and 
manifestations of illegal prostitution and human trafficking (including its victims).

 – Specific information needs to be collected about human trafficking so that it can, if neces-
sary, be prosecuted even without reporting human trafficking. Every police region should 
therefore be organised in such a way that there is a central location where every indication 
of human trafficking is collected, analysed, upgraded and collated.

 – The police force should constantly consult and analyse information from public sources.13

 – When a suspect emerges, facts and circumstances should be accumulated.NRM5 Facts and 
circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of guilt of human trafficking should be 
included in a ‘table 27 construction’.14

 – To tackle human trafficking effectively, it is important that the various organisations share 
information.15 Agreements must be concluded to this effect.

 – Police forces should take the initiative to establish a chain approach to human trafficking 
in their region.

 – Police forces should actively pursue international cooperation.
 – The police force should produce a roadmap for dealing with indications and/or victims of 

human trafficking and police officers who are likely to come in contact with victims of hu-
man trafficking in the performance of their duties should be acquainted with it.

 – The police force should appoint a ‘B9’ contact person to guarantee the proper and effective 
implementation of the B9 regulation.16

 – The regional force should take specific action to implement any improvements identified 
in the Police Force Monitors.

10 In other words, a maximum number of human trafficking investigations to be conducted is specified.

The Reference Framework for Human Trafficking contains very clear guidelines on how the 
police can intensify efforts to tackle human trafficking. However, it is unclear how the police 
can be obliged to follow them. The Police Force Monitor on Human Trafficking (further 
referred to as the Police Force Monitor) (see below) may devote attention to this.

Police Force Monitor
Ever since the abolition of the ban on brothels, the police have monitored the efforts and per-
formances of individual forces in the area of prostitution and human trafficking.17 Following 
an interval, the most recent Police Force Monitor on Prostitution and Human Trafficking 
was published in 2007.18 The results in the Police Force Monitor were national news even be-
fore they were published, partly because of the high number of ‘shelved cases’ (human traf-
ficking cases that were not dealt with) reported in it (see §8.5 on the NRM study into shelved 
cases). It also emerged that many police forces were underperforming. This prompted many 
forces to make improvements, including the formation of ‘human trafficking teams’.19 Spe-
cific results are discussed in this and other chapters, where relevant. One of the standards 
laid down in the Reference Framework for Human Trafficking is that a Police Force Monitor 
should be produced every two years, under the auspices of the national coordinator for hu-
man trafficking. The next Police Force Monitor will be published in 2009.20

Flexible Intelligence and Expertise Team (FIET)
The National Criminal Intelligence Service is planning to establish a Flexible Intelligence 
and Expertise Team (FIET) for human trafficking and migrant smuggling. The team will 
gather and analyse so-called ‘level 3(+)’ information about international organised human 
trafficking, in association with the EMM, among others. The EMM will remain the central 
collection point for receiving and processing indications of human trafficking and distribut-
ing information derived from these data, and will pass on level 3(+) information it receives to 
the FIET. The EMM will also receive information from the FIET (reports of human traffick-
ing and so-called residual and incidental information). The ultimate aim is that the National 
Criminal Intelligence Service will be able to use the information from the FIET to tackle 
human trafficking and migrant smuggling effectively and efficiently. It is also the task of the 
FIET to devise innovative strategies for tackling human trafficking. A relevant aspect in that 
context is a recommendation made in a study carried out for the Human Trafficking Task 
Force that the Netherlands Police Agency (KLPD) should make clear, binding agreements 

17 In other words, the supervision of the licensed prostitution sector and efforts to tackle illegal prostitution 
and human trafficking.

18 Further referred to as the ‘Police Force Monitor 2007’.
19 Other names are sometimes used. The tasks of these teams also vary (see §8.5); they are sometimes also 

concerned with crimes other than human trafficking, such as child pornography and migrant smuggling.

on the number of level 3 and 4 investigations by the FIET. The stakeholders in the EMM 
should also be consulted. 21

National Expert Group on Human Trafficking
The National Expert Group on Human Trafficking (LEM) is a consultative body in which 
police forces share information about strategies and policies.NRM5 Since 2007, meetings of 
the LEM have only been attended by experts from selected forces (rather than from all of 
them) and, alternately, with or without external partners. The experts who do attend main-
tain contact with the other forces through working groups. Once a year there is a two-day 
meeting that is attended by the experts from all the forces. When all the forces were directly 
represented in it, one of the LEM’s functions was to spur on and motivate forces that were 
lagging behind in the priority they gave to addressing human trafficking. The new, decentral-
ised structure of the meetings seems to be at the expense of this function.

National Threat Assessment 2008
The second National Threat Assessment (NTA) appeared in October 2008.22 It provided an 
analysis of organised crime in the Netherlands highlighting existing and future threats to 
Dutch society. The NTA also addressed human trafficking, specifically the scale of the prob-
lem (the rise in the number of serious indications),23 the criminal organisations involved24 
and crime-related factors.25 It also referred to the fact that stricter measures against Roma in 
Belgium could possibly lead to more exploitation of Roma children in the Netherlands (more 
information about Roma and human trafficking can be found in §4.2.5).
Given the serious consequences of sexual exploitation for the personal lives of the victims 
and the fact that the scale of the problem is unlikely to decline under the current circum-
stances, the NTA described human trafficking as a threat to Dutch society. Exploitation in 
other economic sectors is described as a ‘blank spot’ in the threat assessment; in other words, 
it is a phenomenon about which there is too little information to give a clear qualification. 
Both the scale of the phenomenon and the consequences for society are difficult to estimate, 
according to the National Threat Assessment.26

21 De Kamps (2009); KLPD’s Police Intelligence Service (IPOL); Human Trafficking Task Force (2009b).
22 The first National Threat Assessment appeared in 2004.
23 In 2005, police forces received more than 700 serious indications of human trafficking (in relation to prostitu-

tion). In the first three quarters of 2006, there were more than 1,100 indications. However, the number and type 
of indications cannot be interpreted uniformly and consistently and, consequently, are never included in the 
BNRM reports (see NRM5). One of the explanations given in the NTA for the increased number of indications 
is the greater awareness of human trafficking among citizens and the police. As regards cases of other forms 
of exploitation, the NTA says that investigating officers still know little about the scale of the problem. The 
National Threat Assessment then refers to research and figures published in the fifth report of the NRM.

24 Twenty-three investigations of human trafficking (18 cases of exploitation in prostitution and five cases of ex-
ploitation in other sectors) show that the ethnic make-up of suspects is homogenous. Other offences that fre-
quently occur in the course of human trafficking are drug dealing, assault and battery, rape and intimidation.

25 The NTA regards government policy and its regulation as the most decisive crime-related factors. In the case 
of human trafficking, the abolition of the ban on brothels is mentioned.

Police system
The plans for a ‘national police force’ are not going ahead.NRM5 In December 2008, the gov-
ernment sent a new bill to parliament under which the decentralised police system would 
remain intact but the government would tighten its oversight. The bill provides that police 
forces must coordinate more of their affairs, such as procurement of materials and person-
nel policy.27 Even these plans were criticised by the police and the Association of Netherlands 
Municipalities (VNG).28 The chief constables want to strengthen the unity of the police or-
ganisation at national level within the contours of the current system and with retention of 
decentralised management. At the time this report was written, the bill still had to be passed 
by both houses of parliament.

8.3	 Identifying	situations	of	human	trafficking

8.3.1	 Identifying	human	trafficking

Various indications can point to human trafficking. Briefly, these can be dependency (on the 
employer), severe restriction of the basic freedoms of the individuals concerned, working un-
der very poor conditions and violation of physical integrity.29 Employees of organisations that 
might be confronted with victims of human trafficking should ideally be aware of these signs 
and know where they should take such information. The Human Trafficking Task Force’s ac-
tion plan includes a measure designed to promote this. Meanwhile, some progress has already 
been made in increasing awareness of indications of human trafficking throughout the chain.30 
This section discusses the identification of human trafficking by the police and other agen-
cies (social services, members of the public, clients of prostitutes, operators of sex establish-
ments, the IND, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, the tax authorities, municipalities and 

27 The police forces also made agreements on this in 2005, which led to the establishment of the Facility for 
Police Cooperation (VtSPN). The new bill will advance the cooperation a stage further.

29 For a complete list, see the Instruction on Human Trafficking.
30 For example, in February 2009 the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment published a fact sheet for 

victims, in association with CoMensha and BLinN, entitled ‘Exploitation at the workplace’ in 12 languages. 
In association with the ministries of Education, Culture and Science and Health, Welfare and Sport, the 
ministry also includes information for prostitutes and social workers about indications of human trafficking 
in the prostitution sector, organisations that provide help and the rights of victims in publicity materials. In 
December 2008, the Labour Inspectorate trained 24 new inspectors in how to identify signs of work-related 
exploitation and in the summer of 2009, the SIOD started an internal programme to strengthen efforts to 
combat human trafficking. In addition, an instructional film was produced (by the ministries of Justice, So-
cial Affairs and Employment and the Interior and Kingdom Relations) for the police, the Royal Netherlands 
Marechaussee, the Labour Inspectorate and the SIOD to make them more alert to human trafficking. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment and the Ministry of Justice both provided subsidies to BLinN for 
the project ‘Identifying and informing hard-to-reach victims’, the aim of which is to increase the expertise 
of relevant actors and their access to victims. A standard list of indicators is also being drawn up for officers 
of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee who work on the border and in the mobile immigration supervision 
teams. See Human Trafficking Task Force (2009b).

chambers of commerce). The importance of their identifying the offence lies in the fact that, 
for various reasons, victims cannot or will not go to the police.

Police
Information about human trafficking reaches the police in various ways, for example as a 
result of the supervision of the prostitution sector, through often anonymous reports or be-
cause the police discover indications of human trafficking themselves.31 Among those who 
could report human trafficking to the police are the parents or friends of victims or other 
prostitutes, operators of sex establishments, neighbours or clients who suspect abuses, but 
also sources of an entirely different nature, such as abortion doctors (see box).

Abortion doctors
In the Sneep investigation,NRM5 human traffickers forced their victims to have abortions. As a 
result of these practices, the BNRM arranged a meeting between the Dutch Society of Abor-
tion Doctors and the Dutch police’s Expertise Centre on Human Trafficking and Migrant 
Smuggling to discuss indications that could suggest human trafficking. During the intake 
interview, in particular, when the doctor determines whether the woman wants an abortion, 
there are opportunities for a risk analysis of human trafficking. The plan is therefore to draw up 
a protocol setting out how abortion doctors can recognise human trafficking and what action 
they should take if they suspect coercion. Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin has also said in par-
liament that medical operations undergone under coercion can be addressed through criminal 
law and medical disciplinary procedures.32

Police officers can encounter human trafficking during regular inspections (outside risk sec-
tors, such as the prostitution sector). For example, during a traffic check, a police officer 
stopped a car with a Bulgarian driver carrying three Bulgarian women as passengers. The 
driver had the women’s passports in his pocket and the women appeared extremely scared. 
A situation like this can suggest human trafficking. To be able to recognise this it is impor-
tant for police officers to be informed about indications of human trafficking. In some police 
regions they are, but not in all.

Fact sheet on indications of human trafficking/migrant smuggling for the police
All police officers recently received a convenient fact sheet with a list of indicators of migrant 
smuggling or human trafficking that they should look out for during routine checks. The list 
includes characteristics of human traffickers and smugglers, as well as of victims.33 The fact 
sheet instructs officers who encounter any of the indicators to contact the regional department 
of the aliens police.

31 For example, through indications of illegal (unlicensed) prostitution involving victims of human trafficking.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

300

The Police Force Monitor 2007 and the Reference Framework for Human Trafficking both 
call for information to be provided to all police officers working on the street. It is also im-
portant that police officers make a record of this information, which could ultimately provide 
a missing piece in a puzzle or together, which together with others, expose an offence. This is 
particularly important in the case of offences like human trafficking, where the willingness 
to make a report is low.34

The records should preferably use the term ‘human trafficking’ explicitly, so that the infor-
mation can be easily traced. But information can also be collected in other ways (see box).

Recognising (potential) victims of exploitation in prostitution
The analysis department of the Hollands Midden police force has developed an extensive 
search formula with which it can detect (potential) victims of certain forms of human traffick-
ing in police registration systems. It has two aims: first, it makes it easier to determine whether 
vague reports do actually concern exploitation in prostitution; second, it helps in prevention. 
By recognising potential victims in time they can be helped before they end up in prostitution. 
On the basis of literature and police information, a set of characteristics of Dutch victims of 
forced prostitution was collected. The indicators include the use of illegal substances, debts, 
antecedents, mental retardation, sexually excessive behaviour, domestic violence, running 
away, removal from home, contact with the social services, cultural background of boyfriend, 
use of free time, etc. The lists contains a wide range of characteristics categorised in the do-
mains ‘individual’, ‘family’, ‘contemporaries and free time situation’ and ‘school and work’. 
For the purposes of searching, the indicators are formulated as much as possible in ordinary 
speech (as an officer would enter it in the BPS/BVH). With the help of this indicator analysis,35 
the police in Hollands Midden have found more victims and potential victims of exploitation 
in prostitution. But the model has far more uses. When community police officers, youth coor-
dinators and juvenile and vice detectives know these indicators, they are better able to identify 
and monitor potential victims, record relevant information and, where possible, take preven-
tive action. The Youth Prevention Team36 (JPT) and the aliens police (the department that deals 
with human trafficking) cooperate and share information. For example, they consult on what 
the social services and the investigators can do for an underage girl who might be a victim of 
exploitation. Analysts from the Hollands Midden police can, if necessary, also make a so-called 
‘exploitation analysis’ in the event of an indication of human trafficking. The document con-
tains a summary of all the information available to the police about suspects and/or victims and 
an estimate of the chance that it is a human trafficking situation. This estimate is made on the 
basis of a model in which scores are assigned to indicators closely related to human trafficking, 
such as contacts in the sex industry, negative aspects in a person’s life history, etc. On the basis 
of this exploitation analysis, tactical choices can be made before starting an investigation.

34 Sources include Blauw Opsporing, volume 4, number 4; Recherche Vakbeurs, 13 June 2008.
35 The program Brains (Basic Investigation and Analysis Instrument) is used for the analysis.
36 There is a Youth Prevention Team (YPT) for each district in the Hollands Midden region, which is a partner-

ship between the police and the Youth Care Agency. It offers preventive help to young people up to the age 
of 18 who have been in trouble with the police. These are not only young people who commit offences, but 
also young people who display warning signs, such as truancy or running away from home.

The Criminal Intelligence Unit (Criminele Inlichtingeneenheid – CIE)37 also plays a role in 
identifying human trafficking.NRM5 Although the CIE’s methods in this area are not known, 
the CIE’s attention to human trafficking does seem to be increasing. Various forces have pro-
vided information or training for the CIE. Some forces have said they have received many 
indications of human trafficking from the CIE. The CIE is informed of potential sources by 
police officers who are involved in supervising prostitution, for example. There is currently 
a discussion underway about the possibility of recruiting informants in the legitimate world 
to learn more about the involvement of legitimate business in organised crime.38 However, 
the complexity of human trafficking investigations also has consequences for CIE inform-
ants. The CIE often operates on the ‘no cure, no pay’ principle, so if a tip does not lead to an 
arrest or a case – which can happen when victims of human trafficking do not cooperate with 
the investigation – no reward is paid.39

The identification of other forms of exploitation is primarily the responsibility of the aliens 
police, mainly because of their involvement in inspections of companies to search for illegal 
aliens, for example in sectors where there is a risk of human trafficking, such as the hospital-
ity industry and agriculture and horticulture. The aliens police are increasingly aware of the 
possibility that there may be victims of human trafficking among illegal immigrants. This 
is apparent, for example, from the Agreement on the Performance of Police Aliens Tasks 
2009-2011 [Convenant Uitvoering Politiele Vreemdelingentaak 2009-2011], in which identify-
ing human trafficking and providing help for victims of human trafficking was made a policy 
priority. A new course on migration-related crime is also being developed for the aliens po-
lice. One of the aims of the course is to help officers to identify victims of other forms of 
exploitation and to respond adequately.40 The survey of shelved cases and the Police Force 
Monitor, among other things, also show that there is room for improvement in the recogni-
tion of other forms of exploitation and many police forces are still searching for the right ap-
proach to this form of human trafficking. This is one reason why some situations of exploi-
tation are probably unknown. The detection of exploitation outside the sex industry must 
be improved and intensified to reduce the scale of human trafficking in the Netherlands. To 
achieve this, illegal aliens who are arrested and who might be victims of human trafficking 
could be questioned about it, for example. This does not always happen, although this is 
partly due to practical circumstances.41 In practice, it is also unclear when – in the case of 
illegal workers – there is the ‘slightest indication’ of human trafficking and they should be 

37 The CIE’s task is to collect, register and analyse information about criminal offences and suspects. It is the 
only police division that is allowed to use informants who provide information anonymously. Information 
from the CIE therefore cannot be used as evidence in a trial, but it can help to create a suspicion on the 
grounds of which an investigation can begin.

an interview or to create a relationship of trust so that a victim is willing to tell more.

offered the period of reflection (see also Chapter 12). The identification of other forms of 
exploitation by special investigation services and inspectorates is discussed in §12.2.

Help
For various reasons, victims of human trafficking are not always prepared to cooperate 
with the investigation and prosecution of offenders.NRM5 Furthermore, foreign victims, in 
particular, do not always know how to approach the police. For these and other reasons, 
social services maybe aware of more or different victims than the police and the public pros-
ecution service. Social-service agencies can also report suspicions of human trafficking to 
the police. The Amsterdam Human Trafficking Coordination Point (ACM), for example, 
published a brochure for chain partners explaining how to identify human trafficking and 
where to report it. In principle, a case is reported to the ACM, which then notifies the police. 
The brochure also mentions the possibility of reporting information to the CIE. Neverthe-
less, the social services face a dilemma in passing on information. The question is whether 
reporting human trafficking or the investigation of a human trafficking case is always in the 
best interests of the client, in terms of their protection, for example. Social workers also feel 
they have a duty of confidentiality towards their clients to a certain extent. The Programme 
to Strengthen the Approach to Combating Organised Crime in fact states that a study will 
be carried out to explore how information from social workers can be used for the investiga-
tion and prosecution of human trafficking without harming their relationship with victims 
or worsening the situation of victims.42 This is an issue that is also being considered in the 
so-called chain approaches to human trafficking that are being developed in various cities 
(see §7.6.2).

Private citizens/clients of prostitutes
Reports from members of the public contribute to the information possessed by the police 
and is therefore very important. This applies to a large extent to human trafficking as well, 
where there is little willingness to make a complaint. One specific group of citizens who are 
able to identify human trafficking are clients of prostitutes. The follow-up to the campaign 
Schijn bedriegt [Appearances are deceptive] run by the foundation Report Crime Anony-
mously [Stichting Meld Misdaad Anoniem (M)]NRM5 was launched in 2008. Its aim is to teach 
clients of prostitutes to recognise the signs of coerced prostitution and to encourage them 
to report information about it to the police or, anonymously, to M.43 The campaign uses

2009, p. 12. Meanwhile, there is now a toolkit for anyone working in places such as shelters for victims of human 
trafficking. At the time this report was written, the toolkit was scheduled to be launched during the Human 
Trafficking Conference on 29 October 2009. The toolkit consists of a package of instruments and documents 
that can be used by every service or agency that encounters indications of human trafficking, explaining how 
indications of human trafficking should be registered and when and under what conditions signs can be 
exchanged with other services. See Human Trafficking Task Force (2009b).

leaflets, advertisements and posters. Short films are posted on erotic internet sites, in which 
clients are first seduced with titillating images, but then presented with steadily more con-
frontational indications of coercion in prostitution. The films end with an appeal to pass on 
information to the police. Zaitch and Staring44 conclude, in a study of prostitutes’ clients, 
that, even if they are aware of indicators of human trafficking, clients generally disregard 
that knowledge as soon as they are face to face with the prostitute of their choice. They put 
having a good time with a prostitute first and close their eyes to information they might not 
want to know. Accordingly, clients of window prostitutes in Amsterdam say that they almost 
never observe signs of human trafficking.45 The question is whether clients would take ac-
tion if they recognised abuses. It seems that this is true only to a limited extent. Operators/
managers of sex establishments might also be in a position to warn of human trafficking (see 
below).
Like the earlier campaign two years ago, the new campaign by the M foundation led to more 
anonymous reports of coerced prostitution (147 in 2008), which prompted a number of po-
lice investigations, five of which have since been successfully completed.46 There are some 
critical reservations to be made about the M line, however. There is a risk that false infor-
mation will be given, intentionally or otherwise, for example. It is therefore important for 
information from the M line to be confirmed by further investigation by the police and the 
public prosecution service.47 In a general sense, it is important that citizens are informed 
what had been done with their report, since this will increase the willingness to report. Gen-
erally speaking, this is not done enough in practice.48 Report Crime Anonymously is trying 
to improve the feedback,49 but it is also difficult to receive feedback from the police about 
what has been done with reports.50

Operators of sex establishments
Schone Schijn discussed the capacity of operators and managers of sex establishments to 
identify human trafficking.51 These people have regular contact with the prostitutes working 
for them and can therefore recognise abuses. According to the report, operators/managers 
do report abuses, but it appears – given the scale of the Sneep case, for example – that they 
either observe very little or display little willingness to report abuses. The latter might per-
haps be because it could damage their financial interests or because of risks to their own 
safety (human traffickers can be very violent). On the other hand, they might be complicit 
in human trafficking. For example, Schone Schijn showed that some operators of windows

also provide accommodation for prostitutes at exorbitant rents and maintain contact and 
do business with pimps. Earlier research by the BNRMNRM3 also shows that police officers 
believe that while many operators might not be guilty of human trafficking, they are aware 
of it.

IND
Officials of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) can also identify situations 
of human trafficking. The IND has issued working instructions for identifying victims and 
potential victims of human trafficking during the asylum procedure. The IND has said,52 
among other things, that evident victims are only occasionally identified. In many cases, 
the individuals are identified as possible victims. These indications are not registered in the 
IND’s information systems, but are recorded manually. Consequently, it is impossible to 
give a precise and reliable overview of the number of identifications, according to the IND.
Sometimes it is evident that a person is a victim, but in most cases the IND only has a sus-
picion that something is wrong. In other words, it may encounter a serious indication, a 
suspicion, a false alarm or an incredible story. This means that the number of registered 
indications must not be confused with the number of victims discovered during the asylum 
procedure. According to the IND, the latter figure cannot be established. As an indication, 
the IND said that around 100 indications of human trafficking were registered in the asylum 
procedure up to the middle of August 2009.

The IND also observed that many Bulgarians and Romanians report to the IND as self-em-
ployed persons. The IND officials do find indications of human trafficking among them, and 
they are reported to the EMM.53 It might be necessary to review, revise and guarantee the 
current agreements on the exchange of information between the EMM and the IND.54

Schiphol/Royal Netherlands Marechaussee
Some victims of human trafficking arrive in the Netherlands at Schiphol.NRM3/5 The Royal 
Netherlands Marechaussee55 is responsible for anyone who is stopped or refused entry at 
Schiphol and who displays signs of human trafficking. After 2006, the Marechaussee en-
countered a remarkable number of underage Nigerian girls without valid travel documents 
who requested asylum at Schiphol. These unaccompanied underage asylum seekers56 then 
disappeared almost immediately after their arrival in the asylum centres. Some of them were 
later found working as prostitutes in the Netherlands and Belgium. This created the suspi-
cion that they were victims of human trafficking and led to a number of investigations, with 
varying degrees of success.NRM5 Another phenomenon was that unaccompanied underage

asylum seekers arriving at Schiphol would claim that they were victims of human traffick-
ing, be allowed to stay on the grounds of the B9 regulation and then contact their traffickers, 
who would then collect them and force them into prostitution. The precise methods they 
used and the police investigations into them are described in §9.5. In any case, this also led 
to questions about Schiphol’s role as a ‘nodal orientation point’57 in human trafficking, ques-
tions that culminated in a conference,58 an internal research report and an action plan. There 
are distinct times when indications of human trafficking can be discerned at Schiphol.59 
During the gate checks for risk flights60 officers also look out for signs of passengers who 
are or could be involved in human trafficking.61 Persons who are refused entry at the border 
can request asylum. They are brought to the IND’s reporting centre and interviewed and a 
suspicion of human trafficking may emerge during that interview. Persons who request asy-
lum are appointed a lawyer, who might also find that the individual could be a victim of hu-
man trafficking. Persons who do not report human trafficking and whose asylum request is 
denied are placed in aliens detention, where they can still be recognised as victims of human 
trafficking by the Repatriation and Departure Service (DT&V) (see §8.3.2). Since 1 Janu-
ary 2009, (possible) victims of human trafficking who enter the country through Schiphol 
can also be granted a reflection period (see §2.3). This happened twice during the first five 
months of 2009.62

The Marechaussee has taken various measures to improve the recognition of victims. For 
example, victim profiles have been drawn up, which are used by the rapid action teams (see 
§8.6). The escort agencies that use hotels at Schiphol are also inspected as part of the super-
vision of the licensed prostitution sector.63 Since (possible) victims of human trafficking are 
also offered the reflection period at Schiphol, the Marechaussee, IND and DT&V are draft-
ing a protocol setting out who is responsible for these victims, and when. As part of an action 
plan drawn up by the Marechaussee for the Human Trafficking Task Force, an effort will be 
made to raise awareness among all Marechaussee officers. The Marechaussee have also set 
up a working group to implement the action plan.64

57 This is a reference to the ‘nodal police’ concept, where monitoring and checks are targeted at nodes in the 
infrastructure. See Bekkers et al. (2006; 2007, pp. 12-16); Vision Document Police in Development, 2005.

58 On 24 October 2007, the Youth and Vice Squad of the Intelligence & Information Brigade of the Roy-
al Netherlands Marechaussee at Schiphol organised a conference on the theme of ‘Human trafficking at 
Schiphol?’.

Tax authorities
The tax authorities carry out regular audits in the prostitution sector.65 The tax inspectors 
are issued with lists of indicators of human trafficking and take those lists with them during 
the audits. They do sometimes find indications of human trafficking and pass them on to the 
police. The tax authorities can also encounter human trafficking when issuing tax and social 
security (Sofi) numbers to prostitutes. The relevant employees have not followed a special 
course to recognise indications of human trafficking. The aim is to issue a tax and social 
security number as soon as possible.66 Nevertheless, they do sometimes recognise signs and 
report them to the police. For example, at the beginning of 2009 several women called to the 
tax authorities to apply for a tax and social security number. The women were clearly scared 
and nervous and did not have their own passports with them (they were in the possession 
of another person who had accompanied them). The official reported this to the police. In 
another case, an employee reported that a women had a false passport (according to her 
passport, she was 25, but this seemed highly unlikely). This girl, who proved to be 15, was 
then identified by the police as a victim of human trafficking. The suspects were arrested and 
tried.
From 1 January 2009 the people who let windows to prostitutes are covered by the turnover 
tax legislation and have to keep accounts. In principle, therefore, the tax authorities will be 
aware of every prostitute working behind the windows. That information could probably be 
shared in some way with the police.

Municipalities and chambers of commerce
The report Schone Schijn discussed the capacity of various institutions, including munici-
palities and chambers of commerce, to identify human trafficking.67 These organisations feel 
they have few possibilities to do so. Municipalities encounter victims of human trafficking 
when they register in the Municipal Basic Registration of Population Data (GBA), when they 
have to identify themselves and give an address, but if a victim registers with the correct 
papers, there is very little chance of identifying them as a victim of human trafficking. Cham-
bers of commerce have a similar problem. The police therefore plan to train employees of 
chambers of commerce to recognise victims who want to register with them.68 There are 
other municipal agencies that could come across indications of human trafficking, such as 
the building inspection department. It is important for this information to be shared with 
the police

65 The aim is to identify illegal and undocumented workers, to establish the employment relationships and the 
accuracy of the accounts. Source: Van Hout & Van der Laan (2008).

Identification of human trafficking by the municipality
Perhaps lessons could be drawn from a project in which municipalities shared information 
with the police about radicalisation. This project took place in the province of Zeeland in 
2007/2008. Set up in the context of counter-terrorism, its objective was to increase aware-
ness among municipal employees of signs of radicalisation that they might come across during 
their work and to encourage them to report their findings to the police. The municipalities in 
Zeeland were not all enthusiastic about taking part in the project. Many municipalities initially 
argued that radicalisation was not a problem for them. However, this position was untenable 
since a terrorist group known as the Hofstad Group also had a branch in Zeeland. The system 
of identification was arranged as follows: every participating municipality appointed a contact 
person for ‘radicalisation’, to whom officials could report indications of radicalisation. The 
contact person then passed the reports (without identifying the subjects) to the police, which 
had established a reporting centre in the Regional Intelligence Service. The contact persons 
followed a short course to learn to recognise signs of radicalisation on the basis of a list of 
indicators.
Feedback is important. In projects of this type, a common complaint is that ‘I did report, 
but never heard anything more about it’. That is demotivating. It was therefore decided that 
feedback would be given on every report (how valuable the report was, whether anything 
was already known about the suspects, etc.). The project ultimately generated 17 reports in 
all, all based on a person’s gut feeling. Other, more specific indications were perhaps reported 
through regular channels.69

8.3.2	 Identification	during	the	repatriation	process	or	in	aliens	detention

An alien who is not living legally in the Netherlands must leave the country voluntarily and 
may, if necessary, be deported. In January 2007, a separate organisation, the Repatriation and 
Departure Service (DT&V), was established to arrange the repatriation of aliens.70 DT&V 
encourages aliens who do not qualify for a residence permit to depart voluntarily by holding a 
series of interviews with them, all conducted by the same departure supervisor.71 On the basis 
of the interviews, a departure plan is drawn up by the regional offices for repatriation facilita-
tion, in consultation with the alien.
An alien can enter the DT&V programme at two different times: (1) after a request for asy-
lum in the Netherlands has been rejected, (2) after being placed in aliens detention. Because 
their clients could include victims of human trafficking. DT&V drew up the Procedural pro-
tocol for victims of human trafficking at the beginning of 2008. The protocol gives a step-
by-step description of what a departure supervisor should do if a person might be a victim 
of human trafficking. When the service identifies victims of human trafficking, it reports 
them to the police or the Marechaussee, which then interview the alien and may record the

Service (IND) and the Aliens Police, and some of the tasks of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, relating 
to repatriation are delegated to this department.

71 This is an attempt to ensure an individual approach. It can also help to create a relationship of trust with 
aliens by making them familiar with a particular individual and knowing who they should go to with any 
questions or problems.

victim’s report human trafficking or offer the reflection period.72 In those cases, the DT&V’s 
responsibility is then at an end. If the victim does not report (or otherwise provide coopera-
tion) and is not offered or does not accept the offer of a reflection period,73 the repatriation 
process resumes.

The BNRM investigated how many victims of human trafficking had been identified by 
DT&V during the return and departure process.74 There had been 16 from the time the 
service was established in January 2007 until September 2008, according to its registra-
tion system. There may have been more since the registration of victims of human traf-
ficking is not optimal.75 All 16 victims who were identified were women. Eight came from 
China and five from Nigeria. The other three victims came from Armenia, Ghana and 
Sierra Leone.

An important question is whether it would have been possible to identify these victims be-
fore they entered the repatriation and departure process. Information about this was avail-
able for 12 of the 16 victims,76 showing that eight were detained in connection with illegal 
residence in the Netherlands or abroad.77 In that context, they had been in contact with the 
aliens police or the Marechaussee. In four of those cases, indications of human trafficking 
had been recognised or the victim had reported. This led in each of these cases – although 
not always directly – to an investigation into human trafficking. Three victims were initially 
placed in detention but later released or transferred to suitable shelter. The fourth victim 
was not detained, but did have a departure interview with DT&V. The result was that they 
were registered by DT&V, but DT&V actually played no role in recognising the human traf-
ficking.
In other words, four of the victims who were detained for living here illegally were not rec-
ognised as victims by the aliens police or the Marechaussee. In three of these cases, the 
victims did provide indications of human trafficking during an interview. For example, two 
women said that they had to work in prostitution abroad, and one said that she had to work 
for three years in the Netherlands in exchange for the journey. The women were not further 
questioned about these claims. All four women were placed in detention. There were two 
victims who were then identified by their lawyer, one who was identified by BLinN and one 
by DT&V.

72 When the alien is in aliens detention and will not make a complaint, the police and public prosecution service 
decide whether he or she will be offered a period of reflection (see also Chapter 5).

73 If necessary, after the reflection period has been used.

Case of Nigerian women
Two Nigerian women entering the Netherlands through Schiphol matched an established risk 
profile: young Nigerian women who did not know what country they had been brought to, 
seemed bewildered, claimed not to know what they would be doing in the Netherlands, had 
not organised the journey themselves and had also not paid for the trip. The women therefore 
had an intake interview as possible victims of human trafficking but they denied being victims 
(possibly because they had not yet worked in prostitution). Consequently, both women entered 
an asylum procedure. The women were later collected from the asylum centre by their exploit-
ers and brought to another country, where they were exploited until they were arrested by the 
foreign authorities. Both women then returned to the Netherlands (on the basis of the Dublin 
claim). Once back in the Netherlands, ‘case 1’ was properly dealt with by the various agencies, 
but ‘case 2’ was not. As has already been mentioned, it was not clear to everyone that she was 
a victim of human trafficking. Consequently, the victim in ‘case 2’ was placed in aliens deten-
tion, where she was treated as an alien who would be deported from the country. It was more 
than four months before she was interviewed and her complaint was recorded. The reason for 
this was that the suspects were members of an organised network that was the subject of an 
international investigation. The authorities wanted to wait until the ‘international action day’, 
when all the suspects around the world would be arrested (see §9.5).

In 10 cases an investigation was conducted into human trafficking. (In these cases the victims 
also made a complaint.) In some cases, this probably led to a decision not to prosecute;78 in 
others, suspects were arrested and, in one instance, the case had already gone to trial.79 In a 
few cases, it is not yet clear how the investigation will end.

Case of general amnesty
Two Chinese women went to Ter Apel to apply for asylum following rumours in the Chinese 
community in the Netherlands that a general amnesty was being granted for illegal aliens. They 
were detained and interviewed by the IND. The lawyer of one of the women alerted the IND 
to the fact that she was a victim of human trafficking. She was said to have been smuggled into 
the Netherlands and in return had to clean a massage parlour (she refused to give erotic mas-
sages). But the public prosecutor found that it was not a case of human trafficking and that 
there were no leads, and abandoned the investigation on those grounds. The woman is still in 
detention. The other woman stated that she had been raped during the trip to the Netherlands. 
This was seen as a possible indication of human trafficking and the Marechaussee conducted 
an intake interview with the woman, from which it emerged that there was no question of hu-
man trafficking. No investigation of human trafficking was started. This woman is also still in 
aliens detention.

To sum up, in one case the DT&V recognised a victim in aliens detention without possess-
ing any information in advance of that possibility. In the other cases, the victims had been 
recognised by other agencies, but nevertheless placed in aliens detention or in a repatriation 
programme and, as a result, ultimately registered by the DT&V as victims. In some cases 
this happened because the victim denied being a victim. Two of the victims finally said that 

78 Because there are few leads for an investigation and/or the facts took place a long time before, which compli-
cates the investigation.

they were victims and reported human trafficking during the departure interview. On the 
other hand, it is unclear how often the DT&V fails to recognise victims of human traffick-
ing. The departure supervisor interviews aliens to arrange their repatriation. During these 
interviews, the supervisor should also analyse whether the individual concerned is a victim 
of human trafficking. BNRM’s research shows, however, that the average departure inter-
view lasts 20 minutes, which does not leave enough time to thoroughly investigate whether a 
person actually is a victim of human trafficking.
In contrast to the IND, the departure supervisor has no questionnaire that can be used to as-
sess whether a case involves human trafficking. If the victim does not tell her own story dur-
ing the interview, it is almost impossible for the supervisor to recognise a (possible) victim 
of human trafficking.
According to the procedural protocol for victims of human trafficking, the DT&V’s task 
is limited: it reports any victims of human trafficking that it encounters in detention to the 
police or the Marechaussee. Its formal responsibility ends there. If the police do not conduct 
an intake interview or record a complaint after a report from the DT&V, the deportation 
process proceeds.

Four of the 12 victims had, in fact, recently had dealings with the IND. In three of these cas-
es, the IND identified indications of human trafficking during the interview and contacted 
the police or the Marechaussee, requesting them to conduct an intake interview with the 
individual concerned to ascertain whether it was a genuine case of human trafficking. In the 
fourth case, the individual was already known to be a victim human trafficking. However, it 
is also not known how often the IND fails to identify indications of human trafficking, since 
those cases are difficult or impossible to trace. Some of the individuals had in fact previously 
had contact with the IND in connection with an asylum application. It is not known how the 
IND responded at that time.
In the cases investigated the relevant agencies were not always alert enough to spot indica-
tions of human trafficking, but it also emerged that the victims themselves did not always 
disclose the fact. Also, some talked about their experiences to one agency, but not to another. 
The reasons for the victim’s reluctance to talk about their experiences were examined in 
earlier reports of the NRM (voodoo, debts, shame, fear, trauma, mistrust of government 
agencies, danger in the event of their return to their country of origin). On the other hand, 
there might also be reasons why they would make a claim of human trafficking (see §5.3 on 
‘abuse’ of the B9 regulation). What emerged during this study was that the interviewees had 
doubts about the authenticity of the victims’ claims of human trafficking. There was also 
some uncertainty about how exploitation should be defined. For example, there were two 
cases where a person worked as a cleaner for a number of years in exchange for the trip to the 
Netherlands; in one case the public prosecution service regarded it as human trafficking; in 
the other, it did not.

BLinN provides support for victims of human trafficking in aliens detention and has pub-
lished reports of its experiences and the problems it has encountered (see also Chapter 4).

The police must always record reports of human trafficking, even when the complainants 
are in detention. Nevertheless, the police “did not act or acted too late on the majority of 
BLinN’s requests on behalf of victims in detention who wanted to make a complaint, left 
victims waiting in detention for weeks or even longer for an intake interview, or afterwards 
would not offer a reflection period or record an official complaint”.80 According to BLinN, 
the same applies for the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. One of the reasons for this is 
that there are not enough detectives certified to handle human trafficking cases available to 
record complaints.81 Furthermore, the police do not always believe claims of human traffick-
ing, according to BLinN, and arresting illegal aliens sometimes takes priority.
Victims are not recognised by the police or Royal Netherlands Marechaussee before they are 
placed in aliens detention. BLinN agrees that it is not always possible, but there have been 
cases where indications have been missed.82 Victims of other forms of exploitation are more 
difficult to recognise than victims of sexual exploitation. One reason for this is that the defi-
nition of ‘other forms of exploitation’ is unclear, but the police and Marechaussee also seem 
to focus mainly on sexual exploitation. However, BLinN has observed a positive trend: there 
have been improvements in the recognition of human trafficking, intakes and complaints are 
recorded sooner and reflection periods are offered more often. BLinN praises the approach 
taken by the Rotterdam-Rijnmond police force, which interviews all undocumented women 
who are arrested to discover whether they may be victims.83

8.3.3 Information and follow-up

The police wants to be an ‘intelligence organisation’: in other words, an organisation that it 
is driven by the information it gathers and analyses.84 To this end, the Police Data Act has 
been amended (see §2.5) and the National Intelligence Model (NIM) has been developed85 to 
bolster the concept of Intelligence Led Policing (ILP).NRM5 Intelligence Led Policing plays a 
role at the policy level86 and in investigations.87

82 For example, BLinN came across more than 20 migrants in border detention who gave the same story in ap-

plying for asylum. This is an indication of human trafficking. BLinN also mentions four victims who went 
to the police to make a complaint but were not recognised as victims and were placed in aliens detention 
(Boermans, 2009, p. 30).

83 The Rotterdam-Rijnmond police force has also developed instruments that can be used during these inter-
views.

84 See also the recently published Doctrine of Intelligence Led Policing (Police Academy (2009, p. 9), which 
gives the following definition of intelligence: Intelligence is analysed information and knowledge on the 
grounds of which decisions are made about the performance of police duties.

The sharing of information between police forces has been another problematic area for 
years.88 There are currently a number developments underway in this area89 and some results 
have already been achieved. For example, some of the information available to the police can 
be shared with ‘Blueview’.90 Intelligence can also be shared via the so-called NIK-RIK line.91 
In this context, it is important that all the facilities that have been developed are actually used 
which often calls mainly for a change in terms of behaviour.92 There are also specific bodies 
that provide the police with information about human trafficking: the Centre of Expertise in 
Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (see below) and the Operational Consultation 
Group on Trafficking in Human Beings,NRM5 in which regional police forces exchange opera-
tional information on human trafficking.

Centre of Expertise on Human Trafficking and Human Smuggling
The Centre of Expertise on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (EMM) is the nation-
al collection centre for the police for information about human trafficking for the police.NRM5 
The information is supplied to the EMM by agencies concerned with human trafficking in a 
supervisory, monitoring or investigative capacity or in providing assistance.93 The police are 
actually obliged to supply the information.94 EMM analyses this and other95 information and 
incorporates it in proposals for investigations, administrative reports, crime analyses, news-
letters and other products and services for the police and other relevant organisations. So-
called level-3 information (concerning serious and organised human trafficking) is passed on 
to the FIET (see §8.2).
There has been criticism of how the EMM functions.96 It does not receive information 
from all police forces and other agencies and there is too little analysis of the information 

88 The Netherlands Court of Audit has found shortcomings in the exchange of information between the na-
tional and regional police forces in various reports,. The Public Order and Safety Inspectorate then ordered 
an investigation, the results of which were published at the end of 2004. (Public Order and Safety Inspec-
torate, 2006; Replies to Questions from Algra MP, 1 May 2006 (Schedule to Parliamentary Proceedings II 
2005/06, no. 1346); Report of the Advisory Committee on Security Information Flows, 2007.

89 The Basic Enforcement Facility (BVH), the Basic Investigation Facility (BVO) and the Basic Information 
Facility (BVI) are in development. These are at various stages of development or implementation. (See, for 
example, the report of the Public Order and Safety Inspectorate, 2008).

90 All records of complaints, interviews, official reports, file, reports and documents about goods that have 
been confiscated in the last five years in the Netherlands can be found and searched with Blueview (Police 
Academy, 2009, p. 47).

91 A National Information Node (NIK) has been established at the National Criminal Intelligence Department 
(dNRI). Each force has a Regional Information Node (RIK). Information is exchanged through this channel.

92 Public Order and Safety Inspectorate, 2008.
93 The EMM is part of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (dNR) of the National Police Agency (KLPD). 

It is partnership with the National Criminal Intelligence Service (dNRI), the Royal Netherlands Marechaus-
see (KMar), the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and the Social Intelligence and Investigation 
Service (SIOD). The Task Organisation for Alien Care (TOV) also recently became a partner in EMM.

tries and other relevant information (for example, from foreign police forces) is also collected.

that the EMM does possess.97 Almost everyone agrees that an institution like the EMM is 
needed and is useful, but its disappointing output makes its customers and partners scep-
tical. The EMM therefore intended to conduct a strategic reorientation in the course of 
2009.98

A study into information exchange in relation to combating human trafficking and human smug-
gling
The above findings are in line with the results of a study into the exchange of information in re-
lation to combating human trafficking and migrant smuggling conducted by the KLPD’s Inter-
national Police Intelligence Service (IPOL).99 The study, which was carried out for the Human 
Trafficking Task Force, concluded that the EMM struggles with the allocation of resources to 
its various tasks and has concentrated mainly on collecting and processing all indications of 
human trafficking in recent years. However, sharing the information with the regional forc-
es seems fairly inefficient and there are a number of gaps. For example, the study found that 
the EMM does not process all of the indications it receives. The police regions also do not all 
share the indications of human trafficking with the EMM, partly because they feel the feed-
back from the EMM is inadequate. Both the Marechaussee and the police regions say that the 
EMM needs to perform its role as chain director more robustly. The recommendations made 
in the study relate to improvements in automation, a better division of tasks and roles, specific 
binding agreements on the quality of the information provided and the feedback to the chain 
partners, improvement in the quality of the analysis by the EMM and closer cooperation with 
the administrative authorities.

It is particularly important to make use of information available from other partners in the 
chain for investigations into human trafficking. Because of the unwillingness of victims to 
cooperate with investigations, accumulating information from different sources is very im-
portant for putting a case together.NRM5 Possible partners mentioned in the Reference Model 
include administrative supervisory authorities, the Labour Inspectorate, the tax authorities, 
embassies, the IND, chambers of commerce, MOT/BLOM, BIBOB, social investigation de-
partments of municipalities, housing associations, the UWV, SVB and various social-service 
and health-care agencies. The WODC conducted a study100 into four police investigations of 
human trafficking, in which it also investigated how information was shared. It found that 
the exchange of information was normal during the investigation, both within the organi-
sation itself and with external parties, as well as with international investigative agencies. 
Information was also shared with administrative bodies. However, the exchange of informa-
tion with chain partners left something to be desired.101 In practice, sharing information is 
often a time-consuming and difficulty process. One of the reasons for this is uncertainty and 
confusion about the possibilities and conditions for sharing information. To remove these

doubts, five ministers102 concluded an administrative agreement on the exchange of informa-
tion: the National Agreement on a ‘Decentralised Approach to Organised Crime’.103 In its 
action plan, the Human Trafficking Task Force mentioned further actions and quick wins 
with which the problem is being addressed. One was the development of a toolkit of instruments 
and documents that can be used to enquire how indications of human trafficking can be re-
corded and exchanged.

Collecting, analysing and following up information
The study into the causes of shelved cases (see §8.5) explored how indications of human 
trafficking reached the police and how they were dealt with. In all of the regions studied, 
police databases were scanned for possible information about human trafficking on a daily 
or weekly basis. Information that the police deem ‘worthy of investigation’, sometimes 
after upgrading, is always discussed with the public prosecutor. But what are cases ‘wor-
thy of investigation’? Who decides which are, and when? The initial decision on which 
cases are worth investigating is made by the police themselves, who then submit them to 
the public prosecutor. If there are indications of human trafficking calling for a prompt 
response, there is immediate telephone contact with the public prosecutor responsible for 
human trafficking cases and an investigation can start immediately. In less urgent situa-
tions, the police wait until the periodic ‘preliminary review’, at which the cases worthy of 
investigation are discussed and it is decided whether more information needs to be col-
lected or whether an investigation can start. Cases sometimes have to be submitted to a 
regional ‘review committee’ before an investigation can start. This is not usually necessary 
for small investigations, which a human trafficking team can carry out itself, for example, 
but this procedure is often followed in the case of larger investigations or if there is no hu-
man trafficking team.
In practice, the police receive a very large number of indications of human trafficking. In 
accordance with the Instruction on Human Trafficking, these indications must all be inves-
tigated and, if possible, prosecuted. According to some respondents, this is impossible in 
practice and gradations are applied: some indications are investigated administratively and/
or tactically, others are not. This causes dilemmas, although the respondents were unani-
mous that an investigation will always start immediately in certain cases, if there is a pos-
sibility that a minor is involved or a victim is being held captive, for example.

Collecting, analysing and upgrading information in eight police forces
There is no uniform method used in the eight forces investigated.104 Records are kept of all 
information that the police receive or collect themselves,105 which are then registered in Xpol/
BPS.106 Every record is assigned a specific incident code.107 Because a single record can contain 
information about different types of crime and often only one incident code is assigned to it, it 
is possible that all the information about human trafficking is not actually registered under the 
incident code for human trafficking or white slavery. This is why all police information has to 
be analysed for possible evidence of human trafficking. In all of the police regions investigated, 
police files are scanned for possible information about human trafficking on a daily or weekly 
basis.108 In seven of the eight police regions, this process is automated:109 a software program 
is used to search databases on certain words – such as ‘coercion’, ‘prostitution’ and ‘loverboy’ 
(although the search words used differ from one region to another) – and/or incident codes.110 
The information that is selected in this way is then read by one or more persons111 to deter-
mine112 whether the information does actually concern (and therefore contain indications of) 
human trafficking. The information about human trafficking distilled from Xpol/BPS with 
these forms of analysis is saved electronically or in a folder.
The information is then ‘upgraded’, in police jargon, which means that more information 
is collected about an indication, for example by checking whether more information can be 
found about the suspect or the victim. The police might also talk to the individuals concerned 
or drive by a certain address. By extension, information is ‘aggregated’ in order to gather suf-
ficient evidence – if possible – for a criminal case without a complaint by a victim.NRM5

The next question is: What will the police do with all the information? There is a risk that the 
police will increasingly be faced with the dilemma of being aware of more crimes but having 
to tolerate them because of a shortage of capacity.113 The ban on not dealing with casesNRM5 is 
intended to protect victims of human trafficking against this eventuality.

Treatment of victims
The police also have a task with respect to victims they encounter. For example, victims must 
be informed of the possibilities of receiving practical, emotional and legal support, of claim-
ing damages and of filing an objection if a decision is taken not to prosecute. Employees who 

104 The terminology also differs from one regional force to another. In this document, the most common terms 
are always used.

105 Indications/reports are recorded on paper by the police (records). These records can then be registered in 
the police computer system.

106 Xpol and the Basis Process System (BPS) are the police’s computer systems where, in the police regions 
investigated, all records are registered. The system that is used depends on the police region.

107 Incident codes are numbers that indicate the subject matter of a record. Examples are 344 (human traffick-
ing), 29 (special attention) and 801 (prostitution control).

108 The number of records involved differs by day and by region. No estimate can be made from the information 
acquired in the study of shelved cases.

109 In one region, it is the task of the human trafficking team to manually scan the daily records.
110 In six of the seven regions where scanning is automated, records are scanned on a combination of search 

words and incident codes. In one region, records are scanned only on the incident codes.
111 In one region this is done by the force’s expert, in one region by the Vice Squad’s process coordinator, in 

three regions by permanent employees of the Information Desk and in three regions by various detectives.
112 This is done on the basis of the knowledge, instinct and experience of these persons.

conduct the ‘intake interview’114 with the victim, who record the complaint or who interro-
gate victims must be qualified.115 Victims who are living illegally in the Netherlands must be 
given the opportunity to apply for the B9 regulation.116 The police attach great importance 
to the treatment of victims, as is apparent from the fact that forces can only receive a posi-
tive rating (‘green’) in the Police Force Monitor if their rating on the dimension ‘treatment 
of victims’ is ‘green’. With two exceptions, every force met this standard in 2006. The police 
themselves also say that “from the perspective of the interests of the victims of human traf-
ficking, any departure from the standard is one too many […]”.117 The fact that the correct 
procedures are not always followed is also apparent from other information and reports, 
particularly from institutions that provide help for and represent the interests of victims (see 
also Chapter 4).

Shelter for victims
The police and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee at Schiphol still often encounter prob-
lems in arranging shelter for victims. The main bottlenecks are the limited accessibility (by 
telephone) of CoMensha and other aid agencies and the shortage of suitable shelters. The 
pilot project with categorical shelter may provide a solution for this (see §4.6.2).
The time spent by the police transporting victims between shelters and to and from court 
has been a problem for years; however, an agreement has been concluded with the Ministry 
of Justice’s Transport and Support Service (DV&O), which has assumed this task from the 
police.118

8.4	 Investigation	of	human	trafficking

While the police and public prosecution service give priority to human trafficking,119 it is only 
one of their many priorities. Furthermore, the police are permanently faced with more crime 
than they can deal with. In practice, therefore, police forces have to juggle their resources 
and human trafficking does not always receive the attention it should (and in some forces, 
none at all).120 Even the Police Force Monitor 2007 stated that “despite this high priority […] 
individual forces can apparently exercise a large degree of policy freedom.” (p. 67). The fi-

114 This is an informal interview that takes place before a complaint might be made.
115 These employees must have a certificate for handling human trafficking cases. Some police forces, but also 

other agencies (such as the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee and SIOD) have a shortage of ‘certified’ staff.
116 This accords with the Instruction on Human Trafficking.
117 Police Force Monitor (2007, p. 67).
118 DV&O is a national service of the Custodial Institutions Service (DJI), which arranges the transport of ar-

rested persons, prisoners, aliens and goods and prison files for the Ministry of Justice.
119 For example, human trafficking is mentioned in the Joint National Priorities of the Police 2008-2011 (1 June 

2007). In speeches to the police superintendents of the Amsterdam-Amstelland region and the KLPD, hu-
man trafficking was also mentioned as a priority (23 May 2008 and 5 January 2009 respectively). See also 
Convenant Uitvoering Politiële Vreemdelingentaak 2009–2011.

120 A team of detectives that has already been formed may sometimes have to give up resources because of 
events that have priority and require a lot of capacity, such as a murder.

nal reference in the Reference Framework for Human Trafficking relates to the allocation of 
resources. It states that “such a priority [deserves] a specific allocation of resources subject 
to an absolute full-time minimum” (p. 22). The indicated standard is that “every force should 
deploy sufficient capacity to carry out investigations into human trafficking […]” (p. 22). 
However, there does not seem to be a clear obligation to achieve results.121 That choices can be 
made is apparent from the fact that there are some police forces that are capable of deploying 
the necessary capacity for human trafficking.

Aliens police
The investigation of human trafficking is increasingly delegated to the aliens police (under 
the title ‘migration-related crime’).122 Those involved say that the aliens police sometimes 
devote too little attention to human trafficking. They formerly focused on tackling illegal 
immigration, leaving little room for the detection of victims. Their thinking and attitude in 
that regard needs to change, which is indeed happening in a growing number of forces. The 
agreement on police immigration tasks for 2009-2011 also addresses the issue of human traf-
ficking and its victims.

Community police123

While human trafficking often has an international component, it is equally a local phenom-
enon and locally embedded. The activities of prostitutes and human traffickers are often con-
centrated in certain districts, neighbourhoods and streets or prostitution zones. Victims who 
work in window or street prostitution spend a large part of the day on or close to the street, 
where they are visible to and have contact with people on the street. This integration of human 
trafficking in the locality means there are possibilities for the use of the community police in in-
vestigations. The community police operate at local level and are the eyes and ears of the police 
on the street. Community officers can collect information by observing what is going on and 
through their direct and regular contact with people on the street and in the neighbourhood. 
Consequently, the community police can build up a relationship of trust with people in the 
neighbourhood, usually more quickly than other divisions of the force. The community police 
also patrol in areas with window prostitution and therefore often know the women who are 
working there. Accordingly, they can identify signs of abuse, exploitation and human traffick-
ing. They can also serve as contact persons for the women if they have problems. As research 
by the WODC has shown, the active involvement of community police in human trafficking 
cases seems to have a positive effect on the evidence collected.124

121 However, the specified standard is the ratio between the number of investigations planned and carried out, 
but it would seem more appropriate to look at the number of indications/complaints with leads that have 
been received and/or have been dealt with (or a force should not have any shelved cases). That is easier to 
monitor if – Reference Framework p. 12 – “there is a central location where all indications are collected, ana-
lysed, upgraded and collated.”

122 The Police Force Monitor 2007 refers to this as a possible reason why not all forces use multidisciplinary 
teams in investigations into human trafficking.

123 This section is taken almost verbatim from the study by Van Gestel & Verhoeven (2009).

National and Supra-Regional Crime Squads
The National and Supra-Regional criminal squads also carry out investigations into human 
trafficking. The SneepNRM5 and Koolvis cases (see §9.5.5) were just two of the investigations 
the National Crime Squad was involved in the last few years. In 2008, the Supra-Regional 
Crime Squad conducted two human trafficking investigations.125 However, the national and 
supra-regional crime squads also lack sufficient capacity, although an investigation involving 
a number of regions does not necessarily have to be conducted by the national or supra-re-
gional crime squad. It is possible for a number of regional forces to conduct an investigation 
and simply divide the tasks.

Strategies in investigations into human trafficking
A study carried out by WODC also explored strategies adopted in human trafficking inves-
tigations.126 Four human-trafficking cases were studied in depth. All of the cases involved 
suspects who used violence and intimidation to coerce women into working in window pros-
titution. Different strategies were employed in the four investigations, according to the cir-
cumstances, the background, the information available at the start of the investigation and 
the objective of the investigation. A distinction was made between investigations based on a 
report of the crime, public order, the criminal organisation and the offence.
The complaint-driven investigation was characterised by a focus on securing reports and 
statements from victims of human trafficking. To achieve this, the investigating team made 
an effort to win the trust of victims and secure their active cooperation. One way they tried 
to do this was by actively involving the community police in the investigation. The vice squad 
and other persons in their network that the victims could trust (such as interpreters, social 
workers or religious figures) were also used to promote communication with the victims. 
The investigators then secured complaints, which contained a lot of information and leads 
for the investigation (as well as leading to other victims). In a complaint-driven investigation 
of this type, there is a chance that victims will make complaints and so provide more infor-
mation about the methods and organisation of human traffickers. However, one of the risks 
in this method is that a lot is invested in contact with the victim, who might eventually not 
make a complaint or a statement.
In the investigation based on ‘public order’, the police were not only investigating human 
trafficking but also wanted to end a situation that was causing a public nuisance (arguments, 
fights and intimidation) on the street. To tackle the nuisance, the investigators collaborated 
with the municipality and exchanged information. The municipality used this information 
to revoke the licences of premises that served as meeting places for the human traffickers 
and so curbed the physical presence of the human traffickers who were causing the nuisance. 
This latter aspect was an added bonus: the human traffickers were driven out and the situa-
tion where the municipality was unconsciously facilitating human trafficking was avoided.

319

However, the risk of focusing on public nuisance is that the gathering of evidence of human 
trafficking could be hampered.
In the organisation-driven strategy, the emphasis was on identifying the members of the 
criminal organisation. The Sneep case is a good example of such an investigation. In addi-
tion to the investigation of human trafficking, the aim was to capture the entire organisation, 
including facilitators.127 The investigation therefore focused more on suspects (and accumu-
lating information) than on approaching victims, which exemplifies the risk of this strategy: 
if the police wait until the last moment to contact the victims there is the possibility that they 
will not cooperate with the investigation or cannot be found. The ban on not dealing with 
cases can also mean that the police have to intervene before they are ready to, without having 
gathered all the necessary evidence.
A feature of the offence-driven strategy is the so-called ‘article-27 aggregation’,128 which in-
volves the systematic gathering and collation of information that suggests that prostitutes 
are not working voluntarily or that there is a human trafficking situation. With this method, 
the police can focus on collecting missing information they still need for proper evidence. 
The police are also less dependent on the cooperation of victims for the investigation. In 
fact, almost all the victims were willing to make a complaint or a statement precisely be-
cause it became clear during the interviews how much the police already knew. Because of 
the structured organisation of the case and the accompanying construction of evidence, the 
investigation could be completed in a relatively short space of time and there seemed to be 
few risks attached to it.

Financial investigations
The police have not automatically conducted financial investigations in the context of hu-
man trafficking.129 However, greater attention is being devoted to financial investigations,130 
not only in connection with the confiscation of criminal earnings but also for the purpose of 
gathering evidence. One police force was able to identify the suspects in a human trafficking 
investigation by exposing the flows of criminal funds.131 This underlines the importance of 

127 And thus demonstrate the existence of a criminal organisation as well as human trafficking (Article 140 of 
the Dutch Criminal Code).

128 ‘Article 27 aggregation’ is a term derived from Article 27 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure, which 
states that a person can be regarded as a suspect if the facts and circumstances give rise to a reasonable sus-
picion of guilt of an offence. These facts and circumstances are assembled with this aggregation. See also 
NRM5.

financial investigations in human trafficking cases, especially in view of victims’ reluctance 
to press charges.NRM5

There are problems confiscating criminal earnings, and recovering the proceeds of crime 
can prove particularly difficult.132 Criminal earnings can also be taxed, but there are advan-
tage and drawbacks to this too.NRM5 In fact, the collection of tax by the tax authorities in 
other countries seems just as difficult as international cooperation in confiscation cases,133 
although the possibilities are often greater than believed.134 Changes in the law on confisca-
tion are pending (see §2.6).

Investigation techniques
The investigation of human trafficking is not always straightforward. A more general prob-
lem is that telephone taps are producing fewer and fewer results because criminals expect 
their calls to be intercepted.135 They often make calls via the internet, which are more difficult 
to tap. It is therefore important to look for alternatives, with respect to both crime in general 
and human trafficking. One instrument that has been used several times in recent years in 
investigations of human trafficking is the television programme Opsporing Verzocht. While 
it has not yet led to the resolution of any cases as far as is known, it has produced tips. There 
has also been one known case of a ‘pseudo purchase’. An operator of a brothel informed the 
police that some Romanians wanted to sell women to him to work in prostitution. By setting 
up a pseudo purchase, the suspects could be arrested. The police are of course constantly 
anticipating developments in the criminal sector in a general sense,136 which leads to new 
methods and techniques that can also enhance efforts to combat human trafficking. For ex-
ample, more undercover officers who can be used for more straightforward operations are 
being trained; as bartenders in bars frequented by suspected criminals, for instance.137 They 
could possibly also be used in the prostitution sector (if this is not already done).

Report of human trafficking
Another question that has to be addressed is what is needed to improve the quality of reports 
of human trafficking, in terms of the information they provide. Among other things, this 
calls for good, persistent questioning by the police and for every case to be treated seriously. 

132 BOOM now has asset tracers who track down hidden assets. See also Opportuun, volume 2008, number 
3, pp. 14-15. Nevertheless, BOOM’s director calls for more far-reaching measures. He feels, among other 
things, that the police forces should collect far more information about the income earned from criminal of-
fences and what happens to the money. (BOOM’s director in Het Financieele Dagblad, 24 January 2009).

But perhaps there are other factors that could persuade victims to provide more information. 
Victims are not always immediately able to tell their story in a clear, coherent and consistent 
fashion and do not always behave in the way a victim is expected to behave. Nonetheless, it 
is the task of the police to complete the story of human trafficking and to find the evidence 
to substantiate the story. It might be possible to use information possessed by the social 
services or representatives of victims for this purpose, information that could relate to the 
offence, as well as the physical and psychological condition of the victim (see also §5.3).

Other forms of exploitation
As mentioned in earlier reports, the entry into force of the expanded definition of the offence 
of human trafficking on 1 January 2005 prompted a discussion about the scope of the term 
‘exploitation’ in relation to work and services in sectors other than sex industry. The fact 
that the term needed to be further refined in legal practice made it difficult, at that time, for 
investigative services and the public prosecution service to gauge what situations the courts 
would regard as exploitation. Nevertheless, there have been investigations and prosecutions 
for human trafficking in response to abuses found in employment situations (see Chapter 
12). However, there is no comprehensive list of all the investigations of other forms of exploi-
tation carried out by the various police forces.

8.5  Shelved cases

For years there have been reports of human trafficking cases that have not been dealt with by 
police, known as ‘shelved cases’. The existence of ‘shelved human trafficking cases’ bears no 
relation to the priority given by the government, police, public prosecution service to human 
trafficking and the ban on not dealing with cases, which is one reason why the National Rap-
porteur on Trafficking in Human Beings has researched the subject further.
At the same time, there is no clear and precise definition of shelved cases, which complicates 
any discussion of the subject.138 For this study, therefore, we returned to the phase before a 
case is shelved, the stage when the police acquire information about human trafficking. We 
investigated how this information is dealt with, when an investigation comes to a halt (when 
the case is shelved) and why. We investigated whether there were any ‘shelved cases’ at the 
time of the study (the middle of 2008) and what types of cases they were. We also explored 
the organisation and implementation of efforts to combat human trafficking in the police 
regions. For practical reasons, eight police forces were selected for this study to reflect the 
variety of features and circumstances in different police regions (see the description of the 
study in Annex 2).

138 The Police Force Monitor 2007 reported 80 to 100 shelved cases in one police force, for example. This caused 
public uproar. Further enquiry showed that they were indications of human trafficking and not shelved cases 
as usually defined.

Types of shelved cases
The term ‘shelved cases’ generally refers to cases where there are indications that provide 
sufficient leads for an investigation but do not lead to any action or an actual investigation.139 
Shelved cases can arise at various times in the investigative process. In this study, the follow-
ing classification of shelved cases was made, from an organisational perspective, on the basis 
of the research material:
1.  Indications or complaints where it was decided (after consideration) that an investiga-

tion would start, but for which there was no capacity;
2.  Indications where it was decided that they should be sent to the regional ‘review com-

mittee’, but where the case was put aside for some time before being sent there;
3.  Indications that could be investigated without the intervention of a regional review com-

mittee (usually smaller cases), but where the case was left lying for some time before it 
was dealt with.

Existence of shelved cases
We investigated the extent to which the eight selected police regions had shelved cases in 
the above categories. At the time of the study, there were shelved cases of all three types in 
one police region; in two police regions there were none; in the other police regions, there 
were one or two types. This was a snapshot. The situation could be different at other times; 
respondents in some regions said that there were currently no shelved cases of a particular 
type but that at other times there were. The opposite situation also occurs.
An attempt was made to discover precisely how many shelved cases there were, but this 
proved impossible. Particularly where there were a number of shelved cases, it was not easy 
to discover how many there were. This study is therefore mainly concerned with the reasons 
why cases are shelved.

Reasons for shelving cases
The reason that cases are shelved is that they are not given priority and, hence, the resources 
to follow them up. Many respondents in the study said that, all things considered, the avail-
able capacity for investigating human trafficking is not in proportion to the priority given to 
it. This leads to cases being shelved at various levels in the police organisation. An unknown 
number of shelved cases are eventually abandoned because the offences cannot be prosecut-
ed due to lapse of time.
Human trafficking is not the only offence that is a priority for the police and public prosecu-
tion service, which are constantly confronted with more offences than they can deal with. 
Choices therefore have to be made. Although the police are immediately required to inves-
tigate every indication of human trafficking, in practice a human trafficking case may have 
to be dropped – at the review stage, for example – in favour of other priority cases (such as 
serious vice crimes or major drug cases) or it might take some time for a human trafficking 

139 Landman et al. (2007).

Investigation

323

investigation to start. One reason for this delay is that human trafficking cases have to be 
assigned to a team or department. Depending on the police force and the nature and scale 
of the investigation, human trafficking investigations are carried out by the district crime 
squad, the vice squad, the aliens police or the regional crime squad. Investigations can also 
be offered to the Supra-Regional or National Crime Squad. It takes some time to transfer an 
investigation, and meanwhile nothing is being done with the case.

When a human trafficking investigation is conducted by a different department (the district 
crime squad for example), that department might not possess sufficient knowledge and ex-
pertise in the field of human trafficking to recognise the importance of the investigation, and 
consequently, human trafficking investigations are sometimes given a lower priority than 
other investigations. The relevant departments sometimes also have problems with capacity. 
For example, it was said that there actually is not sufficient capacity to pursue human traf-
ficking cases in the districts.

In some regions, resources are reserved for human trafficking, usually in the form of a hu-
man trafficking team. Depending on the team’s size, staffing and tasks, this has a number 
of advantages. The team can collect, upgrade and analyse information about human traf-
ficking, which can lead to an investigation. These tasks do not necessarily have to be carried 
out by a human trafficking team in order to tackle human trafficking adequately, although 
the study shows that in regions without such a team, information about human trafficking 
is not always collected properly and it is, in practice, more difficult to run human trafficking 
investigations.
On the other hand, the existence of a human trafficking team provides no guarantee that an 
investigation will proceed smoothly. The team must have sufficient resources to perform 
both its administrative and tactical tasks (unless the administrative or tactical tasks are as-
signed elsewhere in the force). Furthermore, detectives are sometimes removed from an in-
vestigation (to deal with serious offences or major public events, for example),140 which can 
be at the expense of human trafficking investigations.

Five of the eight police regions indicated that a lot of resources are devoted to investigating 
cases with practically no leads. In that context, they specifically refer to cases to which the B9 
regulation applies. These involve individuals who are living illegally in the Netherlands and 
say they are victims of human trafficking. In many of these cases an extensive investigation 
is carried out even though there are almost no leads. These investigations ultimately lead 
nowhere and the cases are abandoned.

In some police regions, information about other forms of exploitation is handled by a sep-
arate part of the organisation. In other regions, a single department handles information 
about both sexual and other forms of exploitation. In the study, it was not possible in either 
case to discover what specific shelved cases there were in the area of other forms of exploita-

140 Murders and football matches are mentioned in this context.

324

tion. The study showed that police efforts to deal with other forms of exploitation are still 
evolving, and the absence of shelved cases does not necessarily mean that the force has its 
affairs in order.
A police force does not decide to shelve a case when there are gaps in the collection and 
analysis of information about human trafficking. In most of the police regions that were in-
vestigated – including those with shelved cases – the information side of things was, in any 
case, well organised.

8.6  International developments

Police cooperation with forces in other countries is becoming increasingly important.141 Not 
much is known about this subject, however; little scientific research has been done on it.142 
There are also several problems, such as differences in legal systems and interests. This dis-
cussion of international cooperation focuses on investigations led by international intelli-
gence, improvements in the exchange of information143 and operational cooperation, in the 
form, for example, of Joint Investigation Teams (JIT).144 This section outlines some develop-
ments in the cooperation between police forces in human trafficking cases.

Operational cooperation
A number of larger Dutch investigations of human trafficking involved substantial opera-
tional cooperation between countries, but the Koolvis investigation crowns them all. In that 
investigation, the Dutch police cooperated not only with other European countries and the 
United States, but also with the traffickers’ and victims’ country of origin, Nigeria.145 The 
operation culminated in arrests in the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, France, 
Germany, Italy, the United States and in Nigeria itself. Building on this, preparations were 
made for a bilateral project to provide assistance to the Nigerian agency for combating hu-
man trafficking (NAPTIP), which is regarded as a reliable partner in a country where there 

141 In 2007, for example, the police formulated a number of important aims in terms of further professionalising 
and intensifying international cooperation. These ambitions are laid down in the document ‘De normaal-
ste zaak van de wereld. Visie op de internationalisering van de Nederlandse politie’. The formation of the 
International Police Cooperation Service (Dinpol) by the National Police Agency (KLPD) also makes clear 
the police’s international ambitions. See also the Programme to Strengthen the Approach to Combating 
Organised Crime (annex to Parliamentary Documents II 2007/08, 29 911, no. 10). The Reference Framework 
for Human Trafficking calls for forces to actively seek international cooperation.

144 Joint Investigation Teams (JIT) are made up of members from two or more EU member states and who con-

duct criminal investigations in one or more of the member states. Preparations were made earlier to form 
a JIT for human trafficking, but it never started (see NRM5). A JIT for human trafficking did operate in the 
Meuse-Rhine Euroregion (see later in this section). The current JITs focus mainly on terrorism and drug 
trafficking. (Source: Gualtieri, 2007). See also Rijken (2006, pp. 99-118).

is a lot of corruption146 and to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of human traf-
ficking in Nigeria. Following lengthy preparations, the project started on 1 July 2009 and will 
involve a series of intensive training courses for NAPTIP staff and employees of a number of 
other Nigerian agencies (particularly the Nigeria Immigration Service).147

There has also been investment in cooperation with Romania and Bulgaria, two other im-
portant countries of origin of victims of human trafficking.148 Assistance has been provided 
to ANITP, the Romanian anti-human trafficking agency. Such investments are partly intend-
ed to improve the supply of information to the Netherlands. The Dutch embassy in Romania 
is also supporting a project to promote the prevention of human trafficking through edu-
cational theatre. In Bulgaria, a National Referral Mechanism for the protection and support 
of victims of human trafficking is being developed and a specialist unit (also known as the 
‘Bulgarian EMM’) is also being set up with Dutch support within the Bulgarian Ministry of 
Home Affairs, which will focus on tackling human trafficking. In addition, the Netherlands 
is supporting a publicity campaign in secondary schools and the establishment of new shel-
ters for victims. The police forces in Groningen and Friesland are running a pilot project 
targeted at human trafficking from Bulgaria (see §7.6.1), which will involve exchanges of Bul-
garian and Dutch police officers.
There are also partnerships, in place or planned, with Hungary, India, China, Ukraine and 
the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba (see also Chapter 1 for the last two countries) that en-
compass human trafficking. Memorandums of Understanding have been concluded with sev-
eral of these countries.

Rapid Action Teams
As a pilot project, so-called rapid action teams were formed in Nigeria in the first quarter 
of 2008. These teams, consisting of officers from the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee and 
the IND, check whether passengers travelling to the Netherlands might be victims of human 
trafficking. Although the teams discovered no possible victims on the flights inspected dur-
ing the pilot project, the evaluation of the project concluded that the teams seemed to have 
had a preventive effect (although it cannot be ruled out that this effect is attributable to the 
elimination of a Nigerian human trafficking network just before the pilot project started (in 
the Koolvis case, see §9.5.5). On the basis of the evaluation, it was decided that the rapid ac-
tion teams would, in future, be used if migration problems gave cause to do so.149 There are 
no plans to deploy rapid action teams for the time being. Social workers are less happy with 
the approach, partly because it does not provide a structural solution and victims could be 
transported at later time or by another route.150

Europol
Every year Europol151 publishes the annual EU Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), 
in which it outlines the current and anticipated future developments in organised crime in 
the European Union. Among other things, the OCTA serves as a basis for establishing the 
EU’s priorities for action against organised crime. The OCTA and Europol’s other reports 
also review developments with respect to human trafficking (see §9.4). The Netherlands is 
concerned about the quality of the OCTA:152 there is room for improvement in the analyses 
provided by the member states, for example.
Europol has also created Analytical Work Files (AWFs) for the purposes of information ex-
change, and an AWF has been opened for human trafficking.153 The United Kingdom and 
Romania have formed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) for human trafficking. The Nether-
lands and Germany might also establish one.
It is not necessary for all 25 EU member states to be involved in European police coopera-
tion. The Comprehensive Operational Strategic Plan for Police (COSPOL) programme is 
an example of cooperation involving only those countries that have a specific interest in it. 
Member states can sign up for different domains (related to offences or groups of offenders), 
which produces combinations of countries that are struggling with the same problem and 
therefore have a specific interest in cooperation. These groups receive support from analysts 
and other experts at Europol. There is currently a COSPOL project for human trafficking, 
led by Austria and Romania. Austria, the driver of this cluster, has meanwhile officially ended 
the cluster in its current form.154

Because Europol’s initiatives to promote cooperation have traditionally suffered badly from 
the lack of trust between the member states, the sharing of information through Europol is 
not optimal. The member states will have to serve Europol better in the coming period, so 
that it can meet expectations.155 The Netherlands has said that it wants to make more inten-
sive use of the opportunities offered by Europol.

Cross-border police cooperation in the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion
The police forces of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany have been cooperating in the 
Meuse-Rhine Euroregion since 1969.156 In 2008, the partnership made human trafficking 
one of its three priorities.157 This led to the sharing of information and the formation of a 
JIT with Belgium. The JIT investigated a case in which women from Kyrgyzstan were trans-

151 Europol does not have authority for its own investigations, but helps member states to share information 
and can provide experts and technical resources for international teams of investigators.

ported to the Netherlands and Belgium to work in prostitution there. The JIT was successful: 
the perpetrators were arrested and convicted. Human trafficking was no longer a priority for 
the region in 2009, but information is still exchanged about common problems in the area 
of human trafficking.
The Euroregional Police Information Cooperation Centre (EPICC) was established in 2005 
for the purposes of sharing information. Police officers from the three countries work to-
gether at the centre and have access to information about investigations in their own coun-
tries. The information can therefore be shared very quickly.158 There is one person in EPICC 
whose main focus area is human trafficking and migrant smuggling, and this person also 
maintains contact with EMM.159

Capital Policing Europe
At the annual meeting of the chief constables of the European capitals (Capital Policing Eu-
rope) in 2008, subjects discussed included developments that undermine political, social and 
economic order and integrity, as well as the importance of analysing and exchanging infor-
mation in tackling these issues. The closing declaration expressly mentioned human traffick-
ing as an important aspect of that “undermining” and stated that a more adequate exchange 
of information about human trafficking, for example, would have substantial benefits.160 The 
agenda for the next meeting in 2009 included ‘intelligence led policing and the sharing of 
information with other agencies in tackling crime, such as human trafficking’.161

8.7 Conclusions

This section contains an overview of the problems and points requiring attention in the in-
vestigation of human trafficking as discussed in this chapter and that also emerged from 
information presented earlier.

Policy and organisation
In practice, police forces do not all give the necessary priority to human trafficking. The Ref-
erence Framework on Human Trafficking (2008) published by the police’s National Human 
Trafficking Expert Group (LEM) contains useful guidelines for the police in how to handle 
human-trafficking cases and it is highly recommended that all forces adopt these guidelines. 
However, it is unclear whether and how the forces can be obliged to do so. This subject may 
be addressed in the next Police Force Monitor on Prostitution and Trafficking in Human 
Beings (2009/2010).

158 The necessary information is always given immediately. In certain cases they are later advised to submit a 
request for legal assistance.

The various forces share information about their strategies and policies in the LEM, but since 
2007, meetings of the LEM have not been attended by experts from all the forces; only by a se-
lect few have attended, and this alternately with and without external partners. As a result, the 
LEM is in danger of losing its usefulness in prompting and motivating police forces.

Identification and investigation
It is often difficult to identify victims of human trafficking per se. It is, in any case, important 
for any visible signs of human trafficking to be spotted. While it is quite possible that this 
does not always happen, it is unclear on what scale. To identify signs of human trafficking 
properly it is important that both members of the public and employees in every level of 
organisations that might be confronted with human trafficking (including the police) know 
what it involves, can recognise victims and know how to act on a suspicion of human traf-
ficking. That situation has not yet been reached. There is still room for improvement in the 
capacity of various agencies, including municipalities, the IND, chambers of commerce, the 
police, doctors, operators of sex establishments, social workers and others to identify signs 
of human trafficking.
There are many different manifestations of human trafficking (including sexual exploitation, 
non-sexual exploitation and the loverboy problem). Each of them requires, partially at least, 
a different approach. Efforts to address human trafficking outside the sex industry in par-
ticular are still in their infancy and call, in some cases, for a change of attitude on the part of 
the relevant organisations (aliens police, the IND and the Ministry of Justice’s Repatriation 
and Departure Service (DT&V)). It is still not universally accepted that very serious forms 
of human trafficking can also occur in sectors outside the sex industry and that just as much 
priority should be devoted to identifying and investigating them. The police forces constant-
ly have to make choices in establishing priorities. The decision on where to deploy capacity 
is not always made in favour of tackling human trafficking. The administrative supervision 
of the prostitution industry also requires manpower and is not always – as has been agreed 
– facilitated by municipalities. The result is that some warnings of human trafficking are not 
investigated and investigations are dropped.
Many police forces have formed specialist teams to investigate human trafficking, but other 
divisions (such as the regional criminal investigation teams) also conduct investigations. It is 
evident that they sometimes lack knowledge and expertise of human trafficking. In regions 
without a specialist human-trafficking team, information about human trafficking is not al-
ways gathered properly and investigations seem to be more difficult to conduct. Detectives 
trained in dealing with human-trafficking cases are not always available to hear complaints.
It is not only identifying victims of human trafficking that is difficult, but also securing their 
cooperation with investigations and prosecutions. Victims are unwilling to report offences 
and their reports sometimes contain very few leads for an investigation. For successful inves-
tigations it is also important to use alternative solutions and strategies, such as accumulating 
evidence from other sources. As stated in the Instructions on Human Trafficking, all investi-
gating teams should include detectives specialising in financial crime.

Investigation

329

Human trafficking is always a local phenomenon but is frequently organised by international 
gangs. Cooperation with the police in other countries is therefore vital but little is known about 
this. There are also problems with international cooperation, for example because of differ-
ences in legal systems and interests. International cooperation is also very time-consuming.

Information and follow up
It is important for the investigation of human trafficking to make use of information avail-
able to other partners in the chain, although naturally the provisions of the Personal Data 
Protection Act have to be observed. Nevertheless, the sharing of information seems to raise 
various obstacles for investigations into human trafficking. Some of these barriers are tech-
nical in nature and relate, for example, to computer systems. But others can be traced to at-
titudes. These obstacles must be removed as far as possible in view of the importance of the 
information and the need to share it.
The EMM acts as the national repository of information about human trafficking provided 
by all of the agencies involved in the supervision, control and investigation of human traf-
ficking and in providing assistance to victims, but it does not function satisfactorily. On the 
one hand, not all of the information is supplied, and on the other, the information that is 
available is not properly analysed and processed. The disappointing output then undermines 
any motivation to provide information. The Human Trafficking Task Force commissioned a 
study into the exchange of information between police forces and the EMM. The resulting 
report, ‘Trade; you’ll pay for this’, led to the decision to start a pilot project with the Regional 
Information and Expertise Centres (RIECs) in Rotterdam and Groningen designed to im-
prove the flow of information between the RIECs and the EMM.

The importance of the exchange of information between international police forces is grow-
ing all the time. By merging and analysing operational information from different countries 
it is possible to learn more about the methods used by human traffickers and how they can 
be tackled. In the EU this is a task for Europol but the exchange of information through Eu-
ropol is not optimal. The Netherlands can play its part by adhering to the agreements on the 
provision of information to Europol.

Victims
The police naturally have a duty of care towards any victims of human trafficking they en-
counter during investigations. The victims must be given shelter, but a practical problem 
facing the police is the shortage of places in suitable shelters and the occasional difficulty in 
reaching the relevant aid agencies. The police are also required to clearly inform victims of 
their options and their rights and to give them the opportunity to report an offence. There 
are quite a few indications that victims who wish to report an offence are not always given 
the opportunity to do so by the police and that victims are not kept properly informed of 
progress with the police investigation.

Suspects and offenders

9.1 Introduction

This chapter contains statistics about suspects – persons whose case is registered with the 
public prosecution service (PPS) – and persons convicted for human trafficking in first in-
stance. The chapter opens with data from the PPS about the age, country of origin and gender 
of offenders over the period 2003-2007 (§9.2). The following section (§9.3) presents some of 
the findings from the BNRM’s study into human-trafficking case law in 2007. Section §9.4 
then discusses the methods used by human traffickers, with §9.5 focusing specifically on the 
Nigerian method, including a discussion of the Koolvis Case.

The individual sections of this chapter do not all relate to the same forms of exploitation. 
The statistics in the study of case law in Chapter 11, for example, only cover cases of sexual 
exploitation, and sections 9.4 and 9.5 are also primarily about the methods used by human 
traffickers involved in sexual exploitation. However, the PPS’s data contain information 
about exploitation outside the sex industry (‘other forms of exploitation’) as well as sexual 
exploitation.

Because, for practical reasons,1 no detailed figures are available for 2008, Table 9.1 presents 
a summary of key data for 2008, supplemented with data from previous years. The numbers 
and percentages in Table 9.1 differ slightly from the data in the other tables in this chapter. In 
so far as the information in the other tables is also taken from PPS data, this difference is ex-
plained mainly by the dynamic nature of the PPS’s database and the different reference dates 
used in Table 9.1 and in the other tables in §9.2. The differences between the PPS’s data and 
the statistics from the BNRM’s survey of case law in Chapter 11 are explained by differences 
in the selection criteria on which the analyses are based.
Although the data are presented jointly in Table 9.1, it is not a cohort analysis.

1 More extensive details for 2008 will be published on the BNRM website as soon as the data are available.

Table 9.1 shows that the absolute number of convictions for human trafficking in first instance 
rose from 73 in 2007 to 79 in 2008. It also shows that fewer human trafficking cases were reg-
istered by the PPS in 2008 compared with the record year of 2007 (215 compared with 281). 
These data (the number of registered cases in one year and the number of convictions in that 
same year) can not show a possible relative (in terms of percentage) development in regard to 
the number of convictions. This because a judgement in first instance usually does not pass 
in the same year as that the case was registered by the PPS. Also, not all the registered cases 
eventually will pass a judgement in first instance. Some cases are dealt with by the public 
prosecution in an other way (like an unconditional decision not to prosecute etc.).
Twelve minors were suspects in 2008. This figure was higher than in previous years, as was 
the number of minors (4) who were convicted offenders. This increase must be monitored, 
since a different preventive approach may be needed if it represents a trend.

9.2 Information from public prosecution service data

This section provides statistics about specific features (age, gender and country of origin) 
of suspects and persons convicted of human trafficking. The information in the tables is 
taken from PPS data and encompasses cases of both sexual exploitation and other forms of 
exploitation.

9.2.1  Age

Age of suspects
Table 9.2 presents an overview of the ages of suspects registered by the PPS, broken down 
by age group.

2 These are two cases fewer than reported in NRM6. These are two offences committed in 2005, which were 
originally but are now no longer registered as human trafficking cases.

3 This figure differs from the other tables in this chapter. This is probably connected with corrections made to 
the PPS’s data between the different reference dates. Table 9.1 contains more recent data.

In more than 80% of the cases registered in 2007, the age of the suspects at the time of the 
first human trafficking offence8 was between 18 and 41. The average age was 319 and seven 
minors were suspects (2%), which is fewer than in 2006.
Over the entire period from 2003 to 2007, the average age of the suspects was 3210 (the aver-
age age was 32 for men11 and 31 for women12).

4 This is not equal to the sum of the individual percentages in this column, because the individual percentages 
were rounded off.

5 There are two fewer cases than mentioned in the sixth report of the NRM. These are two offences commit-
ted in 2005, which were originally but are now no longer registered as human trafficking cases.

Age of convicted offenders
Table 9.3 contains similar information about the age at the time of the offence, of offenders 
convicted of human trafficking in first instance in the period between 2003 and 2007. It is 
important to note here that the year of registration by the PPS is not always the year in which 
the court rendered judgment. The lists for each year therefore do not contain precisely the 
same registered persons as convicted persons.

As in the previous year, around 80% of the offenders convicted of human trafficking in 2007 
were aged between 18 and 41 at the time of the first human trafficking offence. The average 
age was 29.18 In 2007, three of the convicted offenders (4%) were minors at the time of the of-
fence.19 Over the entire period from 2003 to 2007, the average age of the convicted offenders 
(at the time of the first human trafficking offence in the relevant case) was 31.20

13 There are again minor differences between the numbers mentioned in this report and those in previous re-
ports, probably due to corrections made in the PPS’s data after the reference dates used in the earlier reports. 
Because the differences are small, they are not discussed here in further detail.

9.2.2 Country of origin

Country of origin of suspects
Suspects came from 59 different countries over the period from 2003 to 2007, and in each 
year during that period, there were suspects from between 20 and more than 30 different 
countries. The largest number of different countries of origin of suspects in a single year 
was 35 in 2007.

Table 9.4 ranks the five most common countries of birth of suspects in each year.21 An ‘apos-
trophe’ shows that more than one country shares that place in the rankings.

See Annex 4 (Table B5) for a complete list.

21 The most recent year (2007) determines the order in which the countries are listed.

entire period from 2003 to 2007, came from the country concerned.

As in previous years, the Netherlands was the most common country of birth of suspects 
registered by the PPS in 2007.25 The increase in the number and proportion of suspects from 
Bulgaria, Nigeria, Turkey and the Netherlands Antilles is also noteworthy. Although Table 
9.4 shows that the position of several countries in the top five was relatively stable, there are 
also striking differences in the frequency with which some countries of origin appear in each 

23 The suspects of the two offences committed in 2005 – mentioned in an earlier footnote – which originally 
were but now are not registered as human trafficking offences, were born in the Netherlands. This is why the 
number of Dutch suspects in 2006 is two less than reported in NRM6.

24 Three cases (one in 2003, one in 2004 and one in 2006) involved legal entities.

year’s list. Whereas the sixth report of the NRM said that Albania’s significance seemed to 
have disappeared in this respect and Nigeria’s seemed to be declining, there were still five 
suspects from Albania in 2007 and the proportion of Nigerian suspects grew strongly in 
2007.26

The previous table was concerned with the countries of birth of suspects of human traf-
ficking registered by the PPS. Table 9.6 ranks the five most common countries of birth of 
persons convicted of human trafficking in each of the years from 2003 to 2007.27

the stable position of several countries in the top five, there are some striking differences 
in terms of the number of convicted offenders from some countries of origin in each year. 
Whereas the sixth report of the NRM said that the number of Bulgarians, Romanians and 
Turks that were convicted seemed to be falling, a substantial proportion of offenders con-
victed in 2007 (18%) came from Romania, and that percentage was higher than in the two 
previous years.

9.2.3 Gender

Gender of suspects
Most suspects are men: 82% in 2007. The 46 female suspects registered by the PPS in that 
year came from the Netherlands (13), Nigeria (8), Bulgaria (7), Poland (4), Thailand (3), Ro-
mania (2) and France, Ghana, Cameroon, Morocco, Netherlands Antilles, Somalia and Tur-
key (one each). The country of origin of two female suspects is not known.
There are significant differences between the countries of origin in this regard. Referring 
only to Table 9.4, with the rankings of the most common countries of origin of suspects, it is 
noticeable that there are few women (3%) among the Turkish suspects and many among the 
Nigerian (42%) and Bulgarian (30%) suspects. The Netherlands (14%) and Romania (13%) 
fall between those two extremes.

Gender of convicted offenders
Looking at convictions for human trafficking, 12 of the 73 persons convicted (in first instance) 
in 2009 were women, representing 16%.30 They came from the Netherlands (4), Romania (3) 
and Brazil, Hungary, India, Lithuania and (former) Czechoslovakia (one each).

9.3 Information from the BNRM’s investigation of case law

The BNRM studied the case law on exploitation in the sex industry in the Netherlands and 
analysed all the judgments in first instance in 2007. The study covered a total of 108 judg-
ments in 65 separate human trafficking cases involving a minimum of one and a maximum 
of seven suspects and a total of 108 defendants. In contrast to the data from the PPS, the 
study only covered cases involving human trafficking for sexual exploitation; it ignored cas-
es involving others forms of exploitation.31 This section describes a number of the findings 
made with regard to suspects and convicted offenders from the judgments investigated in 
this study.

30 The gender of one convicted person is not known. The number of convictions of women for human traffick-
ing was 13 in 2003 (16%), 21 in 2004 (18%), 10 in 2005 (12%) and 13 in 2006 (19%).

31 See §11.2 for an explanation of the methodology of this study and a further explanation of the very minor dif-
ferences between the figures in this study and the PPS’s figures. See Annex 2 for an explanation of the study. 
For the study of the case law on other forms of exploitation, see § 12.6.

9.3.1  Personal characteristics

Table 9.8 briefly describes some of the personal characteristics of the suspects32 and con-
victed persons33 in the cases studied.

Other 73 67% 87 72%

Most suspects and convicted offenders are men and almost all suspects and convicted of-
fenders are adults. Roughly two-thirds of the suspects were not born in the Netherlands; the 
percentage is slightly higher for convicted offenders. It should be noted here that the Neth-
erlands is, nevertheless, the most common country of birth of both suspects and convicted 
offenders.

9.3.2 Specific characteristics

Table 9.9 shows whether the suspects and convicted offenders were in detention at the time 
of the trial, whether they had confessed or made a partial confession to the human traffick-
ing offences they were charged with and whether they knew any of their victims prior to the 
human trafficking offences they (were alleged to have) committed.

32 The suspects only include the persons in whose human trafficking cases a judgment was rendered in 2007 
(conviction or acquittal), and therefore do not include everyone whose case was registered by the PPS in 
2007.

33 The convicted offenders only include those persons who were at least convicted of human trafficking in 
2007. Accordingly, the persons who were acquitted of human trafficking, but at the same time convicted of 
another offence, are not covered.

The majority of the suspects were in custody at the time of their trial in the Netherlands. 
However, it is noteworthy that more than a third was not in detention, despite being suspect-
ed of the serious offence of human trafficking. In other words, almost a third of the convicted 
offenders were not in custody, although they were ultimately convicted and almost always 
sentenced to unconditional prison sentences39 for offences including human trafficking. For 
example, in one case, the sentence demanded and handed down was 12 years in prison for 
offences including human trafficking, while the suspect was not in detention at the time of 
the trial.40 Insofar as it is specifically reported in the judgments, the suspects and convict-
ed offenders rarely made a (partial) confession. The suspects usually admitted performing 
certain actions that are essential for the offence of human trafficking, such as transporting 
victims to and from the workplace, but denied that the victims had acted involuntarily. An 
example of a partial confession by a suspect illustrates this.

36 N = 108.
37 N = 74.
38 Table 10.6 contains data about preventive detention taken from the PPS’s database. However, the figures in 

the two tables cannot be compared because the BNRM’s study of the case law is based on cases of sexual 
exploitation in which judgement was rendered in first instance in 2007, while Table 10.6 includes all human 
trafficking cases (including cases of other forms of exploitation) that were registered by the PPS in 2007. It is 
not known how many of these registered cases were also handled by the courts in 2007. Furthermore, Table 
10.6 covers cases in which there was preventive custody, whereas the BNRM case-law study was concerned 
with whether the suspects were still in conditional detention at the time of the trial, since in some cases 
custody is lifted before the first day of the trial so that the suspect is no longer in detention at the time of the 
trial. The consequence of this is that these suspects are registered in the public prosecution’s data under the 
heading ‘preventive custody’ and in the BNRM’s case-law study under ‘not detained at the time of the trial’. 

39 See §11.9.

years and 11 months by the Arnhem appeal court (judgment not published).

‘The suspect also admitted that he had repeatedly arranged for women to come from Bra-
zil to work for him by providing money and/or tickets and that, when these women arrived 
in the Netherlands and were working for the suspect, he adopted certain rules restricting 
their freedom, which these women had to follow. They included confiscating and/or with-
holding their passports, requiring them to work seven days a week, forbidding them to have 
mobile telephones, forbidding them to go out unaccompanied and forbidding them to form 
friendships.’41

Almost a quarter of the suspects and a fifth of the convicted offenders knew at least one of 
their victims before the human trafficking offence they (were alleged to have) committed. 
These were often family members, but also friends or even current or former partners.

9.3.3 Role of convicted offenders

Table 9.10 shows the role of the convicted offenders in the human trafficking process. The 
various categories are not mutually exclusive, since offenders regularly perform various 
roles.

of victims with a view to exploitation in fact constitutes the full offence of human trafficking (in accordance 
with Article 273f section 1 under 1 of the Dutch Criminal Code.). However, in practice, judges regularly treat 
it as ‘being an accessory to human trafficking’. See §11.6.2.

Almost three-quarters of the convicted offenders performed the role of pimp. Half were in-
volved in recruiting victims and 35% brought victims to the Netherlands from another coun-
try. Roughly a quarter had to guard the victims and slightly less than a fifth were responsible 
for transporting victims to and from the workplace. A minority of the convicted persons 
(5%) were operators of a sex business, but it is unknown whether those sex businesses were 
licensed, unlicensed or illegal.

9.4 Human traffickers and their methods

Although countries of origin and other aspects of the backgrounds of suspects and victims 
vary, there are similarities in the methods used by different human trafficking organisations. 
This section explains the methods used by human traffickers involved in the sexual exploita-
tion of women, including (1) the different stages of the human trafficking process, (2) the 
organisational structure of human trafficking groups and (3) the methods used by different 
human traffickers. The section then discusses how the legitimate world is interwoven with 
the criminal milieu and describes the role of the internet and of female offenders.

9.4.1 A human trafficking process

Recruitment
The human trafficking process almost always starts with recruitment, also regarded as the 
press-ganging, hiring or kidnapping of victims.49 According to Spapens and Fijnaut, there 
are, in practice, four distinct types of recruitment. A first variant involves women who vol-
untarily come to Western Europe to earn money in prostitution, without any question of 
being deceived or coerced. Even in these situations, however, the recruiter is guilty of an of-
fence since the text of Article 273, section 1 under 3 of the Dutch Criminal Code states that 
recruiting a person with the intention of bringing them into prostitution in another country 
is an offence, even without coercion or evidence that the method of recruitment curtailed the 
victim’s freedom of choice.50

In a second variant, women are recruited under false pretences. They do not know that they 
will have to work in prostitution and, in fact, believe they will be working as dancers, domes-
tic servants, nannies or in the hospitality industry, for example. On arrival the women are 
forced into prostitution with threats or claims of so-called debts.
The third variant differs from the second in that not only threats, but also physical violence, 
rape and drugs are used to force the woman into prostitution. The last distinct category is 
the classical loverboy method, as described in detail in NRM3.51

Transport
The women who are recruited make the journey to the country of destination in various 
ways, including by train, international bus service or plane. There are also indications that 
taxi drivers are used to transport women to the country of destination by car.52 Victims are 
often advanced the travel costs by the trafficker, so that on arrival in the country of destina-
tion they have a debt, which can be used to put pressure on them to work as prostitutes. 
Victims who need a visa to travel to Western Europe use false visas and travel documents. 
Companies established in a Schengen country, for which the women are told they will be 
working, are often used for the purposes of visa fraud.53

Accommodation
Victims of transnational human trafficking must be taken somewhere to stay on their ar-
rival in the country of destination. Leman & Janssens investigated the use of safe houses54 
by eight large human trafficking and human smuggling networks on the basis of cases in the 
period from 1995 to 2005.55 These networks were engaged in human trafficking and smug-
gling from Eastern Europe to the Netherlands and Belgium.
The use of safe houses is particularly common among Chinese smuggling networks, but in 
contrast to criminal organisations that engage in human smuggling, networks of human traf-
fickers use houses as permanent accommodation. Leman & Janssens’ investigation revealed 
that networks engaged in human trafficking for sexual exploitation use houses not only in 
the country of destination, but also have places where they can keep victims during the jour-
ney – or even for use as assembly points in the country of origin prior to transport. In the 
country of destination women remain under the control of the traffickers, either because 
they live with a trafficker or a female accomplice or because the dwelling is in the immediate 
vicinity of the workplace (sex establishment). The accommodation is often designed to re-
strict their freedom of movement. Traffickers control the women by forbidding them to leave 
the house or even locking them up.56

Putting women to work in prostitution
On arrival in the country of destination a human trafficker will persuade or compel the vic-
tim to become a prostitute. A human trafficker can use various means of coercion and vic-
tims can also be forced to work in different sectors of prostitution.NRM3 On the basis of infor-
mation from the German police, Spapens and Fijnaut concluded that there had been a shift 
from prostitution in windows and clubs to less visible venues such as hotels, private homes 

52 Brummelkamp (2008).
53 Spapens & Fijnaut (2005, pp. 196-197).
54 The term safe house has a totally different connotation here to when it is used in the Dutch policy context. 

By safe house here is meant a dwelling used to house and control victims. The other meaning of safe house 
is a location where various agencies cooperate in effort to tackle crime and nuisance (Government Policy 
Programme, 2008; Ministry of Justice et al., 2008).

and escort services, where criminals can maintain even tighter control over the women.57 For 
more information on the shifts occurring in the prostitution sector, see Chapter 7.

9.4.2 Human traffickers and organisational structures

Human traffickers are difficult to categorise. They range from diplomats and employees of 
multinationals to large criminal organisations dedicated to human trafficking.58 Human traf-
ficking is committed by individual criminals as well as by groups.
Human traffickers also differ in terms of their ethnic and religious background and often col-
laborate in different continents, even in combinations that would seldom occur in legitimate 
companies.59

The personality of a human trafficker is seldom investigated. The only research in this field is a 
recent study carried out at the EMM for a thesis. This study explored some features of the per-
sonalities of nine suspects in investigations that were used in the Human Trafficking chapter of 
the Crime Analysis (CBA) 2007. Victims, detectives and an independent researcher evaluated 
the personalities of the nine suspects using the Five Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI) and 
Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R). The study concluded that the suspects they studied 
scored poorly on altruism and orderliness, but differed little from the non-criminal popula-
tion in terms of extraversion, neuroticism and openness. It is noteworthy that a relatively high 
percentage (33%) of the offenders could be described as psychopaths, compared with 1% of the 
non-criminal population, according to the study. No general conclusions about the personality 
of human traffickers can be drawn from this study, since the research group was very small and 
there are re-servations about how representative it was.60

There are three types of organisational structures in human trafficking.NRM3 Besides indi-
viduals who operate independently (sometimes with an associate) and isolated criminal 
gangs with between two and five members who run the entire human trafficking operation, 
the third report of the NRM described the criminal network, which usually consists of far 
more than six persons. These networks are often made up of separate clusters, linked by 
intermediaries.NRM3 A distinction can be made in the category of organised groups between 
traditional criminal organisations, such as the Italian mafia or the Japanese yakuza, criminal 
groups that are involved in a wide range of activities and organisations whose members have 
ethnic links and businesses, such as transport companies and travel agencies, that are run by 
criminals.61

Although criminal organisations are often thought to have a hierarchical structure, there is a 
growing realisation that many criminal gangs form networks, with small groups cooperating

with each other in a flexible manner. Every link in the network can also be easily replaced, 
so crime consortia are dynamic in nature and encounter few problems if individual links 
are removed.62 According to Williams, a network is more concerned with achieving its goals 
quickly and efficiently than with its organisational structure.
Earlier Organised Crime Monitors63 showed that criminal partnerships are usually formed 
through social relationships, such as family ties and friendships. These relationships not 
only constitute the cement binding the members of the criminal organisation together, they 
also form a bridge between criminal groups in different countries. Staring studied four hu-
man trafficking cases and also observed a strong social bond between the key members of 
crime consortia engaged in human trafficking. His study provided indications that the key 
members of the network were not only connected through family ties, but usually also had 
the same country of origin. Both social and geographical proximity seem decisive for the 
creation of alliances between human traffickers.64

Staring also assessed the relationships within criminal organisations engaged in human traf-
ficking on the basis of the dimensions of coordination and dominance. Coordination refers 
to the horizontal differentiation within the organisation, one indication of which is the ex-
tent to which tasks are divided among the members. Dominance refers to the vertical differ-
entiation in criminal gangs, such as the division of power among the members of the group, 
as well as the use of power against victims.65 In contrast to the conclusion of the Organised 
Crime Monitor, Staring found that there is a certain degree of hierarchy in criminal organi-
sations engaged in human trafficking. They are, in any case, more hierarchical than networks 
of human smugglers.66 According to Europol, the criminal organisations and networks in-
volved in human trafficking include hierarchical networks as well as groups and individuals 
that work on the basis of personal contacts and small groups with a specific assignment.67

9.4.3  Methods

Human traffickers employ various methods to force women into prostitution. Authors use 
typical idealised models of human trafficking networks to describe the methods of different 
groups of human traffickers. Although such a classification can be used to categorise traf-
ficking in human beings, it does not apply to every criminal group. This section describes the 
methods and types of human traffickers on the basis of a number of these models: Shelley’s 
classification in terms of business models68 and the reference models of traffickers produced 
by Becucci on the basis of a study of the situation in Italy.69

Based on the principal countries of origin of victims, suspects and convicted persons, the 
East European models, the Chinese and the Nigerian model are particularly relevant for the 
Dutch situation. Also, the loverboy method is often mentioned in the context of human traf-
ficking in the Netherlands. The methods used by these specific human trafficking organisa-
tions are explained below.

One problem in describing their methods is that human traffickers are quick to change the 
way they operate. A method is often outdated by the time it is discovered. The method used 
by loverboys is a particularly good example of that.
An understanding of the changes in the methods used is, however, very important in order 
to respond in the measures taken to tackle human trafficking. Police investigations are an 
important source of information about the methods of human traffickers. Until 2005, the 
BNRM kept a record of the number of successful investigations in the preceding year and 
reported on features of these cases every year. Because the police themselves were instructed 
to produce a Crime Monitoring Analysis (CBA) for the six priority areas in organised crime 
(including human trafficking), the BNRM decided to stop doing this.NRM5 It is now clear that 
in a number of aspects that are important for BNRM the information in the CBAs differ 
from the information yielded by its own surveys. For instance, a CBA does not cover every 
investigation of human trafficking but is based on a selection of investigations in a particular 
period. CBAs are also not public information and the NRM’s reports therefore cannot refer 
to information in them. Complete and detailed information from the investigations is sorely 
lacking. The BNRM therefore intends to resume these studies next year.

The loverboy method
Loverboys70 are human traffickers. The term loverboys is traditionally used to refer to young 
men who use seduction techniques to charm young Dutch girls with the ultimate aim of 
exploiting them in prostitution. Characteristic elements of many of the descriptions of the 
loverboy method are the use of seduction techniques and the fact that loverboys operate 
alone.NRM3 Bovenkerk et al. describe loverboys as “an exceptional form of pimping: they use 
their love affair with a woman to bring her into prostitution and exploit her”.71

Because of the rapid changes in the techniques used and the type of person that applies the 
loverboy method, descriptions of a loverboy or the loverboy method are quickly outdated. 
Classical features of loverboys and the loverboy method, such as the use of seduction, on 
young women or girls, by young men, and to exploit them in prostitution, seem increasingly 
not to be entirely accurate. What makes a human trafficker a loverboy, or precisely what the 
loverboy method involves, is therefore not easy to define.

70 The same phenomenon is also referred to by the term ‘pimp boys’.

Humanitas PMW on the methods of loverboys
The annual report of Humanitas Prostitutie Maatschappelijk Werk72 in 2008 showed that the 
methods of many loverboys have changed in recent years. Whereas in the past a lot of time 
and attention was devoted to so-called grooming, nowadays violence and blackmail are quickly 
used to force girls to work. Loverboys are not averse to using any method to recruit a girl for 
prostitution, according to Humanitas PMW. The use of (sometimes excessive) violence, rape, 
deflowering and blackmail with photographs or video recordings are all methods that have 
been used, although, according to Humanitas PMW, the use of violence or the threat of it is 
the most effective means. Violence or the threat of it, rather than seduction might also make 
it easier to separate these girls from the offenders, since there is less chance of ‘addiction to 
the loverboy’. Loverboys also use physical violence to guarantee the organisation’s income.73 
Humanitas PMW reports that almost all of the victims of loverboys that they counsel have suf-
fered serious physical violence.74 Besides active forms of recruiting, there can also be passive 
recruitment. Young men who are known for their lifestyle attract girls who want to be with 
them or belong to a group.

Humanitas PMW also observes that loverboys can operate in a small network, in which several 
victims are created by several offenders with links to each other. So loverboys do not always 
work alone, but rather in ad hoc or permanent networks that seem less organised than interna-
tional human trafficking gangs.75

Victims are not always recruited by the loverboy himself, but sometimes by acquaintances, 
friends or family members.76 One method in which victims are recruited indirectly is that of 
the ‘guardian angel’, which is described in the case below.

The ‘guardian angel’
The victim (A), an 18-year-old girl from a small town, met a loverboy (O) there and was then 
forced into prostitution by a group (D), which was associated with O, by means of violence, 
threats and blackmail. S., the actual human trafficker, who was a friend of group D, ‘rescued’ A 
from the group, only to exploit her himself.77

Victims of loverboys
The third report of the NRM stated that the victims of loverboys are not all underage Dutch 
girls, but that the method is also used on adult women and in transnational human traffick-
ing.NRM3 As regards the type of victim who is the target of loverboys, it now appears that

they are certainly not always girls or young women from a difficult background; even better-
educated women from properly functioning families can be victims of a loverboy.

Loverboy/lovergirl
It is not just young men who can be described as loverboys. There are also women who 
employ the loverboy method to exploit other girls. This type of exploitation by women, 
who are also known as lovergirls, has not yet been scientifically investigated, but did receive 
public attention following an article in the free newspaper Metro.78 Various organisations 
say they feel that these lovergirls might themselves be victims of a loverboy.79 In that case, 
using a victim to recruit new girls could be seen as a new method of recruitment. There are 
also indications that the loverboy method has been adopted by other organised human traf-
fickers. For example, the method is said to have been used by a group of Bulgarian human 
traffickers.

The aim of the exploitation by loverboys
The third report of the NRM also referred to loverboys who exploited their victims for pur-
poses other than prostitution alone.NRM3 For example, there have been cases where victims 
were forced to borrow money or open accounts and surrender the money to the so-called 
moneyboy. In a letter to parliament in June 2008, the Minister of Justice said he was aware 
of this variant of the loverboy, but had no information to suggest that the problem was com-
mon or increasing.80 Some victims are also coerced by a loverboy into smuggling drugs. Two 
such cases are described in Chapter 6.

Locations of recruitment by loverboys
The locations used by loverboys to meet potential victims also seem to change constantly. 
Besides traditional locations, such as discotheques and in and around schools, there are signs 
that recruitment increasingly takes place via the internet. Loverboys reportedly seek contact 
with potential victims mainly on social networking sites. There are no actual figures for the 
extent to which loverboys use the internet, but the police in the Rotterdam-Rijnmond region 
conducted a study into the use of the internet by loverboys. The findings of that study were 
not yet known at the time this report was written.

girls. One part of the project was a survey of the demand for information about lovergirls from organisations 
like Pretty Woman, BLinN, The Youth Care Agency, Asja, the Domestic Violence Advice and Support Cen-
tre and several individual stakeholders (Van Eckeveld et al., 2008).

350

Various victims, aid organisations and investigative agencies are aware of these new methods 
of recruitment by loverboys. However, it is not clear whether these signs indicate a shift in 
the methods they use or to what extent such a shift is actually occurring.81

All in all, many elements of the traditional image of a loverboy no longer seem to apply, and 
may even be outdated. At the same time, the loverboy method is increasingly referred to 
in the context of a situation of exploitation. Consequently, it has become unclear what the 
terms loverboy and the loverboy method actually involve. It seems almost impossible to give 
a definition that encompasses every variant of the loverboy method and at the same time 
indicates the extent to which the loverboy method differs from other methods used by hu-
man traffickers. The description of loverboys used by the Minister of Justice in a letter to the 
Lower House of Parliament, “boys who bring girls into prostitution against their free will”,82 
is an example of a definition that is so broad as to have almost no distinctive character.
The fact that the loverboy method quickly adapts and that new variants and methods are 
constantly emerging does not necessarily mean that the classical loverboy method is no 
longer used.
To respond effectively to the new methods, however, it is essential to closely monitor the 
changes that do occur. Humanitas PMW observes that the outdated view of the loverboy 
problem means that in projects designed to combat loverboys, a lot of emphasis is wrongly 
placed on increasing the ability of the girls to resist them.83 A better insight into the constant-
ly changing methods used by loverboys would facilitate more specific prevention methods.

Eastern European models
Within groups of human traffickers from Eastern Europe, Shelley84 makes a distinction be-
tween the Albanian or Balkan Model and the Post-Soviet Model. Becucci85 only refers to the 
Albanian model.
The Albanian or Balkan Model consists of small groups of individuals, each of whom ‘man-
ages’ two or three prostitutes. Members of the organisation were born in the same village 
or have family ties. A Balkan network therefore rarely operates transnationally. The traf-
ficker for whom a woman works has exclusive rights over her. Decisions with respect to the 
woman can therefore only be taken with the permission of the trafficker/pimp. The existence 
of a criminal group is apparent mainly from the collective legal support for members of the 
group when they are arrested and the ‘shelter’ provided to the women by other members of 
the organisation when a trafficker is temporarily absent.

81 Verbal information from Humanitas PMW, 22 June 2009; Meid, één aangifte is al voldoende, Metro, 23 June 
2009. Humanitas PMW’s report on the results of the chain approach to youth prostitution in 2008 states 
that loverboys do not shun any method to force girls into prostitution (Humanitas PMW, 2008).

Victims of this type of trafficker are almost all women from Balkan countries or women 
who were bought by the Balkan traffickers from Eastern European traffickers. The criminal 
group controls the victims from the moment that they come into contact with the traffickers 
in the country of origin up to and including their exploitation in the sex industry in Western 
Europe. The most striking feature of the Balkan model is the extreme violence used against 
the female victims. Shelley accordingly describes this type of human trafficking as the violent 
entrepreneur’s model. The degree of control exercised by Balkan human traffickers over the 
women is striking. The women have absolutely no autonomy: they are under continuous ob-
servation because the pimps accompany them everywhere. Becucci describes how the pimp 
exercises control by calling the victim every five minutes at a prearranged location that can 
be monitored. A trend has recently been observed where Albanian exploiters use less vio-
lence and imposes less strict constraints on victims. Instead of the trafficker exercising con-
trol, another prostitute or a girlfriend of the human trafficker assumes the task of managing 
a group of women. Reference was made earlier to the reports that Bulgarian traffickers also 
employ loverboy methods.

Shelley describes the Post-Soviet model as the natural resource model. The traffickers who 
employ this model differ from the Albanian and Balkan traffickers in that the Post-Soviet 
traffickers limit themselves to recruiting and selling women to other traffickers, such as Al-
banian and Balkan traffickers. The aim of these traffickers is to make a quick profit and not 
exploit the women over a longer period. Becucci interprets this repeated selling of women 
as fragmentation of criminal activity, since an organisation that arranges the entire human 
trafficking process is guaranteed greater profits.

Leman & Janssens observed that a number of Albanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian and Russian 
gangs they investigated constituted networks, consisting of small, flexible and replaceable 
organisations that uses easily available personnel who can be quickly replaced. Each indi-
vidual organisation is then part of a well-organised network spanning several continents. 
Although each unit follows it own rules, the cooperation between the units is based on con-
tracts.86

The Chinese Model
Knowledge about the methods used by Chinese human traffickers involved in prostitution is 
limited. The field research by Knotter, Korf and Ying Lau showed beyond doubt that there 
is an overlap between the Chinese beauty sector and prostitution and that there are also 
Chinese sex houses, brothels and escort companies operating in the Netherlands. However, 
Chinese prostitutes operate mainly in their own community and behind closed doors, in 
apartments or in massage parlours. Consequently, little is known about the extent to which 
the prostitution is coerced. However, the women often see prostitution as the only alterna-

tive to hard work and low wages in their own country. They usually come from areas that 
were suddenly confronted with poverty.87

The Nigerian Model
The Nigerian model, finally, is discussed at length in §9.5. The key aspects of this model are 
female madams, coercion through voodoo and the ‘victim-becomes-perpetrator’ process.

9.4.4 The interface between the illegal and legal sectors

The Programme to Strengthen the Approach to Combating Organised Crime reports that 
when legal and illegal markets are closely entangled there can be a very thin line between 
using and abusing services and facilities. This can constitute a direct threat to the social envi-
ronment of ordinary citizens.88 The illegal activities of criminals, including human traffick-
ing, can become entangled with legal activities and markets in various ways and to different 
extents. Criminals use legitimate services and facilities in the course of their criminal activi-
ties. Third parties that provide these services or facilities can be regarded as conscious or 
unconscious facilitators of criminal activities. The entanglement of legal and illegal activities 
can also arise when criminals themselves practice a legitimate profession.

Local embedding
In the third report of its Organised Crime Monitor, the WODC looked at the extent to which 
criminal organisations use local facilities in pursuing criminal activities.89 This report was 
based on an analysis of 120 completed investigations, only a small number (15) of which in-
volved human trafficking. Because the monitor makes no distinction according to the type 
of offence, it is not possible to report only on the cases of human trafficking that were inves-
tigated.
The degree to which criminals are locally integrated has consequences for the activities of 
both the criminals and the investigators. It is very difficult for criminals to operate success-
fully without local embedding. It is less easy for criminal organisations to secure the neces-
sary facilities if they have only limited local connections. On the other hand, criminals with 
few local ties can disappear more easily if the risk of discovery becomes too great.90

In this context, Van de Bunt and Kleemans discuss a human trafficking case in which Alba-
nian human traffickers in Amsterdam forced women into prostitution. The group operated 
to a large extent without local connections and, for example, only used cars with German 
registration plates which made the members of the group easily recognisable. Because they 
had scarcely any local contacts, the traffickers had difficulty securing access to windows for

prostitutes in the red light district. On the other hand, when the police launched raids on 
the premises used by the offenders, other members of the group were able to quickly escape 
without leaving any traces.

However, the WODC monitor91 shows that the majority of the offenders operate in an en-
vironment they are familiar with. It therefore seems to be a misconception to think that 
transnational organised crime has no local embedding. Offenders integrated in a local com-
munity have many existing relationships with the legitimate sector as well as potential of-
fenders. These ‘local heroes’ scarcely operate beyond the local level, unless they are able to 
join international criminal organisations via international ‘bridge builders’ or at rendezvous 
points.92

Labour
The third report of the Organised Crime Monitor also discussed the extent to which mem-
bers of criminal organisations practice legal professions. A strikingly large number of the 
suspects referred to in the monitor had no work. The type of work performed by suspects 
that did have a profession initially seems highly diverse. Nevertheless, there are some com-
mon features. For example, a relatively large number works in professions connected in 
some way with mobility, transport or logistics (the employees have a considerable degree of 
independence in how they do their job or the type of work they do). Also professions with a 
social character, involving contact with other people are over-represented.93

Facilitators
Criminal organisations need the legitimate world to be able to pursue their criminal activi-
ties. Actors in the legitimate world can either consciously assist a criminal organisation in its 
activities or unconsciously facilitate crime.
The administrative report of the Sneep investigation (Schone Schijn) describes a number of 
facilitators who helped the human traffickers with their activities. The first category was pri-
vate institutions or individuals. For example, a consultancy firm handled the group’s admin-
istrative affairs and a real estate firm arranged practical matters, such as cars, mobile phones 
and accommodation. In the Sneep case, there were also doctors involved, who carried out 
breast enlargements and a number of abortions for the women in the group. Tattoo artists 
tattooed the women concerned.94

Taxi drivers play a role in human trafficking by transporting victims of forced prostitution. 
The link between the taxi sector and prostitution is by no means always criminal in nature, 
but sometimes taxi drivers do facilitate criminal activities. Several criminal investigations 
into taxi drivers have shown this to be the case. In 2006 a taxi driver was convicted of hu-

man trafficking because he drove women from the Czech Republic to the red light district 
in Groningen. It is not clear whether he made these international journeys as a taxi driver, in 
the sense of using a car with a taxi permit.95

Other professional groups that can be involved in organised crime are lawyers and civil-law 
notaries.96 Culpable involvement in the narrow sense of intentional behaviour rarely occurs. 
As far as criminal lawyers are concerned, the most common form of culpable involvement is 
influencing and putting pressure on witnesses, according to investigating officers and pub-
lic prosecutors.97 Situations in which lawyers and, to a lesser extent civil-law notaries, fail 
to observe the standard of care required of them (culpable involvement in the wider sense) 
do seem to occur regularly.98 Possible explanations for the attraction of these professional 
groups for organised crime include the duty of confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, their 
independence and the individual nature of the work performed by lawyers and civil-law no-
taries.99 The Council of Europe also refers to builders of websites as possible facilitators of 
human trafficking.100

Besides these private individuals who facilitate the work of human traffickers, the report 
Schone Schijn examines the role of social workers and various public institutions, such as 
local authorities, Chambers of Commerce, the IND, the Labour Inspectorate, the tax au-
thorities and the police. Some of these agencies can be said to facilitate human trafficking 
in a reactive manner, for example, by allowing companies to be entered in the Trade Regis-
ter without restriction. As far as transnational human trafficking is concerned, the offence 
might also be facilitated by weak governments in the countries of origin and widespread 
cooperation by parents, travel agents and hotel owners, for example.101

The government devotes a lot of attention to the role of facilitators and this entanglement 
of legitimate and illegal activities. A parliamentary working group studied the matter102 and 
the Minister of Justice wrote to the Lower House of Parliament in June 2009 that “it is not 
only necessary to tackle human trafficking in its primary form, but also everything going on 
around it”.103

98 Culpable involvement exists in both a narrow and a broad sense. In the narrow sense, the professional is 

criminally involved in the criminal conduct. In the case of culpable behaviour in a broad sense, the profes-
sional has not consciously or intentionally cooperated with the criminal actions, but can be blamed for fail-
ing to observe the necessary care to avoid abuse of his services for criminal purposes. Involvement can also 
be active or reactive. The active variant involves an act on the part of the service provider, whereas in the 
reactive form he or she has failed to act or has allowed an abuse to occur.

In response to the report Schone Schijn, at the request of the Lower House of Parliament,104 
the Ministry of Justice also started an investigation into the performance of medical surgery 
without the personal agreement of a client.
In addition to the criminal law, facilitators in many professional groups can also be dealt 
with through disciplinary procedures. In response to the practices uncovered in the Sneep 
investigation,NRM5 BNRM arranged a meeting between the Dutch Society of Abortion Doc-
tors and the Dutch police’s Centre of Expertise on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smug-
gling to discuss signs that could indicate human trafficking. The plan is to draw up a protocol 
setting out how human trafficking can be recognised and actions that abortion doctors can 
take if they suspect coercion. Minister of Justice Ernst Hirsch Ballin has also informed the 
Lower House of Parliament that medical operations performed under coercion can be dealt 
with via criminal law and the medical profession’s disciplinary procedures.105 There are no 
plans to draft a similar protocol for other professional groups, such as plastic surgeons, for 
example.

9.4.5 Use of the internet and other technologies

Human traffickers use various new technologies in different ways. While new technologies 
are not in themselves a cause of new forms of crime, they do add a new dimension to tradi-
tional forms of crime.106 One of the most important new technologies is the internet. One of 
the advantages of using the internet for criminal groups is the large degree of anonymity it 
offers and the ease with which crimes can be committed. Communication by internet is also 
cheap and difficult to trace.107

The Council of Europe distinguishes three categories of users of new technology in relation 
to human trafficking: traffickers, clients and possible victims.108

Traffickers use new technologies, first and foremost, to communicate with each other. The 
Council of Europe’s report mentions various methods that are used to prevent their commu-
nication being traced, such as communicating in e-mail chains through different countries 
and different time zones or using telephones and internet connections that transmit false 
identifying details. Another familiar method is the use of prepaid mobile telephones that are 
then immediately thrown away.
Human traffickers also use the internet to recruit victims. The most important method of 
recruitment on the internet involves advertising for work or mediation in forming relation-
ships on a website. Traffickers can easily, and usually anonymously, contact potential victims

via online work, dating and marriage-mediation agencies.109 Maltzahn suggests that specific 
links between recruitment via the internet and human trafficking are not clear but acknowl-
edges the ease with which it can happen.110 The Council of Europe’s report also stresses that 
it is often unclear whether a website is genuinely offering jobs or a dating service or is trying 
to recruit victims for human trafficking.111 According to that report, however, websites that 
are used to recruit victims for sexual exploitation display a certain consistency. Such web-
sites often advertise domestic work or work as an au pair, work in a bar or restaurant staff, 
work in construction, manufacturing, agriculture or tourism, as well as work as a model, 
dancer or sex worker, as a cover for international human trafficking.112 This method of re-
cruitment actually differs little from traditional recruitment methods via advertisements in 
newspapers. It is, however, possible that the type of victim who looks for a job on the internet 
differs from the type of victim who is recruited through newspapers.
In addition to advertising jobs, a second method of recruitment through the internet seems 
to be emerging. Human traffickers can easily come in contact with potential victims via chat 
sites and websites like MSN Live Messenger, Hyves and Sugarbabes, using a false identify 
or otherwise.113 Indications that loverboys already use this method were already mentioned 
in §9.4.3.

Traffickers use the internet to exploit victims as well as to recruit them. Victims can be forced 
for perform sexual acts on the internet (webcam sex), and there are also indications that vic-
tims are persuaded to perform sexual acts in front of a camera, with the images then being 
used as means of coercion.

Traffickers also use the internet to recruit clients. There are even indications that a woman 
will only be transported to the country of destination if enough clients have responded to 
advertisements for her on internet.114 There are international differences in terms of the 
criminalisation of sexual advertisements on the internet. As a result, websites with sexual 
advertisements are produced in countries where legislation has not banned them, including 
the Netherlands. In one case, a criminal organisation in Estonia took advantage of the Dutch 
legislation by advertising trafficked women in Scandinavia on a website with a Dutch serv-
er.115 Since escorts and prostitutes who work voluntarily also try to reach clients via internet, 
it is not easy to trace victims of human trafficking.

Internet and clients, victims, NGOs and policymakers
Clients of prostitutes often seek contact with other clients on the internet to share or describe 
their experiences.

For victims, the internet can be a useful tool for finding agencies to help them. The Rode Draad 
reports an increase in the number of victims that have found the organisation via the internet, 
in both the Netherlands and other countries.
NGOs and policymakers concerned with human trafficking can benefit from the internet for 
the distribution of educational materials and information about human trafficking.116 Finally, 
the internet could also conceivably be used for (police or criminal) investigations.

9.4.6 The female human trafficker

Various authors have reported that human trafficking is not solely a male business, but that 
women also operate as human traffickers. One of the conclusions of the UNODC report on 
human trafficking in February 2009 was that female offenders in fact play a more promi-
nent role in human trafficking than in any other form of crime.117 Shelley states that human 
trafficking is the only form of international crime in which women play a leading role, but 
that women are also to be found in the lowest echelons of human trafficking organisations.118 
According to Europol, the number of female offenders is significant and growing. Women 
seem to be engaged particularly in the recruitment phase, but are also said to be increasingly 
involved in organising and controlling the victims.119 A study by Siegel and de Blank of 10 
cases of convicted female human traffickers in the Netherlands showed that these women 
had played an important role in criminal organisations engaged in human trafficking in the 
Netherlands.120 Although most female human traffickers are from other countries and work 
in large transnational organisations, Siegel and de Blank also discovered Dutch offenders 
and a number of women who operated alone.121

According to Siegel and de Blank, the roles performed by female offenders can be divided 
into three categories: the executors, the partners-in-crime and the self-employed. Executors 
are often compelled to carry out specific tasks, such as controlling other women and collect-
ing their earnings. The boundary between offender and victim is very vague in this category. 
One reason why women perform the tasks may be loyalty to the trafficker, although loyalty 
is a stronger motive among women in the partners-in-crime category. The extent to which 
female offenders are themselves victims of human trafficking and are forced to perform 
criminal activities is also described in Chapter 6 of this report. Women who cooperate with 
the organisation as a partner-in-crime usually have close ties with the male trafficker. They 
are often either relatives of the trafficker or victims who have risen in the organisation by 
cooperating. Women in these positions are roughly equivalent to the men and share in the

duties and the earnings. The majority of the women who work independently are African 
(Ghanaian and Nigerian).122

9.5 Nigerian human trafficking in the Netherlands

Since the early 1990s, the Netherlands has been familiar with the phenomenon of unaccom-
panied underage asylum seekers from Nigeria disappearing from reception centres; some of 
them have later been discovered working as prostitutes in the Netherlands or elsewhere in 
Europe. In 1999, the Nigerian Association in the Netherlands published a study into the traf-
ficking of girls from Nigeria for exploitation in prostitution in the Netherlands. This report 
divided these Nigerian girls into three distinct categories: girls who came to the Netherlands 
for political or humanitarian reasons and were later taken from asylum centres by human 
traffickers and ended up in prostitution; girls who were brought to the Netherlands under 
false pretences about the type of work they would be doing and were eventually forced to 
work as prostitutes; and finally girls who consciously came to the Netherlands with the in-
tention of working as prostitutes.123

Nigeria has meanwhile become one of the leading countries of origin of victims of human 
trafficking in the Netherlands, having been ranked in the top five since 2005.124 However, 
the Netherlands is not the only country of destination for the victims of Nigerian human 
traffickers. Other Western European countries (particularly Italy) and the United States are 
also popular destinations.125 This trend in Nigerian human trafficking arises from the desire 
among Nigerians to emigrate to the West and the limited possibilities they have to do so, 
which gives human traffickers a free hand.126

9.5.1 Pull and push factors

Nigeria became a British colony in 1914. The country’s borders were drawn without tak-
ing account of cultural boundaries: very different groups of people with different cultural 
backgrounds suddenly belonged to the same nation. Seven years after the country attained 
independence in 1960, a civil war broke out which lasted three years. From 1970 until 1998 
various dictators held power in Nigeria, but even after free elections were held in 1999, eve-
ryday life has not improved for most Nigerians because of poor governance and corruption. 
Consequently, poverty and violence have been a feature of daily life for most Nigerians for 
decades.127

122 For the methods employed (of beter applied/used) by these madams, see §9.5.
123 Oviawe & Iyare (1999)
124 See Table 4.1
125 It should be noted here that Nigeria is a country of origin, a transit country and a country of destination for 

human trafficking. There is also human trafficking from Nigeria to other countries in Africa, where victims 
are mainly exploited in domestic service (NAPTIP, 2005).

When unemployment and the accompanying poverty increased in the 1980s, families came 
to depend on women for their survival. The first women arrived in Europe to perform un-
skilled (non-sexual) work around this time, broke the traditional pattern of male migra-
tion.128

It was quickly discovered that there was a demand for African prostitutes in Europe, a pull 
factor that soon drew large numbers of independent Nigerian prostitutes to Europe.129 These 
prostitutes in turn brought other Nigerian women to the Netherlands to work for them in 
prostitution and so became the first Nigerian madams in the Netherlands. However, it be-
came more difficult for adult Nigerian women to secure a residence permit in the Nether-
lands when Nigeria came to be regarded as a ‘safe’ country in the 1990s (even though the 
conditions under which Nigerians lived in their own country had not improved, even after 
democracy was established in 1999), and the desire to escape the poverty remained. Since 
the 1990s, madams have arranged for more and more underage Nigerian girls to come to the 
Netherlands, since unaccompanied underage aliens will not immediately be returned to their 
own country but will be placed in care.130

For most Nigerian women and girls, working in the West seems to be the best strategy for 
escaping from their lives of poverty and helping their families.131 The visible signs of success 
(nice homes, cars and clothing) and the associated status of the wealthy madams who re-
turn to Nigeria confirm this impression and make the dream seem realistic and achievable.132 
These push factors are strongest in the province of Edo and several other areas in the south-
ern, Christian part of Nigeria,133 which is also where both the victims and perpetrators134 of 
Nigerian human trafficking predominantly come from.
Another important push factor, apart from escaping poverty and the desire for status, is 
the glorification of the West.135 The West is attractive to a lot of people, including girls from 
wealthier Nigerian families.136

laxed at this time and aimed mainly at integration (NRM3, 2004). The current, stricter policy, aimed at repa-
triation, has in fact not had any influence on the influx of unaccompanied underage aliens from Nigeria.

9.5.2 Nigerian human traffickers and organisational structure

West African (including Nigerian) criminal networks consist of individual cells composed 
of replaceable individuals. The networks are consequently flexible and difficult to oversee.137 
Nigerians have a worldwide reputation for their fraudulent practices, many organised from 
the Bijlmer district of Amsterdam, also known as the ‘419 fraud’. The money earned from 
these activities is often invested in other criminal activities, such as drug dealing and human 
trafficking.138

In the Netherlands, Nigerian human trafficking activities are carried out both by individu-
als and by criminal organisations. The gangs can range in size from a small group of two or 
three individuals to large international criminal networks made up of dozens of people with 
different roles.139 The Nigerian organisations are involved in the entire chain of human traf-
ficking activities, from recruiting victims in their own country to exploiting them in the sex 
industry in Europe.140 A remarkable feature is the role that women often play in the human 
trafficking organisations.141 For example, there are madams in Nigeria who recruit victims 
and bind them to a ‘debt-repayment contract’ using voodoo. Sponsors are also needed in 
the country of origin (both men and women, and sometimes even the madam herself), to 
advance the money for the trip and provide false papers for the victim. During the trip to 
Europe, the victims are sometimes accompanied by ‘trolleys’, who are usually men. And then 
there are madams in the country of destination (sometimes the person who recruited the vic-
tim in Nigeria; otherwise, a person closely related to the madam in Nigeria), with or without 
a male partner, for whom the victims have to work and to whom they surrender the money 
they earn until they have paid the debt incurred in Nigeria. These madams will sometimes 
have former prostitutes working for them in the country of destination. These ‘controllers’ 
or ‘supervisors’ collect the money from the working prostitutes or perform other supervi-
sory tasks for the madam.142

9.5.3 The method

The victim in Nigeria is usually first approached by an acquaintance,143 who then introduces 
her to a madam and a sponsor (if that is a different person). The victim is told an impressive 
story about the ‘golden opportunity’ for her to go to Europe and work. She is told she will 
quickly earn a lot of money to support her family and will eventually return to Nigeria as a 
wealthy woman and start her own business. Some victims do not know they will end up in 
prostitution in Europe and are deceived with stories about other types of work, in health care,

for example. Other victims do know that they will be working in prostitution in Europe, but 
are not aware of the conditions under which they will have to work.144 Although prostitutes 
are social outcasts in some parts of Nigeria, including Edo,145 many choose prostitution in 
preference to a life of poverty that offers them no dignity at all.146 Once the victim (and/or her 
family) has been persuaded, she has to sign a contract with the ‘madam’ (and the ‘sponsor’) 
promising to repay the costs incurred for her trip to Europe (the costs of travel and false pa-
pers). This contract is usually made binding by a priest in a religious ceremony.147 Using voo-
doo, packages are made up of materials from the victim’s body (nails, hair, blood, etc.) and 
kept by the priest. The victim is threatened that if she breaks the contract or fails to honour it 
completely, she will be punished by the priest. Nigerians attach great importance to this tradi-
tional voodoo, which has been integrated into the Christian culture (in the south of Nigeria) 
and the Islamic culture (in the north). In addition to this religious ‘pact’, the victim’s family 
often also concludes another formal contract, offering family possessions as security.148

The victim, now in possession of false identity papers, then travels to Europe. She makes the 
trip either by plane or by land across the Sahara, sometimes accompanied by a ‘trolley’.149

The Netherlands is frequently the country of destination or a transit country to other Eu-
ropean countries for Nigerian human traffickers, who often use the Dutch reception proce-
dure for unaccompanied underage aliens. In that case, on their arrival in the Netherlands the 
victims are placed in shelters or asylum centres150 and, as soon as they arrive there, they call a 
number they were given in Nigeria. Not long after this telephone call, the victim is collected 
by one of the human traffickers and disappears ‘to an unknown destination’ as far as the 
Dutch authorities are concerned.151

In reality, from that time on the victims are forced to work in prostitution and to surrender 
almost all the money they earn to the madam in the Netherlands or elsewhere in Europe. The 
working conditions and the wage do not correspond with what the victims who knew they 
would be working in prostitution were told in Nigeria. Furthermore, they are charged inter-
est on the debt and have to pay for board and lodging, the rent for a window (if they are work-
ing in window prostitution), lingerie, contraceptives and other necessities.152 Sometimes the 
debt is also increased as a punishment, for example if a payment is late.153 On average, it takes 
one to three years to repay the entire debt to the madam.154

145 It should be noted here that prostitution is accepted in some parts of Nigeria and that even in Edo the percep-

tion of prostitution is changing (Siegel, 2007).

362

Victims do not dare to escape during the period of their sexual exploitation, mainly be-
cause of the fear instilled in them by the voodoo ritual they went through. They believe 
that they will go crazy or die if they do not repay the debt and so fail to honour the con-
tract.155

It should be noted here that voodoo rituals are a very common and accepted practice in Ni-
gerian culture and are not generally regarded as threatening or used as an instrument of 
compulsion. The sense of intimidation is created by the human traffickers, who use the tra-
ditional rituals to manipulate the girls and make them fearful.156 Consequently, the coerced 
prostitution of Nigerians is too often associated with voodoo in Europe, particularly by the 
media, although it has very little to do with traditional Nigerian voodoo157.
Besides the fear of reprisals connected with the voodoo ritual, the victims often also face 
enormous social pressure that prevents them from rebelling against their exploitation. They 
dare not to return to Nigeria without any money, because their families have often vested all 
their hopes of a better future in them.158 The stigma of ‘failure’ is attached to anyone who re-
turns to Nigeria without a story of success in the West (in other words with money).159 At the 
same time, the victims and their families in Nigeria are often threatened if the victim does 
not perform her work properly and family members run the risk of losing all of the posses-
sions they offered as security for the contract.160

The psychological weapons described above – voodoo and social pressure – as well as the 
prospect that the exploitation will eventually end, prompt victims to honour the contract. 
Once they have bought their freedom, they can start earning money for themselves by work-
ing as an independent prostitute or as a controller or supervisor, and they can eventually 
even become a successful madam.161 These factors make it difficult to combat the Nigerian 
form of human trafficking, since many victims do not want to be ‘saved’ but want to com-
plete their contract and become successful themselves.162

There are three factors that are unique to Nigerian human trafficking. The first is that the 
perpetrators are very frequently women and the second is the psychological weapon of voo-
doo, which is used instead of physical force to exploit victims in prostitution. The third, and 
possibly most characteristic, factor is that victims can buy themselves out of their situation, 
plus the associated possibility to make a career and ultimately become madams themselves. 

155 Becucci (2008).
156 Van Dijk et al. (2000); Carling (2006). It is not only human traffickers that abuse the voodoo rituals. The 

victims can use the fear of the ‘voodoo curse’ to justify their illegal residence and their involvement in an 
immoral profession (Bovenkerk, 2001, pp. 154-159).

157 Bovenkerk (2001, pp. 154-159).
158 Siegel (2007); Carling (2005).
159 Adepoju (2005).
160 These psychological instruments of coercion largely eliminate the need to use physical force, so Nigerian 

human trafficking is often less violent than other types of human trafficking (Becucci, 2008; Carling, 2005). 
However, sexual violence is used relatively often (Verbal information from EMM,. 28 July 2009).

This ‘victim-becomes-perpetrator’ process ensures that the Nigerian human trafficking 
structure keeps replicating itself.163

9.5.4 The Nigerian response to human trafficking

Until recently, victims of human trafficking were regarded as prostitutes in Nigeria. Human 
trafficking only became a political issue in Nigeria after warnings from NGOs at the end of 
the1990s, which led to Nigeria’s signing the UN’s Palermo Protocol in 2000 and ratifying it 
in 2001. This international protocol was transposed into national legislation in 2003 with the 
adoption of Nigeria’s Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Law Enforcement and Administration 
Act, which provides, among other things, that human trafficking in Nigeria is punishable by 
a prison sentence ranging from a minimum of 12 months up to life. The act also created the 
National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP) 
as the central Nigerian authority for combating human trafficking. NAPTIP is responsible 
for coordinating all the activities relating to human trafficking in Nigeria.164 It carries out 
research into the nature and scale of human trafficking in the country, helps with investiga-
tions and prosecutions of human trafficking and provides shelter for victims of human traf-
ficking in safe houses and rehabilitation centres.165

NAPTIP has encountered a number of problems in the performance of its tasks. Some are 
general and are inherent to the nature of the offence, such as the international and covert 
character of human trafficking. But there are other problems that are specific to efforts to 
tackle human trafficking in Nigeria, such as NAPTIP’s limited resources; corruption among 
police officers, staff of Nigerian embassies and officials who issue visas; a lack of active polit-
ical cooperation; overpopulation; unemployment and poverty; the desire of potential victims 
to acquire wealth and status; and the unwillingness of victims to testify against offenders 
(especially because of the voodoo pact they made).166

NAPTIP attaches great importance to international cooperation, especially with regard to 
the prosecution of perpetrators, particularly the principal leaders of the human trafficking 
organisations. Close cooperation between NAPTIP, Interpol, Europol and the countries 
of destination is therefore very important. In that regard, both parties, the Netherlands as

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

9.5.5 The mega case: Koolvis

In May 2006, the Centre of Expertise on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (EMM) 
received a report from a lawyer who suspected that her Nigerian client was a victim of human 
trafficking.168 An analysis of flights at Schiphol Airport, carried out in response to this report, 
showed that a relatively large number of unaccompanied underage aliens from Nigeria had en-
tered the country in the period from October 2005 to May 2006. It was also observed that af-
ter October 2005, more unaccompanied underage Nigerians had disappeared without a trace 
from shelters and safe houses for victims of human trafficking throughout the Netherlands. 
More than 30 incidents similar to the original notification were identified. This prompted the 
launch of the Pekari project, designed to gather intelligence and then investigate incidents 
involving Nigerians. The project was later continued as the Koolvis investigation169.
The Pekari analysis showed that the Netherlands was again being used by Nigerian criminal 
organisations as a transit country in human trafficking. It was being used as the port of entry 
to the Schengen area through the misuse of the asylum procedure or, in some cases, the B9 
regulation for victims of human trafficking, and the associated shelter.170 The final destina-
tion was usually Italy or Spain, where the unaccompanied underage Nigerians were then 
exploited by being forced to work as prostitutes171.
The methods used by the Nigerian human trafficking organisation exposed in the Pekari/
Koolvis investigation largely corresponded with the methods described above.172 For exam-
ple, the Nigerian girls and young women were approached by a recruiter in Nigeria, usu-
ally through their family or friends. Some were told that they would be expected to work in 
prostitution in Europe and others were not. They then had to swear an oath before a voo-
doo priest173 that they would repay a sum of money (between 30,000 and 50,000 euro) in

170 In the Netherlands unaccompanied underage aliens are guaranteed entry (as in most other European coun-
tries). The Netherlands does not send them back to their country of origin, but initially always places them 
in an open shelter system, whose addresses are widely known. Other likely factors in the choice of the Neth-
erlands as a transit country are that there are direct flights from Nigeria to Schiphol and good connections 
from the Netherlands to other European countries (Operatie Koolvis, NRC Handelsblad, 14 March 2009; 
Torremans (2009, unpublished); Verbal information from EMM, 28 July 2009).

171 Hofstra, (2006, unpublished); Torremans (2009, unpublished); J. Hendriks, Seminar on ‘Nigerian criminal 
networks’, Police Academy, 12 May 2009

172 This method is therefore not new. The first investigations into Nigerian human trafficking in the Nether-
lands had already been conducted in the 1990s, when it had become apparent that Nigerian human traf-
ficking organisations abused the Dutch asylum procedure. Since then, more or less the same method has 
been observed every time. Other European countries have had similar experiences (Operatie Koolvis, NRC 
Handelsblad, 14 March 2009; Verbal information from EMM, 28 July 2009).

173 The ‘voodoo’ priest, working for the human trafficking organisation is usually a pastor and not a real priest. 
In contrast to a priest, anyone can be a pastor since no theological study is required. What is remarkable is 
that the ‘voodoo’ priests who worked for the human trafficking organisation in this case were not prosecut-
ed, even though their role had a huge influence. After all, they were responsible for the principal psychologi-
cal instrument of coercion used to exploit Nigerian victims.

exchange for the necessary papers174 and the trip to the country of destination. The girls all 
came to the Netherlands by plane, with or without an escort.
On their arrival, they followed the procedure that had been explained to them beforehand. 
They first disposed of all their travel documents and identity papers so that their journey 
could not be easily traced. They then reported to the authorities at Schiphol and applied for 
asylum in order to secure a temporary residence permit. At this point, on the instructions 
of their traffickers, some claimed protection under the B9 regulation for victims of human 
trafficking.175 They all told the authorities the same carefully prepared story, explaining why 
they were seeking asylum or protection as a victim. Many of the girls were also in possession 
of the same telephone numbers or letters of introduction from Nigerian aid organisations 
or religious institutions. Once they had been placed in the asylum centre or a safe house for 
victims of human trafficking they called the telephone number they had been given in Ni-
geria. Very soon they were collected from the centre and forced into prostitution under the 
supervision of a madam in the Netherlands or another European country (mainly Italy and 
Spain) by the human trafficking organisation. The girls forced into prostitution by this hu-
man trafficking organisation also had the possibility of eventually buying off their contract 
and making a career176.
As with the Sneep investigation (in 2006), in the Koolvis investigation the programmatic 
approach to tackling organised crime was also adopted. In this approach, various agencies 
(including some not involved in criminal investigations) cooperated on the basis of the so-
called barrier model. They included the EMM, the National Criminal Intelligence Service 
(DNR), the Royal Dutch Marechaussee (including the Sluis team at Schiphol airport), the 
Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and the Social Intelligence and Investigation 
Service (SIOD).177 On the initiative of the Pekari project, for the first time there was also 
large-scale international cooperation with Europol, Interpol and the police forces of the var-
ious countries (Nigeria-NAPTIP, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, 
the United Kingdom and the United States) in which the human trafficking organisation 
operated in the Koolvis investigation.178

The focus during the project was on three priority areas: first, preventing the influx of un-
accompanied underage aliens, in this case from Nigeria, by organising rapid action teams 
(SATs) to conduct pre-boarding inspections at the airports in the countries of origin in an 

174 Repeated use is made of the same false source- and travel documents to transport the victims to the Nether-
lands. 

175 This shows that the human trafficking organisation was very familiar with the prevailing immigration law in 
the Netherlands (Verbal information from EMM, 28 July 2009).

177 Various regional police forces, the national office of the public prosecuition service, the Central Agency for 
the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA), security services, Nidos (the national agency for the guardianship 
of refugees and asylum seekers), the Human Trafficking Coordination Centre (CoMensha) and airlines were 
also involved in this investigation.

effort to stop them from leaving;179 second, preventing the disappearance of unaccompa-
nied underage Nigerian aliens from Dutch shelters by means of the pilot scheme with closed 
shelters;180 third, tracing unaccompanied underage aliens who had ‘disappeared’.
At the same time, a protocol for the detection of potential victims, which was very similar to 
the list of indicators in the Instruction on Human Trafficking, was drawn up in an attempt to 
prevent as many potential victims as possible from leaving Nigeria and to find as many of the 
victims who had ‘disappeared’ in the Netherlands as possible.181

Thanks to the cooperation and the focus on the three priorities, the entire criminal organi-
sation and more than 140 victims were ultimately identified. This led to coordinated inter-
national raids in October 2007 (and in January 2008 in Italy) and the successful arrest of 
dozens of suspects, including ‘fixers’ who arranged accommodation and connecting travel in 
the Netherlands, and madams in Italy who had ‘ordered’ the victims, etc. The four primary 
suspects included the main sponsor (who had his own travel agency in Nigeria and who ar-
ranged the false documents) and three leaders of the organisation in Great Britain, Ireland 
and the United States.182 Some of the suspects had remarkable police records, which showed 
that some of them had repeatedly been arrested over the years for practices related to human 
trafficking.183

Thanks to the effective international cooperation and the programmatic approach, the 
Koolvis investigation probably broke up the entire human trafficking organisation.184 How-

179 However, according to BlinN this does not combat human trafficking and victims are not protected. The 
intervention occurs during the human trafficking process (after recruitment and during transport) instead 
of when it is assumed to start. The likely effect is that the pre-boarding control will cause the route to be 
changed, which will lead to additional costs, which will ultimately be demanded from the victims, so the in-
tervention is counter-productive (Press release from BLinN: Straffen daders enige effectieve middel om daders 
te bestrijden, 2 April 2009, published on blinn.nl). 

180 It should in fact be taken into account that the victims themselves often do not regard the shelter and the con-
trol within it as ‘helpful’. In their view, it actually puts them and their families at risk since they are then un-
able to perform their contract with the traffickers. For more information on the ‘closed shelter’ pilot project 
(vergelijk met andere hoofdstukken: pilot beschermde opvang), see Chapter 4. 

181 Hofstra (2006, unpublished); Torremans (2009, unpublished). The main aim of the study as originally de-
signed was to operate proactively so that Nigerian human trafficking could be tackled structurally. The ob-
jective was revised, mainly because of insufficient resources and the regional organisation of the police in 
the Netherlands that sometimes made cooperation at national level difficult. Ultimately, the operation was 
solely reactive (Verbal information from EMM, 28 July 2009).

lice Academy 12 May 2009; Verbal information from EMM, 28 July 2009.

183 J. Hendriks, Seminar on Nigerian Criminal Networks, Police Academy, 12 May 2009. An article recently ap-
peared in the newspaper about a human trafficking organisation that operated in Italy, among other places, 
which had been rolled up. Those arrested included Dutch suspects and a number of Nigerians who had been 
involved two years earlier in the Koolvis operation in the Netherlands (Heering, 25 June 2009). As already 
mentioned, this shows that the Nigerian human trafficking organisations are flexible. In other words, it is not 
only possible to replace a single person if he or she disappears from the criminal organisation, but that even 
when the entire criminal organisation around an individual disappears (is rolled up), that person can easily 
join another organisation. 

184 Up to then, national or regional police investigations had only rendered parts of human trafficking organisa-
tion sharmless (rendered harmless? is dat onschadelijk maken?). This part was then quickly replaced, so that 
the human trafficking could simply proceed.

ever, after the gang members were rounded up and some of the victims had been found, the 
victims initially refused to report crimes or make incriminating statements. They refused to 
talk for fear of the police, deportation and, particularly, the consequences of breaking the 
voodoo pact they had made. The police eventually sought the help of a hands on expert (a 
former Nigerian victim of human trafficking) and a Nigerian priest. They were able to win 
the trust of some of the victims, remove their fear of the police (and of the voodoo curse), and 
convince them to report the crime. This creative method led to dozens of reported crimes185 
but also to criticism, for example from the suspects’ lawyers, who argued that the priest had 
‘put words into the mouths’ of the alleged victims and that they had been manipulated by be-
ing offered a residence permit in exchange for making an incriminating statement.186

Only Nigeria, Italy and the Netherlands are prosecuting the suspects; the other countries 
involved have extradited the suspects they arrested. Eleven are currently facing trial in the 
Netherlands. The first day of the actual proceedings was in March 2009; the ‘hands-on’ ex-
pert and the priest appeared as witnesses in May. The case was adjourned until the end of the 
summer in 2009 because some aspects of the investigation had still to be completed187.
Since October 2007, the month in which the human trafficking organisation was rounded 
up, the stream of unaccompanied underage Nigerian aliens arriving at Schiphol has almost 
dried up.188 However, in view of the flexibility of the organisation behind human traffick-
ing in Nigeria, it is impossible to conclude from this that human trafficking in Nigeria has 
declined. When circumstances change (in terms of such aspects as legislation, security, 
care, the elimination of part of the organisation etc.), destinations, transport routes and/
or methods are also changed. This leads to the relocation of human trafficking activities, or 
the ‘waterbed effect’. One interesting development that has been observed in this context is 
an increase in the influx of unaccompanied underage Nigerian aliens to Switzerland since 
September 2008189.

Noteworthy statistics
Dutch people constituted the largest group of suspects in 2007 (95 out of a total of 280) and 
the largest group of convicted persons (24 out of 73). This once again illustrates that there is 
not necessarily an international dimension to human trafficking.
It is striking that 30% of the suspects and 28% of the convicted persons were not in detention 
at the time of their trial.

Loverboy method
Human traffickers quickly adapt their methods to changing circumstances or in response to 
tougher measures by the government. The loverboy method is an example of this. The popu-
lar image of a young man seducing vulnerable young Dutch girls into forming such a deep 
commitment that he can then get them to work in prostitution for him is no longer so clear 
cut. The practice is no longer confined to young men, nor exclusively to vulnerable young 
girls, nor even only to seduction techniques; the methods are also used in transnational hu-
man trafficking and in exploitation outside the sex industry. The adaptability of human traf-
ficking practices calls for an awareness of the changes that can occur in the group of victims. 
It is regrettable that it is not possible to derive sufficient information from the PPS’s data 
about the extent to which loverboy methods are used.

Facilitators
Efforts to tackle human trafficking do not depend only on receiving signals from individu-
als and agencies that are, coincidentally or otherwise, confronted with human trafficking. 
Another important factor is that numerous individuals and institutions consciously or un-
consciously assist human trafficking by facilitating it – either directly or indirectly. As noted 
above, in the well-known Sneep case, a ‘consultancy firm’ handled the defendants’ admin-
istrative affairs and a real estate company organised cars, mobile phones and accommoda-
tion. Doctors performed breast enlargements and abortions. Tattooists applied tattoos to 
the women involved.
Professional groups that might become entangled with organised crime include taxi drivers, 
lawyers, civil-law notaries, employees of travel agencies and hotels and builders of websites. 
Culpable involvement in the narrow sense (intentional) occurs rarely, in contrast to the fail-
ure to observe standards of care (culpable involvement in the wider sense). Besides these pri-
vate parties, employees of social services, municipalities, chambers of commerce, the IND, 
the Labour Inspectorate, the tax authorities and the police can also play a role.
The so-called barrier model could be used to explore ways of removing the basic conditions 
for human trafficking, while at the same time identifying the conscious and unconscious 
facilitators.

Internet
A special effort is needed to devise methods of preventing the many possibilities that the in-
ternet affords to human traffickers to commit their offences while easily avoiding detection.

Pekari and Koolvis
The Pekari project and the ensuing Koolvis case were innovative in several respects. For 
example, the scale of the international cooperation was unprecedented and for the first 
time there was successful cooperation with the country of origin of the perpetrators and 
the victims (through the organisation NAPTIP). This contributed in identifying probably 
the entire criminal organisation rather than just a part that could have been easily replaced. 
Furthermore, the cultural context in which human trafficking in Nigeria occurs was antici-
pated by employing the services of a Nigerian priest. However, the ‘waterbed effect’ remains 
a persistent problem in human trafficking, in Nigeria and elsewhere. Human trafficking or-
ganisations do not recognise borders, so cross-border cooperation is essential if they are to 
be tackled effectively.

The Public Prosecution Service and prosecution

10.1 Introduction

This chapter contains an overview of relevant policy developments relating to the public 
prosecution service (PPS) in the effort to combat human trafficking and the results of (sec-
ondary) analyses of the human trafficking cases in the PPS’s data over the period from 2003 
to 2007.1 The national developments (in policy) are discussed in §10.2, and the findings from 
the research are covered in §§ 10.3 and 10.4. Section 10.3 contains a review of the number 
of cases registered with the PPS and handled by the PPS or by the courts each year. Section 
§10.4 covers appeals: how many cases were appealed and what were the judgments on ap-
peal? International developments are then discussed in §10.5. The chapter concludes with a 
list of issues and problems that need to be addressed (§10.6).

10.2 Policy developments

10.2.1	 Embedding	of	human	trafficking	in	policy	and	organisation

Memorandum on Strengthening the approach to combat human trafficking and migrant smug-
gling
At policy level, the PPS’s efforts to combat human trafficking are as intensive as ever. At the 
beginning of 2008, the PPS published a memorandum on Strengthening the approach to 
combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling, which contained proposals and guide-
lines for intensifying the effort to tackle human trafficking and migrant smuggling. The 
Council of the Procurators General regards the fight against human trafficking and migrant 
smuggling as an area of specialisation, which is delegated to the regional offices. This devel-
opment coincides with a number of general changes in the PPS, including the division of the 
PPS into eleven regional offices.2

From 1 July 2009, all eleven regional offices were to have a regional prosecutor for human 
trafficking and migrant smuggling3 with responsibility for processing human trafficking 
cases throughout the region and handling the major human trafficking cases. They can de-

1 The analyses for this report were again carried our by WODC’s Statistical Information and Policy Analysis 
department (SiBA).

2 See also ‘De OM verandert, de basis’, adopted by the Council of Procurators General (verg. met and. hfd.) 
on 26 January 2005.

3 At the time of the kick-off, that was the case in nine offices. The first meeting of the regional prosecutors 
took place on 11 September 2009. The position had not yet been filled in the Arnhem/Zutphen and Breda/
Middelburg offices.

vote fifty percent of their time to these cases. At their first meeting, the recently-appointed 
regional prosecutors said they also had a major role to play in securing cases.4 Money has 
been earmarked to provide support for the regional prosecutors, as well as for the perform-
ance of their own work. The regional prosecutors are all senior public prosecutors and have 
undergone a rigorous selection procedure. During that first meeting, it was reported that 
a senior prosecutor had also been appointed for human trafficking and migrant smuggling 
in the National Public Prosecutor’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Of-
fences and that an advocate-general has also been appointed to handle appeals in human 
trafficking cases. The major human trafficking cases will be handled by the senior public 
prosecutors responsible for human trafficking, but smaller cases will be handled by other 
public prosecutors. The prosecutors who handle those smaller cases will therefore also need 
to know about human trafficking.

Police forces have said that the designation of a single prosecutor weakens human trafficking 
portfolio,5 particularly in the large cities. They have said that expertise needs to be divided 
among several prosecutors. At the same time, police forces have called for a single, perma-
nent contact person since switching prosecutors does not benefit continuity or the retention 
of expertise. Using alternate prosecutors also makes it impossible to establish good working 
relationships and methods. It is therefore evident that the Programme to strengthen the ap-
proach to combating human trafficking is an attempt to embed the theme of human traffick-
ing at various levels of the organisation, while recognising the importance of support. The 
Reference Framework on Human Trafficking produced by the National Expert Group on 
Human Trafficking (LEM)NRM5 for the police, contains important provisions that are also 
relevant for the further implementation of the approach to human trafficking in the PPS.6

Acquiring and processing cases
Overall responsibility for acquiring cases rests with the local chief public prosecutor. The 
policy paper on Strengthening the approach to combat human trafficking and migrant smug-
gling recommended that the portfolio holder for human trafficking should play a role in that, 
together with the regional office’s information officer and policy assistant/criminologist. 
The role of the portfolio holder, or regional prosecutor for human trafficking, is to initiate 
and organise prosecutions. However, acquiring cases also depends on having the knowledge 
and expertise needed to set priorities. That calls for the police and the PPS to have the neces-
sary capacity and expertise.7

4 The first meeting took place on 11 September 2009.
5 Police Force Monitor 2006, 2007.
6 On this point, see §8.2.
7 According to the criminologist, Natalie Scholten, in general priorities are ultimately a subjective choice. 

“Despite this qualification, the choices made for investigation and prosecution could improve. The usual 
practice is to deal with what comes in”, see Opportuun no. 7, 2008, ‘Goede cases zoeken’, an interview with 
Natalie Scholten, criminologist. She also noted that every force has its own analysts and there is no uniform-
ity. Furthermore, the question posed by the leadership of the police or PPS is not always clear and the analy-
sis therefore does not properly match to what is actually needed. It is important that the Crime Monitoring

373

There is a portfolio holder in each region who handles all the cases in that area of expertise. 
In that context, the prosecutors of cases and the portfolio holders should always operate in 
consultation with each other. This is also important for safeguarding knowledge and exper-
tise.
It is in fact possible that cases are left lying not only by the police but also by the PPS (‘shelved 
cases’). It is then difficult to explain, particularly to victims, why it has taken the PPS so long 
to deal with a case that was sent to it.
The actual nature and scale of this problem is not known and it is perhaps advisable to con-
duct further research into it.

Safeguarding knowledge and expertise
Safeguarding knowledge and expertise is an important subject in the Memo on Strengthen-
ing the approach to combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling. In this context, the 
national meeting of holders of the human trafficking portfolio decided in 2008 to produce 
a manual to provide guidelines for public prosecutors, advocates general and the police in 
assessing a human trafficking case and how to handle it at the hearing. The ‘Manual on the 
approach to human trafficking’ was presented during the first meeting of the regional prose-
cutors with the human trafficking portfolio on 11 September 2009.8 The Training and Study 
Centre for the Judiciary (SSR) is also developing a course on human trafficking for members 
of the public prosecution service and the judiciary. The number of participants following 
courses on human trafficking is rising.
In 2008, the LEM produced a number of standard documents for the police, including a 
model official report that also provides background information about human trafficking. 
This document not only contains guidelines for the police and PPS, but can also help to in-
crease the judiciary’s insight into certain problems relating to human trafficking.

Programme to strengthen the approach to combat organised crime (PVGAM)
The programme to strengthen the approach to combat organised crime is intended to in-
tensify the battle against organised crime in the Netherlands by strengthening the criminal 
law, administrative law and international instruments for tackling organised crime. Human 
trafficking is one of the four specific themes addressed in the programme, which is discussed 
in more detail in §8.2.

Pilot projects
The PPS has earmarked money for innovative methods of fighting crimes that fall within 
the priority categories (including human trafficking). Offices can apply to organise a pilot 
project. The pilot projects in the field of human trafficking are discussed in §7.6.1.

Analysis (CBA) (zie hfd. 9) has a clear position in the policy cycle. The first steps of acquiring a case (includ-
ing preparing a CBA, drawn up by police under the auspices of the PPS) are now delegated to the regional 
offices.

Barrier model
One element of the programmatic approach9 is the so-called barrier model.NRM5 This model 
was developed by the SIOD and applied in the Sneep investigation into human traffick-
ing and coerced prostitution in Amsterdam, Alkmaar and Utrecht. The model is designed 
to disrupt the ‘business processes’ that are needed to commit crime and spend the profits 
from it. The figure below shows the barriers identified for human trafficking (and migrant 
smuggling)10 as well as the organisations that can provide relevant information about offend-
ers, facilitators and victims. One of the measures proposed by the Human Trafficking Task 
Force (measure 3) is the further elaboration and implementation of the barrier model.11

10.2.2  Practical manuals

Instruction on human trafficking
The Instruction on Human Trafficking summarises the key points of the efforts to tackle 
human trafficking. The Instruction sets out how human trafficking should be investigated 
and prosecuted. Indications of human trafficking must be dealt with and relevant leads must 
be investigated and, if possible, lead to a prosecution.12 International cooperation must be 
actively sought in cases involving transnational human trafficking. The investigation of hu-
man trafficking must include a financial investigation and an enquiry into the possibility of 
deprivation of illegally obtained profits.
The Instruction includes an appendix containing a list of indicators that officers in the field 
can use to identify human trafficking. The Instruction also provides guidelines on how to 
deal with victims and witnesses and their reported crimes or statements. In another appen-
dix, a section is devoted to the treatment of victims, which is based on the principles set out 
in the Instruction on care of victims.13

The Instruction on Human Trafficking was amended on 1 January 200914 and now specifi-
cally mentions the Human Trafficking Task Force as one of the agencies engaged in tack-
ling human trafficking. Established by the Minister of Justice in February 2008,15 the Task 
Force is responsible for identifying obstacles to tackle human trafficking and for proposing 
solutions for them. The Task Force will support the programmatic approach and dissemi-
nate best practices by monitoring pilot projects. The heading ‘Pre-investigation, supervi-
sion and enforcement’ in the Instruction applies to the organisation of the supervision and 
enforcement of the rules governing both the prostitution sector and other coerced labour 
or services (‘other forms of exploitation’). The new Instruction makes it clear that, with 
respect to both forms of human trafficking, the plans for actions in the context of the su-
pervision of aliens and the plans for inspections and preventive controls must invariably 
state that possible victims of human trafficking are to be given the opportunity to report 
the crime or otherwise cooperate with an investigation and prosecution. With reference 
to the B9 regulation, the Instruction explicitly states that where there is even the slightest 
indication of human trafficking the individuals must be made aware of the possibility of 
claiming B9 status and must be informed that they are entitled to a period of up to three 
months to reflect on whether they wish to report the crime or cooperate in some other way 

12 The Instruction on human trafficking (Government Gazette 2008, 235) states that, as soon as a serious indica-
tion of human trafficking is discovered during a check, investigation or other activity, the agency concerned 
must inform the competent public prosecutor. In addition, it must be reported to the Centre of Expertise 
on Migrant smuggling and Human Trafficking (EMM) of the National Criminal Intelligence Service. If the 
EMM has additional indications from other agencies, it gathers these leads and sends them to the competent 
public prosecutor (chapter II Criminal Law Approach to Human Trafficking). The Instruction also states 
that information may be provided to the EMM by the agencies that are involved in the supervision, control, 
investigation and help for human trafficking (§2.4). Obviously, this should also happen.

with the investigation and/or prosecution. As regards the intake interview, the current In-
struction once again highlights the fact that the B9 regulation applies both to investigations 
into exploitation in the sex industry and investigations into other forms of coerced labour 
or services (‘other forms of exploitation’).
The new Instruction explains that human trafficking can be prosecuted ex officio and that 
a report of crime is not necessary to investigate and prosecute a case. Although a report of 
crime may be ‘withdrawn’, that does not have any legal consequence since, according to the 
Instruction, human trafficking is not an offence that can only be prosecuted after a report of 
crime. The report of crime is recorded by the regional force that conducted the intake inter-
view. If the offences occurred in another region, the human trafficking expert of the other 
region will be contacted to decide how the case will be handled.
Finally, the Instruction also contains more details on the information to be provided be-
tween the PPS and IND, particularly about continued residence after the B9 status ends. It is 
also important that these agencies share information in situations where the PPS declines to 
prosecute but where there is a victim.16

The PPS has also issued other relevant instructions in addition to the Instruction on Human 
Trafficking and the previously mentioned Instruction on the Care of Victims. They include 
the Instruction on the investigation and prosecution of sexual abuse,17 the Instruction on 
confiscation18 and the Instruction on joint international investigation teams. 19

10.3  Statistics on cases dealt with by the PPS and courts

This section provides statistics on the prosecution of human trafficking cases by the PPS and 
the decisions rendered by the courts. The tables show how many cases were registered by 
the PPS and dealt with by the PPS or by the courts in each year. In other words, no cohort is 
followed.20 The research method is explained in Annex 2.

For practical reasons, there are no detailed figures available for 2008. Table 10.1 does give a 
number of key data for 2008 and similar data for previous years. The figures in the rest of this 
chapter relate to the period from 2003 to 2007.

16 On this point, see also Chapter 5.
17 Government Gazette 2008, 253.
18 Government Gazette 2009, 40.
19 Government Gazette 2008, 45.
20 In other words, they are not always precisely the same cases because cases are not all registered and dealt 

with by PPS and decided by the court in the same year.

As already observed in §9.1, the number of convictions for human trafficking in 2008 was 
higher than in 2007 in absolute terms (at this point nothing can be said about a possible 
growth of convictions in relative terms since the number of cases handled in first instance by 
a court in 2008 is not yet available). In 2008, more minors were also convicted than in earlier 
years. However, the number of underage victims in human trafficking cases registered by the 
PPS in 2008 was substantially lower than in 2007 (27 compared with 56). The percentage of 
cases with underage victims fluctuated during the period from 2004 to 2008.
As with the statistics on suspects and offenders in Chapter 9, the reference date for the key 
figures in the table above is later than for the figures presented in the rest of this chapter. 
The minor variations in figures that appear in the different tables are probably the result of 
changes made in the PPS data between the reference dates.

With the entry into force of Article 273a Dutch Criminal Code on 1 January 2005 – renum-
bered as Article 273f in the middle of 2006 without substantive amendment23 – exploitation 
in sectors other than the sex industry and certain activities relating to the removal of organs 
were also criminalised under the title ‘human trafficking’. Unfortunately, the text of the arti-
cle makes it impossible to break down the PPS data according to the nature of the exploita-
tion (in the sex industry, in other economic sectors or in relation to the removal of organs) on 

21 This is two fewer cases than were mentioned in the sixth report of the NRM. The two cases involved of-
fences that were committed in 2005 and were originally but are no longer registered as human trafficking.

22 Later in this chapter, 58 cases involving minors as victims are mentioned. The probable explanation for this 
discrepancy is the difference in the reference dates used for the key data and for the more detailed data in the 
other tables.

the basis of the individual sections and subsections. What is known, however, is that all cases 
up to 2005 were related to exploitation in the sex industry and that some cases in 2006 and 
2007 involved exploitation in other sectors. None of the cases were related to the removal of 
organs.

10.3.1 	 Human	trafficking	cases	registered	by	the	public	prosecution	service

In 2007, the PPS registered 280 criminal cases involving a suspicion of human trafficking 
(alone or together with other offences),24 which represented a sharp increase compared with 
the two preceding years.25 In this context, a criminal case refers to the prosecution of a single 
suspect.

Table 10.2 shows the number of cases and, as far as it is known, how many of these cases 
involved underage victims.26

The number of registered cases fluctuates: the small number of cases recorded in 2003 and 
2005 was followed by high numbers in 2004 and 2006, with a record number of 280 cases reg-
istered in 2007. The number of cases involving underage victims also fluctuates: the number 
fell in 2004 and 2006 and rose in 2005 and 2007, both in absolute and relative terms.

In Article 250 of the Dutch Criminal Code, those are section 1, subsection 3 and section 2, subsection 2. In 
Article 250a of the Dutch Criminal Code, they are section 1, subsections 3 and 5 and section 2, subsection 
2. In Articles 273a and 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code, they are section 1, subsections 2, 5 and 8, section 3, 
subsection 2 and section 4.

27 This is two fewer cases than were mentioned in the sixth report of the NRM. Groen (SiBa) observed that 
these are two cases in which two offences committed in 2005 and originally registered as human trafficking 
are now registered as employers’ fraud.

28 Table 10.1 mentions 56 cases involving underage victims. A probable explanation for this discrepancy is the 
difference in the reference dates used for the key figures in Table 10.1 and the more detailed statistics in this 
and other tables.

Over the entire period from 2003 to 2007, at least29 19% of all cases also or only involved 
underage victims. This says nothing about the total number of underage victims, since there 
could have been more than one in each case. 

Table 10.3 shows which court district the cases were registered in and the rankings of the 
districts in terms of the number of registered cases. In the latter case, only the five highest-
ranking districts are mentioned. An apostrophe indicates that the district shares that posi-
tion in the ranking.

30 In this report there are again minor discrepancies with the numbers mentioned in previous reports, prob-
ably as a result of corrections in PPS data after the reference date used in the earlier analyses. Because the 
discrepancies are minor they are not discussed individually.

In 2007, the largest number of cases was registered by the office in Amsterdam. The Hague 
and Zwolle shared second place, closely followed by Rotterdam in third place. Groningen 
is fourth, closely followed by Utrecht. Although some offices generally have few human 
trafficking cases (Assen, Dordrecht, Middelburg, Roermond) and others regularly have a 
large number (Amsterdam, Den Bosch and The Hague are almost always in the top five), the 
number of cases registered in each office fluctuates sharply over time. Over the entire period 
from 2003 to 2007, Amsterdam had the largest number of cases, followed by The Hague, 
Rotterdam and Den Bosch.31 As previously reported,NRM6 the effort made by an office is not 
judged solely by the number of cases it has registered.

Most human trafficking cases in the period 2003 to 2007 involved aggravated human traf-
ficking: cases in which two or more persons acted in concert, in which there was a victim 
who was younger than 16 years or in which serious physical injury was caused. Cases of non-
aggravated human trafficking also occurred fairly frequently in that period. In 2007, eight 
cases were registered under 273a/f, section 4 (human trafficking committed in concert and in 
which a victim younger than 16 was involved), and three cases registered in 2007 concerned 
Article 273f, section 5 (human trafficking leading to serious physical injury). In the rest of this 

31 The number of cases in Den Bosch has declined every year since 2004.
32 Perhaps unnecessarily: registration, a summons or a conviction under Article 250ter/a, section 2 or Article 

273f, section 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Dutch Criminal Code involves the aggravating circumstances under which 
human trafficking is committed.

33 Article 250ter/a, section 3, Article 273a, section 5 and Article 273a/f, section 6 of the Dutch Criminal Code 
are not mentioned in the table because no offences against them occurred in the relevant period.

chapter, the only distinction made in the tables is between non-aggravated human traffick-
ing (human trafficking without aggravating circumstances) and aggravated human traffick-
ing. No reference is made to specific provisions of the Dutch Criminal Code. 

Human trafficking is often committed in combination with other offences,34 meaning that a 
case can then involve multiple offences. Table 10.5 provides a list of the most serious regis-
tered offences in each case involving human trafficking.35 The ‘most serious offence’ is the 
offence with the heaviest potential sentence; it is not intended to imply a qualitative assess-
ment of the offence.

In around 80% of the cases in recent years, human trafficking was the only or the most seri-
ous registered offence. In cases that involved another, more serious offence in addition to hu-
man trafficking, that offence was usually a form of sexual violence. In 2007, sexual violence 
was the most serious registered offence in 13% of human trafficking cases. 
There was a gradual decline in the number of registered cases of human trafficking in com-
bination with ‘participation in a criminal organisation’ (Article140 of the Dutch Criminal 

34 Such as migrant smuggling, rape or attempted rape (or complicity therein), possession or use of weapons, 
intentional deprivation of liberty, attempted or otherwise (or complicity therein), drug-related offences, the 
production and use of false travel documents and assault and intimidation. See NRM3 and NRM5.

35 The classification used by the CBS (behoeft dit vertaling?), in which the offence with the heaviest potential 
sentence ‘prevails’ in each case, has been adapted by creating a separate category for human trafficking. 
Where there are combinations of offences with the same potential sentence, human trafficking is included in 
the table as the most serious offence. If there are then still several offences with the same potential sentence, 
an offence committed earlier prevails.

36 These are human trafficking in combination with crimes against property, destruction/disturbance of the 
peace, fraud, bribing a public official, making false statements, bigamy, conveying a minor while drunk or 
removing a minor from parental authority, for example. See also NRM3.

37 This is not the same as the sum of the individual percentages in this column because the individual percent-
ages have been rounded off.

Code), until there were none at all in 2005, but that combination did occur again in 2006 
(29 times) and in 2007 (65 times), representing 14% and 23% of all cases respectively. This 
seems to confirm the conclusion in the sixth report of the NRM that resources are not being 
devoted solely to cases designed to deliver a ‘short, sharp blow’ or involving perpetrators 
operating alone.

manded in custody, by year of registration.

In 2007, 84% of the suspects were initially on remand.39 This percentage has risen slightly 
every year since 2004. 
The information in the previous sections was only concerned with criminal cases registered 
by the PPS. Table 10.7 covers cases dealt with by the PPS in the same years.40 

Even more than in previous years, issuing a summons was by far the most commen method 
by which cases were dealt with in 2007 (85% of cases). In the majority of cases (81%), sum-
monses were issued jointly or solely for human trafficking. In 4% of cases, no summonses 
were issued for human trafficking, only for other offences. The number of cases in which an 
unconditional decision was taken not to prosecute fell quite sharply, to 12% of cases in 2007. 
These cases were abandoned mainly for technical reasons. 
Conditional decisions not to prosecute were taken more often in cases where non-aggravated 
human trafficking was suspected than in cases where there were aggravating circumstances.

38 Here too there are minor discrepancies compared with the figures that were presented in the previous re-
port.

39 Table 9.9 contains information about detention taken from the BNRM’s study of case law. However, the 
figures in the two tables cannot be compared because the study of case law is based on cases of sexual exploi-
tation in which the court of first instance ruled in 2007, while Table 10.6 includes all human trafficking cases 
(including cases of other forms of exploitation) that were registered by the PPS in 2007. It is not known how 
many of these registered cases were also dealt with by the courts in 2007.

40 It may seem strange that the PPS dealt with more cases in 2006 than were registered, but this is due to the 
fact that no cohort was followed and the PPS does not always make a decision on whether to prosecute in the 
same year as a case is registered. In fact, there are also minor differences between this table and the figures 
presented in earlier reports.

The PPS’s data provide no insight into the type of joinder involved. The OM can join cases 
‘ad informandum’ or ‘for trial’. The type of joinder has consequences for how the offence that 
is joined is dealt with. A joinder for trial means that a summons is issued for the offence on 
a single indictment with another offence (under a different cause-list number). A joinder for 
trial is therefore a settlement of the case by summons. Where an offence is joined ad inform-
andum no charges are brought, but it is joined with another case to allow the judge to take it 
into account in determining the sentence. The judge can only do so if the suspect admits the 
offence. Since joinder for trial means a summons is issued for the joined offence and no sum-

41 This refers to a summons solely or jointly for human trafficking.

43 These are cases where, despite an earlier suspicion of and registration under human trafficking, a person is 

not charged with human trafficking but is charged with one or more other offences.
44 To a different district or to another country.
45 Joinder is the joining of different offences into a single case.
46 A conditional decision not to prosecute occurs when the PPS provisionally postpones the decision to pros-

ecute.
47 An out-of-court settlement involves the (voluntary) payment of a sum of money to the PPS, whereupon the 

PPS abstains from prosecuting (in Dutch called: ‘transactie’).

ages have been rounded off.

mons is issued for an offence joined ad informandum, it would be relevant to know whether a 
joinder was for trial or ad informandum. 

10.3.4  Disposition by the court 

To recapitulate, in 2007 the PPS registered 280 cases involving a suspicion of human traffick-
ing. In the same year, the PPS handled 221 cases, 180 of them by issuing a summons. 

Table 10.8 gives an overview of judicial decisions, by the year in which the case was decided. 
The table shows that in 2007 the courts of first instance dealt with 120 cases in which the 
charges included human trafficking. This number does not seem to correspond with the 
number of cases (108) covered by the BNRM’s study of the case law. There are various rea-
sons for this, the main one being that the survey of case law focused exclusively on cases of 
sexual exploitation, while the PPS data also cover cases involving exploitation in other sec-
tors (‘other forms of exploitation’). For more detailed information about this reason, and 
other explanations, and the results of the BNRM’s study of the case law, see Chapter 11.

In 2007, the district court in Almelo declared that it had no jurisdiction in the Sneep caseN-
RM5.54 In that case, the decision led to the lifting of provisional custody. The six defendants 
ultimately stood trial in June 2008 before the district court in Almelo and were all convicted 
of human trafficking. The judgments are not yet final and irrevocable. The appeals were not 
expected to be heard before the autumn of 2009. 

In 2007, almost a third of the suspects (32%) were acquitted of human trafficking. These cases 
consisted of a full acquittal (12%) and cases where suspects were convicted of other offences, 
such as sexual and other forms of violence (20%). In all of these cases, the defendants were 
acquitted of human trafficking. As in previous years, however, a large majority of the cases in 
2007 resulted in a conviction (81%), although this percentage is lower than in previous years. 
For BNRM, the total number of convictions is less relevant than the number of convictions for 
human trafficking, since the total number also includes convictions solely for other offences. As 
already mentioned, 20% of the suspects in 2007 were only convicted of offences other than hu-
man trafficking, which means that there was only a conviction for human trafficking in 61% of 
the cases. The other outcomes occurred sporadically in 2007. In this survey, ‘joined at trial’ actu-
ally says nothing about the actual settlement of the case as it refers only to a procedural aspect.

54 On 25 May 2007, the District Court in Almelo declared that it had no jurisdiction; the court was acting as an 
adjunct to another district court but the PPS had summonsed the defendant before the court in Almelo. The 
suspect appealed against this decision to the appeal court in Arnhem. No decision had been made on this ap-
peal on 11 June 2007, the date on which the PPS brought the case before the district court in Utrecht (sitting 
in Almelo). On 11 June, the district court in Utrecht therefore ruled the PPS’ prosecution inadmissible.

10.3.6 	 Convictions	for	human	trafficking	

Sentences imposed 
Table 10.10 contains an overview of the nature of the sentences imposed in those cases where 
suspects were convicted of human trafficking. Unlike Table 10.9, the table does not contain a 
break-down according to the most serious offence in the charges, but is based on the number 
of cases in which there was a conviction for human trafficking. Because human trafficking 
was not the most serious offence in every case, the number of principal sentences cannot 
be compared with the number of convictions in Table 10.9. Cases in which a summons was 
issued for human trafficking but where there was no conviction for human trafficking are 
ignored here.

56 This table also contains discrepancies with data presented in earlier reports. They are in some respects sub-
stantial.

57 These are unconditional sentences, unless stated otherwise.
58 An additional sentence can be imposed (for example, deprivation of illegally obtained profits) or an order 

made (for example, detention under a hospital order). Contrary to what the term implies, the court can also 
impose an ‘additional’ sentence alone (Article 9, section 5 of the Dutch Criminal Code). Sentences including 
an order for detention under a hospital order are not registered separately in the data the BNRM received 
from the PPS.

59 In this table, combinations of a custodial sentence and a fine or a community-service order are included in 
the category ‘custodial sentence’.

60 Combinations of a community-service order with a custodial sentence are included in this table in the cat-
egory ‘custodial sentence’. The combination of a community-service order and a fine are included in this 
table in the category ‘community service’.

61 In this table, combinations of a custodial sentence with a fine are included in the category ‘custodial sen-
tence’.

Custodial sentences 
In 2007, unconditional custodial sentences were imposed in 69 (95%) of the 73 cases in which 
defendants were convicted of human trafficking. Accordingly, as in previous years, a custodi-
al sentence was the most common principal sentence. An unconditional custodial sentence 
was combined with an unconditional community-service order seven times, and with a fine 
once. The combination of a fine and community service did not occur in 2007. In the period 
from 2002 to 2006, custodial sentences were imposed in combination with an (uncondi-
tional) community service order 15 times. During that period, a custodial sentence was com-
bined with an (unconditional) fine eight times, and a combination of a fine and community 
service was imposed twice. Other principal sentences, such as only community service or a 
fine, were imposed seldom if at all in 2007. The average length of the custodial sentence in 
that year was just over 19 months (592 days) for persons convicted of non-aggravated human 
trafficking and roughly 21 months (642 days) in the case of convictions for human trafficking 
with aggravating circumstances. 

Perhaps more revealing is the overview in Table 10.11, which breaks down the custodial sen-
tences according to the term of the sentence.

In 2007, one-third of the custodial sentences imposed in first instance were for a period of up 
to one year. That is fewer than in 2006, while the proportion of sentences with terms of one 
to four years increased (62% in 2007 compared with 43% in 2006). 
There seems to be a downward trend in the severest category (prison sentences of more than 
four years). 

This table relates to convictions for human trafficking. Looking at the most serious offence 
for which a person was convicted in a human trafficking case, the highest average custodial 
sentence in 2007 was imposed for sexual violence: 1284 days (SD: 1790), or more than 42 
months (three and a half years).62 In previous years, the highest average prison sentence was 
imposed where violence was the most serious offence. 

10.4 Statistics on appeals 

The PPS data only contain information about the settlement of cases in first instance. The 
BNRM received information from the WODC’s SiBA department on the settlement of hu-
man trafficking cases on appeal during the period from 1997 to 2007 and a number of key 
figures for 2008 (see Table 10.12). The information comes from the Judicial Documentation 
Research and Policy Database (OBJD), which is used for research purposes and to assist in 
formulating and monitoring policy. The database is regularly supplemented with informa-
tion from the Judicial Documentation System (JDS). 

62 There was a total of five cases.

The table shows an enormous drop in the number of cases settled on appeal in 2008 com-
pared with previous years. However, these figures are somewhat misleading, since there is a 
significant delay before appeal cases are registered in the database; the figures for 2008 are 
therefore incomplete and the data for 2007 will probably be corrected in the future. The fig-
ures in the rest of this section are for the period up to and including 2007. 

The PPS data do provide information about whether an appeal was filed in a case, and if so 
by whom. Table 10.13 provides an overview.65

The table shows that appeals were filed in 46% of cases in 2007, most often by the suspect. 
The percentage fluctuates slightly over the years. 

In the 11-year period reviewed, the OBJD records show that 267 cases involving one or more 
human trafficking offences were dealt with on appeal. Two cases in which the judgment was 
missing were deleted. Table 10.14 shows the years in which the remaining 265 cases were 
heard.

Human trafficking was the most serious offence in almost three-quarters of the cases heard 
on appeal. In roughly a quarter of the cases, the most serious offence was not human traffick-
ing. Non-aggravated human trafficking was the most serious offence dealt with on appeal far 
more often than aggravated human trafficking. 

Table 10.17 gives an overview of the decisions on appeal according to the most serious of-
fence for which an appeal was filed and on which the appeal court ruled. Percentages are only 
given in the cells with larger numbers.73

70 Here too, the offence of human trafficking has been chosen in the case of offences of ‘equal seriousness’ 
(according to the CBS classification). For other types of offence with equal degrees of seriousness, WODC/
SiBa gives priority to sexual and other forms of violence over other offences.

A conviction is by far the most common decision in human trafficking cases on appeal (237 
times). Acquittals occur most frequently in appeal cases where aggravated human traffick-
ing is the most serious offence (11 times), although this applies mainly for the period 2003 
to 2007.

Table 10.18 shows the nature of the sentences imposed in the 237 appeal cases in which there 
was a conviction for human trafficking, alone or together with other offences. These are 
unconditional sentences, except in the category ‘only conditional’.74

Over the entire period, an unconditional custodial sentence was imposed in 88% of the ap-
peal cases in which a defendant was convicted of human trafficking. In 7% of the cases the 
heaviest sentence imposed was community service. A conditional sentence or a fine was im-
posed occasionally.

10.5	 Concentration	of	the	handling	of	human	trafficking	cases	

In June 2008, the Allocation of Cases Committee (the Van Dijk Committee) published a re-
ported for the Council for the Judiciary on the question of whether, from the perspective of 
quality and efficiency, cases should be concentrated in particular courts.77 According to the 
Council for the Judiciary, the court system needs to be adapted to respond to developments 
such as the growing complexity of cases, increasing specialisation in the PPS and legal prac-
tice and growing demands on the quality of the administration of justice.78 
The Council of Procurators General responded positively to the Van Dijk Committee’s re-
port, saying that it was concentrating on four areas of specialisation at regional level, in-
cluding human trafficking.79 The NRM said in a response to the report that standard human 
trafficking cases could be allocated according to the system of regional offices of the PPS, 
but mega cases should be concentrated in a small number of district and appeal courts.80 
However, the National Coordination Centre for Mega Cases was not immediately willing to 
assign human trafficking cases to a small number of courts in the Netherlands. It was agreed 
with a representative of the National Public Prosecutor’s Office that the PPS will press for 
the concentration of human trafficking cases in a smaller number of courts when the occa-
sion calls for it.81 
In its fifth report, the NRM recommended consideration of whether there should be spe-
cialisation in human trafficking in the judiciary. Specialisation in and concentration of hu-
man trafficking cases would certainly improve the quality of the administration of justice 
since human trafficking is a complex offence that demands that knowledge and expertise 
be accumulated and safeguarded.82 An important aspect in this regard is that a basic and an 
advanced course in human trafficking have been developed for SSR.83 
Contrary to the advice of the Van Dijk Committee, the NRM feels that a strict separation 
between the National Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Office for Economic and Environ-
mental Offences for human trafficking cases is inadvisable, given that human trafficking 
cases are brought by both offices.84

10.6  International developments – Eurojust 

Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in criminal cases is very important for tackling hu-
man trafficking. Relevant developments in the Netherlands in this context are described in 
Chapter 8. This section discusses developments relating to Eurojust, the agency established 
to promote cooperation in law enforcement between the authorities of the member states of 
the European Union. 

Eurojust is an EU agency that was founded in 2002 to promote coordination between the 
competent judicial authorities in the EU member states in investigating and prosecuting 
serious forms of transnational and organised crime. Another of its aims is to improve co-
operation between the competent authorities, particularly by facilitating the execution of 
European arrest warrants through international legal assistance. By its nature, Eurojust’s 
tasks cover cases in which at least two European countries are involved. 

The number of cases referred to Eurojust by various countries is still rising. The number of 
cases in 2006 (771) rose by 31% compared to the number in 2005 (588). The number rose by 
a further 41% to 1,08585 in 2007 and to 1,193 in 2008. The number of requests made by the 
Netherlands to Eurojust has also risen steadily – from 21 in 2005, to 31 in 2006, to 70 in 2007 
and to 104 in 2008. The number of requests made to the Netherlands has also increased – 
from 95 in 2005, to 131 in 2006, to 162 in 2007. There were 161 requests to the Netherlands in 
2008. These requests concerned a range of offences and not just human trafficking. 
The number of cases handled by Eurojust in which Europol was involved increased almost 
four-fold from 2006 (7) to 2007 (25). In 2008, there were 30 cases. The number of cases 
involving non-EU member states also rose substantially, particularly with Norway, Switzer-
land and, most especially, the US, where the number of cases went from 6 in 2006 to 30 in 
2007. In 2007, there was an increase in the number of cases involving Liechtenstein, Turkey, 
the Russian Federation or Ukraine, and in 2008, there were 27 cases involving states outside 
the EU. 
The number of human trafficking and migrant smuggling cases referred to Eurojust was 33 
in 200586 and was roughly the same in 2006. Eight of the 30 operational cases in that year 
concerned exploitation in the sex industry and three cases involved other forms of exploita-
tion.87 

85 In its Annual Report 2006 (Eurojust, 2007), Eurojust noted that the number of cases sent by some countries 
had been increasing significantly, particularly from states that joined the EU in 2004, which referred an 
above-average number of cases.

86 While the text of the Annual Report 2005 only refers to human trafficking cases, the tables with statistical 
information show that these are both human trafficking and migrant smuggling cases, no further classifica-
tion is made. The statistical information in the Annual Report 2006 shows the number represents indeed 33 
human trafficking cases referred to Eurojust in 2005, not migrant smuggling cases.

The Public Prosecution Service and prosecution

397

In subsequent years the majority of the cases referred to Eurojust involved exploitation in 
the sex industry.88 
In 2007, there were 71 human trafficking cases referred to Eurojust, an increase of almost 
150% compared with 2006.89 The number rose again in 2008 to 83.

Eurojust also organises so-called coordination meetings, which are meant to facilitate and 
coordinate action in specific cases. There were 91 such meetings in 2006, 25% more than in 
2005. Seven of them were related to human trafficking. The same number of coordination 
meetings was held in 2007, five of which were related to ‘human trafficking or migrant smug-
gling’. There were eight in 2008. 

In May 2008, Eurojust organised a strategic meeting on human trafficking or migrant smug-
gling and witness protection in Portorož in Slovenia with the support of the Slovenian EU 
Presidency. The aim of this meeting was to gain an insight into general criminal phenomena 
and the special mechanisms, standards and best practices that can or should be adopted and 
implemented to protect victims of human trafficking or smuggling during an investigation 
and prosecution.90 

Eurojust has said it wants to establish a centre of expertise on ‘human trafficking and smug-
gling’ and related subjects, which could provide analyses of cases, share information, or-
ganise strategic and tactical meetings, establish a central contact point for missing persons, 
create a legal database with an overview of available legal instruments related to human traf-
ficking and improve cooperation with other European and international crime-fighting or-
ganisations engaged in tackling human trafficking.91 

10.7 Conclusions 

In recent years, the public prosecution service has been very ambitious in its use of crimi-
nal law to tackle human trafficking. However, human trafficking cases do not automatically 
reach the public prosecution service. To realise its ambitions, the public prosecution service 
must actively pursue cases. This is why human trafficking is one of the areas in which the 
public prosecution service has decided to intensify its policy. In the new regions established 
by the public prosecution service prosecutors have been appointed who can devote 50% of 
their time to human trafficking cases. These regional officers will also have a role in securing 
human trafficking cases. The Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Offences 
recently assigned the human trafficking portfolio to a prosecutor and an advocate-general 

88 The annual reports of Eurojust for 2007 and 2008 do not make a clear distinction between exploitation in the 
sex industry and exploitation in other sectors.

89 The Annual Report 2007 (Eurojust, 2008) refers in this context to human trafficking or smuggling (in the 
English version of the annual report: Trafficking in human beings), as well as a category ‘smuggling of illegal 
migrants’.

has also been assigned the human trafficking portfolio. Coordination on cases in the public 
prosecution service takes place in the ‘portfolio owners meeting’.

Areas that demand attention are the need to safeguard continuity in the public prosecution 
service, especially where there is a rapid turnover among the specialist officers, and to ensure 
that there is sufficient capacity. There still seems to be too little time in terms of practical im-
plementation. It is important that there is sufficient expertise and capacity at the local level 
to support the regional officers. 

The Instructions on Human Trafficking were amended and clarified on several points on 1 
January 2009. 

Since 2005, exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry and certain activities relat-
ing to the removal of organs have also been made criminal offences under the heading of 
‘human trafficking’. It has therefore become relevant to gather statistics on the appearance/
prevalence of these forms of offences. The text of article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code 
makes it impossible to distil this information from the PPS data on the individual sections 
and subsections of that article. What is known is that several cases in 2006 and 2007 involved 
exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry and that no cases involving the removal of 
organs have yet been brought.

In 2007, 61% of the prosecutions for human trafficking led to a conviction. Between 2003 and 
2007, there was a noticeable downward trend in the number of unconditional prison sen-
tences of more than four years. This trend seems to contradict the growing political aware-
ness of the seriousness of human trafficking, which led among other things to the increase in 
the sentences from 1 July 2009. 

For the first time, this report presents the data on appeals. Of the 265 appeals heard in cases 
involving human trafficking between 1997 and 2007, the defendants were convicted wholly 
or partially of human trafficking in 237 cases (89%). Over the entire period, a prison sentence 
of more than four years was imposed in 19% of the appeals. In 5% of the cases in first instance 
in 2007, prison sentences of more than four years were imposed. 

The figures presented in this chapter relate to the public prosecution service’s performance 
in a particular period (2003-2007). A constraint of this system is that it provides no insight 
into how cases were handled from beginning to end. A cohort analysis should therefore be 
conducted to provide this information. 

The Council for the Judiciary is considering the question of whether cases of a particular 
type should be concentrated in specific courts. Human trafficking is one of the areas men-
tioned in this context.

Case law on exploitation in the sex industry

11.1 Introduction

One way of tackling human trafficking is by investigating and prosecuting the offenders. The 
criminal courts ultimately render judgment and rule on the offences the suspects are charged 
with. Up to now, research has focused mainly on the methods employed by the police and the 
public prosecution service: the process before the case comes to court. The final outcome, 
in the form of judicial rulings, has never been systematically analysed, but it is important to 
understand how the courts deal with human trafficking cases, since that is also an important 
factor in successfully combating the offence.
BNRM has studied recent case law in the Netherlands concerning human trafficking in the 
sex industry. This review does not cover jurisprudence in the field of exploitation in other 
sectors (‘other forms of exploitation’).1

With both a qualitative and a quantitative element,2 the aim of the research was to gain a more 
complete picture of recent case law. In the quantitative section of the study, the questions in-
cluded the following: What types of human trafficking cases are generally brought before the 
courts? Do the cases mainly involve human trafficking in the Netherlands or transnational 
activities? Are the victims mainly Dutch or of other nationalities? Is it mainly pimps who are 
tried, or also recruiters or transporters? Are these cases mainly those in which victims have 
reported the crime? And what is the effect in terms of the evidence if no crime is reported? 
The following sections answer these questions and present the quantitative findings from 
the study.
In the qualitative part of the study, attention was devoted to types of charges that are brought, 
forms of participation, the attempted form of the offence, aggravating circumstances and 
the interpretation by the courts of the various elements of Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal 
Code.3 The decisions reached by the courts on the possibilities for victims to make a free 
choice and their possible alternatives, and the role these factors play in the courts’ findings of 
whether the charges have been proved or not, are all considered in this chapter. A number of 
aspects are reviewed in more detail, including the assessment by the courts of the reliability 
of statements made by victims, the grounds given for sentences, the sentences themselves, 
claims for compensation made by victims and the compensation awarded.

1 On this point, see §12.6.
2 The explanation of the research methods used is in Appendix 2.
3 A number of these subjects are also discussed in Chapter 12, in connection with exploitation in sectors other 

than the sex industry.

The findings from this study are intended as a guide for the legal practice4 and to serve as an 
instrument to promote consistency in the application of the law.
The quantitative section covers 108 judgments rendered in first instance in 2007,5 involving 
65 different human trafficking cases with at least one and a maximum of seven suspects, and 
encompassing a total of 108 suspects. With the cooperation of the LOVS, BNRM received 
all of the judgments in 2007, in anonymous form.6

The qualitative part of the study also covers all the judgments rendered since 2007 that have 
been published on www.rechtspraak.nl.7

To start with, §11.2 presents some statistics on acquittals and convictions and the particulars 
of human trafficking offences and other offences that were charged in addition to human 
trafficking and declared proven in 2007. (Data on suspects and convicted offenders are pre-
sented in Chapter 9).
Section 11.3 discusses the content of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code, including a brief 
overview of the international background to that article. Section 11.4 illustrates the applica-
tion of the human trafficking provision in criminal-law practice with a number of examples. 
Section 11.5 looks at aggravating circumstances in more detail, and §11.6 discusses attempt 
and complicity. The problems with evidence are discussed in §11.7. In §11.8, data about vic-
tims are presented. The grounds for sentencing are discussed in §11.9. Details of claims for 
and the awarding of compensation are included in §11.10, which also discusses how a link 
can be made with the confiscation of illegally obtained gains for the purposes of providing 
compensation for victims. The chapter ends with a number of conclusions in §11.11.

11.2 Statistics

11.2.1 Acquittals and convictions

Of the 108 cases in 2007 that were studied, 74 (69%) ended in a complete or partial convic-
tion for human trafficking and 34 (31%) in a full acquittal for human trafficking. In 65 cases 
(60%), defendants were acquitted of at least one of the human trafficking offences they were 
charged with.
The percentage of full acquittals for human trafficking (31%) is relatively high in comparison 
with the percentage of acquittals for the offence of rape,8 for example. The percentage of 

4 Wherever possible, the legal terms used are clarified with examples to make the contents of this chapter also 
comprehensible to readers working outside the legal practice.

5 In 105 cases, these were judgments of the district court; three were judgments of the police court. Given the 
seriousness of this offence, the choice of the latter forum is remarkable.

6 Insofar as the judgments discussed were also published on www.rechtspraak.nl, the LJN number is also 
given in this chapter.

7 Naturally, in the context of earlier case law.
8 The comparison is made with this offence because rape is also often difficult to prove. In rape cases, the 

statements of suspects and (presumed) victims are also regularly contradictory.

acquittals on rape charges varied during the period 1995 to 2007, with 13% in 1995 and 2001, 
for instance, but it was never higher than 23% (in 2007).

Because the public prosecution service registers data11 differently from the method used by 
BNRM in this chapter, the figures differ in terms of the number of convictions and acquittals, 
for example. BNRM has only studied human trafficking cases in relation to exploitation in 
the sex industry, while the data from the public prosecution service also include cases relat-
ing to exploitation in other sectors. In the public prosecution service’s data, one case is also 
registered as an acquittal, although in reality there was, at least, a conviction for human traf-
ficking in that case. This explains the discrepancy between the figures of the public prosecu-
tion service (73) and the BNRM study (74) for convictions for human trafficking in 2007. In 
the public prosecution service’s data, acquittals refer to full acquittals on all offences charged, 
while the acquittals in the BNRM’s study are based on full acquittals for human trafficking. 
These are the main reasons for the discrepancies in the data, which are shown in Table 11.2.

Unfortunately, the public prosecution service’s data do not record whether a case involved 
human trafficking in the sex industry, exploitation or intended exploitation in another sector 
or human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal.

In a case, further discussed in §12.6.2, Bulgarian workers were put to work in cannabis planta-
tions. Some female workers were also said to have been sexually abused. Seven suspects faced 
trial. In addition to human trafficking, they were also charged with rape,13 people smuggling, 
growing and preparing cannabis and participation in a criminal organisation.14 The charges of 
human trafficking related to both sexual and other forms of exploitation. The sexual exploita-
tion charges related to the systematic rape of one of the female employees. In cases like this, the 
public prosecution service’s data do not clearly show whether the charges concerned a suspi-
cion of sexual exploitation or of other forced work or services, or both.

11.2.2 Particulars of human trafficking offences

In the judgments that were studied, we also investigated how the courts had qualified the 
74 convictions in human trafficking cases in 2007. Those convictions were for 143 proven 
human trafficking offences out of a total of 228 human trafficking offences charged. The per-
centage of acquittals in relation to the number of human trafficking offences charged (37% ) 
was higher than in relation to the number of human trafficking cases (31%). The 143 offences 
declared proven were qualified by the courts as follows:

The category ‘Other’ consists of ‘attempted human trafficking’ (whether or not ‘in concert’), 
‘continued trafficking in human trafficking, multiple offences’, ‘complicity in human traf-
ficking’ (whether or not ‘in concert’) and ‘human trafficking, with respect to a person who 
had not yet reached the age of 16, multiple offences (whether or not ‘in concert’).

Table 11.4 shows other offences that were charged and declared proven in the 108 cases, in ad-
dition to human trafficking. Even if they were acquitted on all the human trafficking offences 
charged, the defendants might have been convicted of other offences.

in four cases.22 Money laundering, drugs offences and tax evasion was charged in roughly 
one-fifth of all cases, and was declared proven in every case. People smuggling and partici-
pation in a criminal organisation were charged in 12% and 10% of all cases, and declared 
proven in 7% and 6% of all cases, respectively. Influencing the making of a statement was 
only charged in addition to human trafficking in one case and was declared proven, alongside 
an acquittal on the human trafficking charges.

As Table 11.4 shows, human trafficking is often charged together with other serious offences, 
such as violent crimes and offences against public decency.23 Violent crimes and offences 
against public decency can also be seen as means of coercion in a human trafficking offence. 
It is possible, for example, to bring charges for the same rape not only as a separate offence 
but also as a means of coercion in human trafficking (see §11.3.4).

The significance of the use of sexual or physical violence and threats, in the context of the 
situation of exploitation, is discussed in §11.3.4.

11.3 Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code

11.3.1 Introduction

The new human trafficking provision, Article 273a Dutch Criminal Code, entered into force 
on 1 January 2005 (it was renumbered to 273f without any substantive amendment in Sep-
tember 2006). The provision significantly expanded the range of acts that are criminalised as 
human trafficking, adding other forms of exploitation in the area of labour and services and 
the forced removal of organs to sexual exploitation.
In contrast to Article 250a of the (old) Dutch Criminal Code, the new article was inserted 
under the title ‘Offences against personal liberty’ rather than the title ‘Offences against pub-
lic morals’.24 This emphasises the nature of the offence: it is not the sector in which the act 
occurs that makes it an offence, but the fact that the exploitation constitutes a violation of the 
victim’s personal liberty.NRM5

In this chapter, references to Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code refer to the provision that 
applied (as Article 273a as well) from 1 January 2005 to 1 July 2009:

22 That means there were acquittals in almost 75% of the cases.
23 Occasionally, other offences are charged that have no connection with the human trafficking offences. In 

most cases, however, these other offences are offences that occurred in the sphere of human trafficking, such 
as membership of a criminal organisation, violence, rape, money laundering.

24 Since 2000, the punishments for human trafficking in the Dutch Criminal Code have been amended a 
number of times. In 2000, Article 250ter (old) Dutch Criminal Code was replaced by Article 250a (old) 
Dutch Criminal Code and profiting from human trafficking was also criminalised. This was also the year in 
which the Netherlands abolished the general ban on brothels. In 2002, the provision was expanded to exploi-
tation in the sex industry in the broad sense (sexual acts with and for a third party for remuneration) ; in other 
words, no longer just exploitation in prostitution (with a third party).

7. Article 251 is applicable mutatis mutandis.

On 1 July 2009, the human trafficking provision of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code was 
amended again. This amendment related to the applicable sentences and not to the actual 
definition of the offence (see §2.2 and Appendix 1).

The legislature chose to adopt a single human trafficking provision in which many acts of 
varying natures are criminalised. Article 273f is therefore a complex article. The distinction 
between the nature of different types of work or services and between adult and underage 
victims means that a large number of subsections was needed to describe all the criminal 
acts. The result is the longest article in the Criminal Code. It is also not easy to fathom, 
partly because a number of terms that are used are not further explained. These terms come 
from the international instruments on which the new human trafficking provision is based. 
Consequently, it is not only Dutch legal sources that are relevant for the interpretation of the 
article, but also the underlying international legislation, which describes human trafficking 
as, among other things, a serious form of organised crime and a violation of human rights. 
The offence must also be seen in that light.25

11.3.2 International background

A number of binding agreements at the UN and EU level are particularly relevant for the 
Dutch legislation on human trafficking, including the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children26 (2000) and the EU Frame-
work Decision on combating trafficking in human beings (2002).27 The definition of human 
trafficking in Article 273f is based in part on these international instruments.

crime, on 27 July 2005.

Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol (2000) reads:
For the purposes of this Protocol:
(a)  ‘Trafficking in persons’ shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring 

or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of 
abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or 
of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having 
control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at 
a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploi-
tation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 
removal of organs;

(b)  The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in 
subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in sub-
paragraph (a) have been used;

(c)  The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose 
of exploitation shall be considered ‘trafficking in persons’ even if this does not involve any 
of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article;

(d) ‘Child’ shall mean any person under eighteen years of age.

Article 1 of the EU Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings (2002) reads:
1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the following acts are 

punishable: the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, subsequent reception of 
a person, including transfer or exchange of control over that person, where:
a) use is made of coercion, force or threat, including abduction, or
b) use is made of deception or fraud, or
c) there is an abuse of authority or of a vulnerable position, which is such that the person 

has no real and acceptable alternative but to submit to the abuse involved, or
d) payments of benefits are given or received to achieve the consent of a person having 

control over another person for the purpose of exploitation of that person’s labour or 
services, including at least forced or compulsory labour or services, slavery or practices 
similar to slavery or servitude,  
or for the purpose of the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of 
sexual exploitation, including pornography.

2. The consent of a victim of trafficking in human beings to the exploitation, intended or 
actual, shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in paragraph 1 have been used.

3. When the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 involves a child it shall be a punishable human 
trafficking offence even if none of the means set forth in paragraph 1 have been used.

the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) in 
order to promote the harmonisation of legislation.29

11.3.3 Definition of the offence in Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code

In accordance with the UN Palermo Protocol and the EU Framework Decision (2002), the 
definition of the offence in Article 273f (1) (1) Dutch Criminal Code is formulated in terms 
of an ‘act’ (recruiting, transporting, moving, accommodating or sheltering), using ‘force or 
other means of coercion’ with the ‘intention of exploiting’ (Article 273f (1) (1) Dutch Crimi-
nal Code).
The term ‘exploitation’ is explained in Article 273f (2) in the form of a non-exhaustive list of 
what ‘at least’30 constitutes exploitation: exploitation of another person in prostitution, other 
forms of sexual exploitation, forced or compulsory labour or services,31 slavery or practices 
similar to slavery or servitude.32

It should, in any case, be clear that, by definition, exploitation in prostitution, which is the 
subject of this chapter, is exploitation.33

Article 273f (1) (4) makes it an offence for a person to force or induce another person by those 
same means to make himself or herself available for performing work or services or to take 
any action towards another person, in the circumstances referred to, which he knows or may 
reasonably be expected to know will result in that other person making himself or herself 
available for performing work or services.
Wilfully profiting from the exploitation of another person is made a punishable offence by 
Article 273f (1) (6), while subsection (1) (9) makes it an offence for a person to force or induce 
another person by means of coercion to provide him with the proceeds from prostitution or 
sexual acts with or for a third party. These subsections refer to forms of profiting from hu-

29 That means that the proposed definition also encompasses human trafficking for the purpose of removing 
organs. In contrast to the UN Protocol and the Council of Europe’s Convention, the proposal also explicitly 
includes exploitation of activities related to begging or of illegal activities, as one of the forms of exploitation 
(Article (1) (3) of the proposal for a Framework Decision of the European Commission). Given the non-
exhaustive list in the UN Protocol (and in the Council of Europe’s Convention), these forms must also be 
deemed to fall under them – and hence also under Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code.

30 Art. 273f Dutch Criminal Code also implements the UN Protocol, including the words ‘exploitation com-
prises at least […]’ in art. 273f (2) Dutch Criminal Code.

31 The UN Protocol refers to ‘forced work or services’, while the English version of the EU Framework Deci-
sion (2002) refers to ‘forced or compelled work or services’. ‘Compulsary’ also means obligatory, compelled 
or imposed, and is therefore close to ‘forced’. Since the Framework Decision uses both terms together, it is 
proposed including both terms in the description of exploitation (Parliamentary Documents II 2003/04, 29 
291, no. 3, p. 19).

32 The term ‘at least’ in Article 273f (2) Dutch Criminal Code shows that this is a non-exhaustive list. In inter-
national terms, the Dutch legislation is unique in this respect. On the grounds of the legality principle, the 
recent UNODC Draft Law against Trafficking in Persons stated that other forms of exploitation should be 
explicitly included in national legislation. The UN Protocol does not contain a definition of exploitation.

33 This is more complicated for exploitation in other sectors, see Chapter 12. Sexual acts with and for a third 
party for remuneration is prostitution.

man trafficking. The person profiting may be, but is not necessarily, a person other than the 
person who created the situation of exploitation.34

Article 273f (1) (3) makes it a criminal offence to recruit, move or abduct a person with the in-
tention of inducing that other person to make himself or herself available to perform sexual 
acts with or for a third party for remuneration in another country. This provision imple-
ments the 1933 Geneva Convention for the Suppression of Traffic of Women of Full Age.35

A number of elements of the offence are discussed below.

11.3.4 Means of coercion

Art. 273f (1) (1) describes a number of means of coercion:

‘Force, violence or other act, the threat of violence or other act, extortion, fraud, deception, 
abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs, abuse of a vulnerable position, and 
giving or receiving remuneration or benefits to secure the consent of a person who has control 
over that other person.’

It should be noted here that these means are irrelevant in the case of underage victims.36 Pro-
viding accommodation for a minor with the intention of exploitation, for instance, is human 
trafficking even if no force or other means is used.37 Force is also not required when a person 
is recruited, taken or abducted with the intention of inducing that person to make him or 
herself available to perform sexual acts with or for a third party for remuneration in another 
country (Article 273f (1) (3)).38

Coercion is effected by the use of any of the means listed in Article 273f (1) (1).
The case law includes examples of coercion (related to exploitation) – particularly in the sex 
industry.39 Exploitation implies a certain degree of involuntariness on the part of the person 
who is exploited, which lies in the impossibility of escaping from the situation of exploita-
tion.40 A person can be introduced to a situation of exploitation by means of coercion, but 
also prevented from leaving the situation. The consent of a victim of human trafficking to

tion of vulnerability is understood to refer to any situation in which the person involved has no real and ac-
ceptable alternative but to submit to the abuse involved’. Interpretative notes for the official records (travaux

the intended or actual exploitation is irrelevant if any of the means of coercion are used. This 
point of departure corresponds with the existing international instruments.41 The specified 
means are not part of the definition of the offence of human trafficking as it applies to mi-
nors, and consent is therefore never relevant in those cases.42

Where measures that directly restrict physical freedom are taken (for example, locking up 
or guarding a person), withdrawal is impossible in practice. When the exploiter uses other 
means to control the victim, the victim might in practice be able to escape, but his or her per-
ception of the situation might prevent it. The facts and circumstances must then show that 
victims could reasonably assume that they could not escape from the situation on their own. 
This might, for example, be due to the consequences (actual or perceived) of leaving or to the 
actual conditions under which the victim is staying or working.43 For example, the constraint 
might be found in a debt relationship with the employer or a third party, the cultural context, 
the fact that the person is a minor or a combination of these factors.NRM5

The district court in Leeuwarden, for example, found that by abusing the victim’s social situ-
ation, by constantly exerting pressure on her with the threat or use of physical violence and 
emotional blackmail and by providing her with a false identity document, the suspect had 
created a situation that induced the victim to continue working as a prostitute.44 The district 
court in Groningen convicted a suspect who had brought her victim under the influence of 
voodoo (among other things) of human trafficking.45 The fact that a person is addicted to 
narcotics might be a factor limiting that person’s freedom of choice and preventing him or 
her from escaping the exploitation.46 The fact that a person is not staying legally in the Neth-
erlands can also be regarded as a factor indicating exploitation of dependency and, there-
fore, abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs, according to the Supreme 
Court.47

41 See Article 1 (2) of the EU Framework Decision (2002) and Article 3 (b) of the UN Palermo Protocol. On the 
grounds of these provisions, the consent of the victim of human trafficking to the intended or actual exploi-
tation is irrelevant if one of the means of coercion is used. These provisions have not lead to explicit legisla-
tion; the explanatory memorandum shows that this was not felt to be necessary (Parliamentary Documents II 
2003/04, 29 291, no. 3, p. 19). 

42 See Article 273f (1) (2), (5) and (8) Dutch Criminal Code.
43 In this context, see also Arnhem Court of Appeal, 23 May 2006, LJN: AX4208, in which the court, in a case 

about sexual exploitation, found: “The possible consent to his/her exploitation is not decisive. Essential is 
whether under the given circumstances the victim has no reasonable choice but to be in a situation of exploi-
tation and voluntariness on the part of the victim is in fact lacking entirely or to a serious extent”.

ness [italics: BNRM] of the threat. She was an adolescent girl in a foreign land, unlawfully present in French 
territory and in fear of arrest by the police”.

The absence of consent can arise at a later stage, and also with respect to a person who is 
already working or planning to work in prostitution.48 For example, the district court in The 
Hague ruled that the vulnerable, isolated and dependent position of the victims had been 
abused, despite the fact that the women, from Eastern Europe, has started working in the 
sex industry to earn a lot of money and build a better life.49

It is, in fact, not a requirement that the means are used against the victim personally. A means 
can be used against a third party in order to persuade another person or to get another per-
son to yield to the will of the offender.

Table 11.5 presents a list of the forms of coercion actually used, as distilled from the convic-
tions. Combinations of different means of coercion can be used together.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

412

The most common form of violence used by suspects is ‘physical non-sexual violence’ (in 
41% of the judgments); ‘threat of violence’ was used in almost as many cases. ‘Psychological 
violence’ was declared proven in roughly one-fifth of the judgments, and ‘sexual violence’ in 
9% of the judgments.
In more than half of all judgments (55%), ‘control’ had been exercised over the victims by 
or through the offender. In this context, the victim might be accompanied to and from the 
work place so that he or she is never out alone or the victim might be called constantly dur-
ing working hours; it could include possessing the key to the victim’s home and checking 
the victim’s earnings. Almost equally often, victims are isolated from the outside world to 
a greater or lesser extent; examples of this include physically locking the victim up, creating 
social isolation and confiscating the victim’s telephone and passport. Controlling a victim is 
often accompanied by keeping him or her in isolation.
In 57% of the judgments, the suspects had used false pretences or ‘deception’,55 with regard 
to a loving relationship and a future together (in 22 judgments), the suspect’s financial posi-
tion (in 16 judgments), the working conditions (in 15) and/or the type of work (in 14).
In addition, in more than half of the judgments it emerged that the victims were ‘dependent’ 
on the offenders in various ways, for example for money (in 18 judgments), to gain entry to 
the Netherlands (in 13), for accommodation (in 13), for an identity document (in 10), for work 
(in 7) and/or for drugs (in 8). Establishing a situation of dependency for the victim resulted 
in the creation of ‘authority arising from the actual state of affairs’.
In almost one-third of all the judgments victims were in a ‘debt relationship’ to the exploiter. 
These usually involved debts connected with the trip or being smuggled to the Netherlands.
Seven judgments explicitly showed that there was ‘sale, gift and/or loan’ of a victim. In these 
cases, the victims were treated as property.

The means of coercion ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’, ‘abuse of authority arising from the 
actual state of affairs’ and ‘deception’, and the question of whether means of coercion should 
be considered separately or in combination with each other will be addressed further with a 
number of practical examples. The study has shown that there is still a great deal of uncer-
tainty on these points.

Abuse of a vulnerable position, authority arising from the actual state of affairs and deception
The means of coercion specified in Article 273f (1) (1) are based in part on international leg-
islation. Table 11.6 shows how the international instruments have been implemented in na-
tional legislation.

55 See Supreme Court, 2 October 2001, LJN: AB2806 (on the term ‘deception’) and Supreme Court, 8 Septem-
ber 2009, LJN: BJ3537, in which the Supreme Court found that the terms deception and abuse of a vulnerable 
position also have factual significance.

Examples of a ‘position of vulnerability’ to emerge from the accompanying documents to 
the Protocol and the Framework Decision include illegal or uncertain immigration or resi-
dence status, a minority position or circumstances such as sickness, pregnancy or a physical 
or mental handicap.58 For abuse of a vulnerable position, there does not have to be inequality 
in a relationship.59

The means ‘abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs’ has a broader scope 
than ‘abuse of power’ in the Protocol and ‘abuse of authority’ in the Framework Decision.60 
These means of coercion are objectified. ‘Abuse of authority arising from the actual state of 
affairs’ and ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’ are sometimes confused.61

56 Story (2009).
57 In the predecessor to Article 273f (1) (1) (Article 250a (old)) Dutch Criminal Code), the term ‘relationships’ 

was used instead of ‘circumstances’.
58 See, for example, Legislative Guide, p. 268 and COM (2000)854, §4.
59 Compare Noyon et al. (2006), Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code, note 3, supplement 137.
60 In the explanatory memorandum at the time of the introduction of Article 250ter (old) and 250bis (old) 

Dutch Criminal Code, for example, this means was explained as follows: this abuse is presumed when “the 
prostitute is in or enters a situation in which the circumstances are not the same as those that ought to apply 
for an articulate prostitute in the Netherlands”, Parliamentary Documents II 1988/89, 21 027, no. 3, p. 3-4.

61 During the period that ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’ was not included in the provisions of Dutch criminal 
law on human trafficking, conduct that would now fall under it was interpreted as ‘abuse of authority aris-
ing from the actual relationships’. Examples of this are that a person is addicted to narcotics or the fact that 
a person has no legal residence status in the Netherlands. In Supreme Court, 18 April 2000, NJ 2000, 443,

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

The case law yields a diverse range of examples addressing the question of which facts and 
circumstances create a situation of deception, abuse of authority arising from the actual 
state of affairs or abuse of a vulnerable position. The fact that it is often difficult to deter-
mine which category specific facts fall under is acknowledged in the conclusion of the PPS 
in a case before the Supreme Court, 8 September 2009,62 where it was noted that the term 
‘deception’ covers a diffuse array of conduct, facts and circumstances that have to be con-
sidered in relation to each other.63 The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling of the court of 
appeal in Arnhem64 that making a victim dependent by providing free cocaine, putting pres-
sure on her, bringing her to a place of prostitution, arranging a room and exercising control 
all give rise to exploitation by abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs and 
deception (Article 273f (1) (4) Dutch Criminal Code).

The District Court in Amsterdam65 regarded the fact that the suspect had falsely pretended that 
he wanted to build a future with the victim in Spain and the victim’s deep love for him consti-
tuted abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs. It was also taken into account 
that the suspect had made the same pretence with other women. On the other hand, the Dis-
trict Court in Den Bosch66 did not see such abuse where the suspect had told the victim that 
he had debts and that they could buy a house or nice clothes together, when the victim was in 
love with him.

The aspect of debt recurs in many cases of this type (involving loverboys) and seems to be 
used as a means of coercion. For the methods used by offenders, see §9.4, NRM3 and NRM5. 
It is no coincidence that a suspect starts to talk about debts and a future together and then 
suggests the possibility of prostitution. This is a pattern and has to be recognised as such. 
An example of recognising a pattern can be found in the following judgment by the court of 
appeal in Amsterdam.67

‘This case involves girls and young women who were brought into a position of emotional 
dependency by the suspect and his fellow suspects. The suspect and/or his fellow suspects 
formed a relationship with a woman, who was shown total love and devotion in the beginning 
and offered the prospect of a golden future with the suspect. Then – usually quite soon – a 
change occurred in the relationship, whereupon the woman was told by the suspect that, if she 
wanted to stay with him, she would have to provide the financial means – by prostituting her-
self. Once the woman had been brought into prostitution, she was then obliged to surrender 
all her earnings to the suspect and/or his fellow suspects, usually under the pretence that the 

consideration 3.3.1, these circumstances were described as abuse of authority arising from the actual rela-
tionships.

62 Supreme Court, 8 September 2009, LJN: BJ3537, advisory opinion of Advocate-General Vellinga.
63 The discussion of whether or not there was deception will therefore have to focus on whether deception has 

been proved and not whether deception was properly described in the indictment.

money would be saved for both of their futures. It is apparent both from statements by various 
complainants and from the transcripts of various tapped conversations that the suspect and/or 
his fellow suspects decided that a woman could only stop working for the day if she had earned 
a certain amount, just as it was also decided for her where and when she had to work. Acting 
in this way, the suspect and/or his accomplices therefore gained substantial authority over the 
women and/or deceived them. In these circumstances, there is no question whatever of an ‘ar-
ticulate prostitute’, as the legislature put it. The fact that some of the women involved in this 
case had worked previously as prostitutes does not detract from that. In the court’s opinion, 
the facts and circumstances declared proven constituted ‘abuse of authority arising from the 
actual state of affairs and/or deception’.

Although it is important to recognise a pattern, particularly in view of the rapid changes and 
modifications in the methods used by offenders – that must not lead to facts and circum-
stances being ‘checked off’ on the basis of one particular method, as in the case of the judg-
ments of the appeal court in Den Bosch68 and the district court in Utrecht that are discussed 
below,69 in which decisive significance was attached to the victims’ continuing contact with 
their family (hence no detachment) and continuing to go to school and the office.

The question of whether one or more means of coercion was used has to be answered first. 
Only after the existence of this objective situation of coercion has been established does the 
question arise of whether the victim had no other realistic choice. This issue is not dealt with 
uniformly, as the following examples show. The District Court in Den Bosch70 left open the 
question of whether there was a situation of coercion. However, without first establishing 
whether there was coercion, the question of whether the victim could have resisted it cannot 
be answered. That question is then, as it were, objectified.

The District Court in Amsterdam71 found on this point that the coercion does not necessarily 
have to consist of physical violence, threats or financial coercion, but can also arise because 
the victim finds herself in a situation of dependence in which, under the circumstances, she 
has no other choice but to enter or stay in a situation of exploitation. The means of coercion 
then constitutes abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs. The district court 
saw that abuse in the situation where (forming a relationship with the victim, telling her that he 
had large debts and that good money could be earned with prostitution, asking her to go into 
prostitution), the suspect, who was much older than the victim, had caused the victim to be in 
a situation of dependency. The court saw this as the suspect actively pushing the victim in the 
direction of prostitution and ruled that the victim was brought into a situation in which she 
was left with no other choice but to respect his wishes.72

72 The court acquitted on the elements of violence, while declaring proven ‘repeated striking, pushing and 

throwing against furniture, grabbing by the throat’. It is not clear from the judgment how the court saw this. 
Perhaps the proven violent acts were seen in the light of the authority.

The District Court in Den Bosch73 found that there might have been abuse of authority arising 
from the actual state of affairs or abuse of a vulnerable position, but nevertheless ruled that the 
victim was not in a situation where her freedom on choice was objectively limited or she could 
reasonably believe that she had to work in prostitution through the action of the suspect. The 
court also found that it could not be said that she was induced to make herself available for 
prostitution by acts of exploitation by the suspect.

The victim’s perception plays a role in the decision on whether he or she could reasonably 
have made any other choice.74

District Court in The Hague75

‘The violation of fundamental human rights – physical and mental integrity and personal free-
dom – is decisive. In deciding whether this was the case, the seriousness, duration and scale of 
the means of coercion and the economic benefit to be gained from the situation play a role. The 
victim’s consent to the situation is irrelevant, if any of the said means of coercion was used. The 
subjective perception [italics BNRM] may be a factor in determining whether the victim could 
have withdrawn from the suspect’s sphere of authority.’

The same line was also followed in the following case from the United States:

USA v. Timothy H. Bradley and Kathleen M. O’Dell, no. 04-1146, no. 04-1147, US Court of Appeals 
for the first circuit, 2004 U.S. App. Lexis 25174, Dec. 8, 2004 decided.
The court rejected an argument put forward by the defence that the workers were not forced 
to remain at work and that they could have fled to escape it with the finding that the point was 
whether the person in question could reasonably believe that there was compulsion to continue 
working,76 According to the court, that was the case.
This finding of the court corresponds with the (unpublished) reasoning of the district attorney 
in the case of Calimlin, who argued as follows: ‘The fact that Martinez may have had an op-
portunity to escape is irrelevant if the defendants, using one or more of the prohibited means 
discussed earlier, made Martinez reasonably believe that she could not leave or that she would 
suffer serious harm if she did so. A victim who reasonably believes she cannot leave is under 
no affirmative duty to try to escape. Bradley, 390 F.3d 145,153 (upholding jury instruction that 
government need not prove physical restraint, such as the use of chains, barbed wire, or locked 
doors to establish offense of forced labor; and the fact that the victim may have had the op-
portunity to flee is not determinative of the offense of forced labor if the defendants placed the 
victim in such fear or circumstances that he did not reasonably believe he could leave).’77

The fact that the victim herself says that working in prostitution was her own free choice also 
seems to play a role in the decision.78 Sometimes the victim’s statement that it was her free 
choice is not accepted. The District Court in Arnhem,79 for example, ruled that although the 
complainant declared that it was her own free choice to work in prostitution, the court did 
not believe it because the victim was under pressure from the suspect.
The existence or otherwise of free choice has to be seen in the light of the use of coercion. 
Especially in the case of deception, abuse of authority or of a vulnerable position, victims 
will often believe they made the choice themselves.
The question of whether a victim also has a more or less normal life seems to be another 
factor in assessing whether the victim had a reasonable alternative. For example, the Court 
of Appeal in Den Bosch80 ruled (in an obiter dictum) that in that context, it took into ac-
count the fact that the complainant had shown that at the time – although troubled – she 
was nevertheless capable of consciously making important choices, such as going to school 
to complete her education. The Court of Appeal could therefore not exclude the possibility 
that the complainant had seized on the suspect’s proposal in a carefully considered manner 
as an opportunity to leave home. At the same time, according to the court, she stated that 
when she started she regarded it as her own choice.81

In January 2008, the Court of Appeal in Den Bosch found that, in view of the legislative his-
tory and the UN Protocol and the terms of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code, a certain ini-
tiative and positive action on the part of the suspects is assumed, whereby conscious abuse 
is made of the weaker or vulnerable position of victims.82 Only if that is established can it be 
decided whether there was the intention of exploitation, according to the court of appeal. 
This was a case in which the charges were related to human trafficking in the hospitality 
sector. The public prosecution service has appealed to the Supreme Court in this case83 (for 
more on this case, see also §12.6).

The point of departure formulated by the Court of Appeal in Den Bosch has sometimes 
been followed subsequently in cases of human trafficking in the sex industry.84 The Court of 

78 The point of departure is that the consent of the victim is not relevant if means of coercion were used. See 
Article 1 (2) EU Framework Decision (2002) and Article 3 (b) of the UN Palermo Protocol. On the grounds 
of these provisions, the consent of a victim of human trafficking to the intended or actual exploitation is 
irrelevant if any of the means of coercion is used. These provisions have not lea to explicit legislation; the 
explanatory memorandum shows that this was not felt to be necessary (Parliamentary Documents II 2003/04, 
29 291, no. 3, p. 19).

81 See also Utrecht District Court, 29 May 2008, LJN: BD8803, in which case the fact that the victim had an

like the Den Bosch court of appeal, that in deciding whether there was use of coercion it has to be decided

418

Appeal in Den Bosch85 also feels that the terms of Article 273f make a certain initiative and 
positive action, together with conscious abuse of the victim’s vulnerable position, a condi-
tion with respect to sexual exploitation.
This condition does not automatically follow from the definition of the offence, and the 
question is whether the court of appeal is correct in stipulating that condition.

Should means of coercion be considered separately or as a whole?
Human trafficking often takes place in an environment of violence, threats and force. This 
violence (sexual or physical) is sometimes charged as a means of coercion in human traffick-
ing and sometimes as a separate offence and sometimes as violence used against another 
victim.86 It is important to consider the entire context in deciding whether there was human 
trafficking and to review the means of coercion in relation to each other.87

In a judgment of the District Court of The Hague,88 all means of coercion were assessed sepa-
rately. In this case, the court established that there was evidence that the victim had performed 
her work as a prostitute under the influence and pressure of the suspect and that the suspect 
had kept an eye on her, but the court did not consider the proven violence in connection with 
the human trafficking. The court also found it plausible that threats had been made but, again, 
did not make a connection with the human trafficking. Nor was the fact that the victim sur-
rendered the money she earned from prostitution relevant for the court. At the same time, the 
court found the separate charge of intentional deprivation of liberty with respect to the same 
victim to have been proved.
The District Court in Utrecht89 also regarded the violence used by the suspect against the victim 
as separate from the forced prostitution. The suspect was charged with forcing a victim into 
prostitution and keeping her there for more than two years (the charges were brought under 
Article 273f (1), (4) and (9)) and of assaulting or causing grievous bodily harm to the same vic-
tim for more than four years. The court found that the assault during this period (2003-2007) 
had been proved: the victim had been struck on the skull and the ears until she was bleeding 
from the ears, her legs had been kicked and she had been dragged by her hair. The court also 
found that it had been proved that the suspect had threatened the victim that if she left him, 

whether there was a certain initiative and positive action on the part of the suspect. The court declared in 
this case – in which the suspect was accused of recruiting women to work in prostitution in his escort com-
pany in the Netherlands in Hungarian newspapers – that offences under Article. 273f (1) (3) Dutch Criminal 
Code had been proved, but charges for the same set of facts under subsection (1) (9) (the women meanwhile 
worked for the suspect’s escort business and were living in the Netherlands illegally) led to acquittal since all 
the persons said they were working voluntarily and at their own initiative, which was apparently found to lie 
in the fact that the women had personally responded to the suspect’s advertisements. 

85 Den Bosch Court of Appeal, 15 April 2008, LJN: BI1162.
86 There are cases in which rapes, (serious) assaults and deprivation of liberty, besides being treated as means 

of coercion in charges for human trafficking offences, are also charged as separate offences. For example, in 
five judgments there were convictions for rape as a means of coercion. One of those cases was also the only 
case in which rape was charged as a separate offence as well as a means of coercion: Utrecht District Court, 
25 July 2007, LJN: BB0450. In this judgment, the rape as a means of coercion and the rape charged as a sepa-
rate offence were not the same rape; they were two rapes of two different victims.

she would never see her daughter again. Nevertheless, the court ruled that human trafficking 
had not been proved because it had not been proved that these means had induced the victim 
to make herself available for prostitution.
The District Court in The Hague90 also found, in acquitting suspects for human trafficking 
and convicting them for assault and uttering threats, that no direct connection had been es-
tablished between the violence used and the threats and the work in prostitution. The threat 
consisted of the words: ‘I am going to put my fist in your vagina and pull out your uterus’. The 
evidence showed that the complainant was pregnant and that the suspect had demanded she 
have abortion.

The picture to emerge from the almost 200 judgments since January 2007 that were studied 
is that Dutch prostitution policy still sometimes seems to play a role (even in judicial findings 
of fact on means of coercion) in decisions on whether a victim could reasonably have made 
a different choice. This is perhaps explicable on the grounds of the explanatory memoran-
dum91 to the original proposal for Article 273a of the old Dutch Criminal Code, in which the 
comparison was made with the ‘articulate Dutch prostitute’. However, that comparison can 
only refer to the situation where the prostitute was already working in prostitution, and can-
not be a factor in deciding on the ‘free choice’ to enter prostitution.92

11.3.5 The term ‘exploitation’

Human trafficking is actual or intended exploitation.93 Article 273f (2) Dutch Criminal Code 
gives a non-exhaustive list of what can constitute exploitation, but this list does not provide 
any clearly delineated, substantive criteria. In relation to the sex industry, the legislature and 
the Supreme Court refer to a situation of exploitation if the individual concerned is in a situ-
ation in which the conditions are not the same as those that an articulate prostitute in the 
Netherlands would enjoy.94 The nature of the work to be performed is very important in this 
interpretation. Forced employment in the sex industry is, by definition, exploitation, since 
the physical integrity of the victim is always affected.95

It is clear from the legislative history, which is based in part on the aforementioned interna-
tional instruments, that there is no requirement that exploitation actually took place.96

11.4 Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code in practice

In one of the 108 judgments in 2007 that were studied, charges were brought under Article 
250ter (1) (1) of the old Criminal Code. In 25 judgments, charges were brought under Article 
250a of the old Criminal Code. However, in most judgments (94 in total), offences were 
charged, solely or also, on the grounds of the relatively new provision of Article 273f Dutch 
Criminal Code.97

The application of Article 273f (1) raises quite a few problems in practice. A number of them 
are discussed below.

Jurisdiction
The point of departure for the Dutch rules on jurisdiction is the territoriality principle: Dutch 
criminal law applies to anyone who commits any criminal offence in the Netherlands.98

However, it is established jurispdrudence that if the offence was committed both in the Neth-
erlands and abroad, conduct that constitutes part of the criminal offence and takes place 
outside the Netherlands can also be prosecuted by virtue of Article 2 of the Dutch Criminal 
Code.99 This means that if only part of the offence is committed in the Netherlands, the en-
tire offence can be prosecuted in this country, quite apart from the question of whether the 
offences committed in the Netherlands can themselves be seen as separate offences, in the 
form of attempt, for example.
The Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings100 
contains a provision in which the obligation to establish jurisdiction, outside the territory 
of states, is formulated more broadly than it is in the current Dutch criminal legislation.101 
Given the nature of the offence of human trafficking, the government has proposed opting 
for the maximum scope of protection offered by the Convention. For this reason, it has pro-
posed, in accordance with the Convention,102 expanding jurisdiction on three points for the 
offences described in the Convention.103 For more information on this point, see §2.6.

97 It is possible that in one judgment several human trafficking offences were charged on the basis of different 
article numbers depending on the periods the offences were alleged to have been committed.

98 Article 2 Dutch Criminal Code. The Netherlands’ jurisdiction is regulated in Articles 2 to 8 Dutch Criminal 
Code.

99 Cleiren & Nijboer (2008), Article. 2 Dutch Criminal Code, note. 3c.
100 On this point, see also §3.5.1.
101 See Article. 31 of the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.
102 Article 31 (1) (a) to (c) requires that jurisdiction be established when the offence is committed in a country’s 

territory or on board a country’s ship or aircraft (Articles 2 and 3 Dutch Criminal Code). Article 31 (1) (d) re-
quires jurisdiction to be established for offences committed outside the country by a national of the country 
or a stateless person who has permanent residence or domicile in that country, if the offence is punishable 
under the law of the place where it was committed or the offence is committed outside the jurisdiction of any 
state. Article 31 (1) (e) obliges jurisdiction to be established for offences committed against a country’s own 
nationals. On the grounds of Article 45 of the Convention, the Netherlands may make a reservation to all or 
part of this provision. The Netherlands has said that it does not intend to make such reservation. See also 
§3.5.1.

Human trafficking does not have to be transnational, but it often is. Article 273f (1) (3) Dutch 
Criminal Code is transnational, by definition.104 It can cover recruitment abroad and exploi-
tation in this country, but also recruiting victims in this country and putting them to work 
abroad or, as in the Koolvis case,105 recruiting victims abroad (Nigeria) and exploiting them 
in prostitution, both here and in other European countries, via the Netherlands.
The District Court in Groningen106 pronounced a conviction under Article 273f (1) (3) with 
respect to Bulgarian women brought from Bulgaria to the Netherlands. The court declared 
that it was proven that the suspect had transported the victims from Bulgaria to the Neth-
erlands, but declared that the prosecution was inadmissible with regard to the conduct in 
Bulgaria due to the absence of jurisdiction. In view of the judicial finding of fact, the court’s 
decision with respect to the absence of jurisdiction is incorrect.

District court in Almelo (Sneep)107

‘Counsel has argued with respect to count 1 of the indictment concerning [woman 21] that the 
prosecution should be declared inadmissible, since the suspect does not have Dutch national-
ity and the court has no jurisdiction with respect to the elements of charge 1 that took place 
abroad.
The court does not share this view. On the grounds of Article 2 of the Dutch Criminal Code, 
Dutch criminal law applies to anyone who commits a criminal offence in the Netherlands. The 
suspect is charged with human trafficking in count 1, which, in the court’s opinion, insofar as 
it relates to one and the same victim must be regarded as a single continuous offence that was 
committed by a combination of acts in various places. With respect to [woman 21], the suspect 
is accused of various acts carried out in the commission of human trafficking that took place 
both in the Netherlands and in Belgium. If places in the Netherlands as well as outside can also 
be deemed to be places where the offence was committed, on the grounds of said article that of-
fence may be prosecuted in the Netherlands, even with respect to the acts constituting the part 
of the offence that took place outside the Netherlands. The defence is therefore rejected.
With respect to the separate charge of assault of [woman 21] charged under count 3, the court 
finds that this charge relates to a separate offence, the acts in the commission of which took place 
exclusively in Belgium. The court therefore has no jurisdiction and the public prosecutor is there-
fore declared inadmissible in the prosecution of count 3, insofar as it relates to [woman 21].’

The striking of the victim (woman 21) was charged both as a means of coercion and as a 
separate offence. The violence was, in any case, the context in which the human trafficking 
took place (see §11.3. The striking of the victim (woman 21) does not appear in the judicial 
finding of fact. If the striking in the charges for human trafficking would have been the same 
as the striking in the charges for assault, the connection with the human trafficking offence 
could perhaps have created jurisdiction. The court acquitted on the charge of participation 
in a criminal organisation. Both the human trafficking offences and the assault were charged

in that context, so if the membership of the criminal organisation had been declared proven, 
the result would have been different.108

Charges
It is not easy to bring charges under Article 273f. The description of the facts of the criminal 
conduct often show a series of acts that could (successively) fall under subsections (1), (4) 
and (9)109 but, nevertheless, a choice is made to bring charges of criminal behaviour under 
just one of the subsections.
The distinction between subsection (1) and subsection (4), in particular, often causes prob-
lems. For example, charges are often brought under subsection (1) when the description of 
the facts shows that subsection (4) would support a completed offence.
The acts and the means of coercion are sometimes confused.

District Court in The Hague110

‘In the court’s opinion, the public prosecutor has classified a number of factual details under an 
incorrect heading. For example, allowing a person to remain in the Netherlands without a valid 
residence permit is more part of the means of coercion ‘abuse of authority arising from the ac-
tual state of affairs’ than the exploitation itself, while employing a person in the household for 
long days for a small remuneration is in fact an element of exploitation. Since the court is not 
bound by the public prosecutor’s qualification, the court will decide whether the offences actu-
ally charged can be proved. Insofar as they are proved, the court will qualify them as it deems 
correct. The formulation of this article of the law does, in fact, lead to confusion.’

The aggravating circumstances are not always explicitly mentioned111 (see §11.5).

The following example illustrates the importance of the choices made in bringing the charges.

District Court in Zutphen,112

This was a judgment in which women were working in the escort sector and in which that work 
and the circumstances under which it was performed were assessed as though it was a case of 
‘other forms of exploitation’.113 The case involved two women from Brazil who had worked in 
the suspects’ escort company at different periods. In addition to a number of forms of human 
trafficking, people smuggling was also charged.

The court acquitted on human trafficking and convicted for people smuggling. The court found 
the following facts had been proved:
That the suspect

 – ordered the tickets for the journey from (place) in Brazil to Amsterdam and back from a 
travel agent; and

 – paid for the tickets for the trip and sent them to (victim B); and
 – collected (victim B) from the airport; and
 – provided shelter and accommodation for (victim B); and
 – bought clothing and lingerie for (victim B); and
 – explained to (victim B) about the escort business; and
 – under the name (name A) placed advertisements on the internet and in newspapers for es-

cort services with an accompanying telephone number; and
 – if clients ordered a girl, provided information and caused information to be provided (by 

telephone) to the clients; and
 – if a client ordered a girl, noted and checked the address of that client; and
 – instructed (victim B) to work as a prostitute/escort; and
 – transported (victim B) and arranged for her to be transported to and from clients; and
 – provided condoms and sponges; and
 – received the money that (victim B) earned with the escort (between €125 and €150); and
 – gave €30 and/or €35 of that earned money as basic earnings to (victim B); and
 – informed (victim B) that she must be available to work everyday

What is immediately striking is that the public prosecution service chose not to bring charg-
es under Article 273f (1) (3), but under Article 273f (1) (1), alternatively (4). Article 273f (1) (1) 
and (4) can also very easily be charged together. A conviction on the grounds of Article 273f 
(1) (3) would have been inevitable, on the basis of the judicial finding of fact set out above. It 
is also noteworthy that the indictment with respect to the principal charge was not based on 
the fact that the intended exploitation was for the purpose of exploitation in prostitution. 
Exploitation in prostitution is, by definition, exploitation. Terms of employment and work-
ing conditions such as earnings and accommodation are irrelevant in that case. And work-
ing as an escort is prostitution. Perhaps the fact that this was not charged as exploitation in 
prostitution wrong-footed the court. There was also no prosecution under Article 273f (1) 
(9), even though the aforementioned judicial finding of fact provides sufficient grounds for 
one.

The court explained the acquittal on the charge of human trafficking as follows:114

‘First and foremost, the court finds that it is a socially undesirable labour situation, when 
women, who are in a socially or economically difficult position in their own country, are 
convinced by another person to work in a distant country as escorts in that other person’s 
company.’

114 The indictment relating to victim B covered several periods; the handing of this case was limited to the first

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

424

The court described this as an undesirable labour situation, even though it falls directly un-
der the description in Article 273f (1) (3) and is therefore human trafficking.115 It concerns, 
after all, prostitution. The court also found:
‘That fact, however, does not in itself mean that women were, in an unacceptable manner, 
restricted in their freedom of action and choice and employed under unacceptable condi-
tions, to such an extent that there was exploitation. This depends on the particular facts and 
circumstances of the case.’
With respect to the use of means of coercion the court found:
‘The fact that the suspect and fellow suspect manifestly exerted pressure on (victim B) and 
(victim A) to be available from a particular time (18.00) and to work when they were physi-
cally unwell, cannot in itself be described as coercion. The fact that the suspect and (fellow 
suspect) threatened to inform the families of (victim B) that she was working as an escort, 
perhaps exerted moral pressure on the complainant, but this cannot be regarded as being 
such that for that reason she was unable to offer resistance to what the suspect and fellow 
suspect expected of her.’116

The facts often lead to charges being brought under several subsections, and sometimes the 
decision to limit the charges to one or two subsections seems arbitrary.
The difference between the offences under Article 273f (1) (1) and (4) lies more in the fact 
that for charges under subsection (1) it is not necessary that the victim was induced to make 
herself available for prostitution. If the means of coercion, the conduct and the intention are 
established, every element of the offence has been met. Intention of exploiting in prostitu-
tion is adequately factually described (see §11.4.1). It was otherwise in the District Court in 
Utrecht117 in a case in which charges were brought under Article 273f (1) (1) and (4) and (9). 
The court found that it was not proved that the victim was induced to make herself avail-
able for prostitution and also discussed whether the victim could have made another choice. 
However, that is irrelevant for charges under subsection 1. Nevertheless, the court acquitted 
on all charges.

Table 11.7 shows how many of the judgments that were analysed included charges that were 
brought under the different subsections and in how many of the convictions the charges un-
der the subsections were declared proven. The different categories are not mutually exclu-
sive, since charges are regularly brought under combinations of different subsections and 
declared proven.

115 No charges were brought under Article 273f (1) (3) Dutch Criminal Code, however.

state of affairs and deception’ and ‘means of coercion considered separately or as a whole’ in §11.3.4.

The following sections discuss how the different subsections of the article are applied in 
practice. Since charges are usually brought under several subsections, which are therefore 
applied together, the distinction is not always straightforward.

11.4.1 Subsection 1

Art. 273f (1) (1) reads:
‘Any person who:
by force, violence or other act, by the threat of violence or other act, by extortion, fraud, 
deception or the misuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs, by the misuse of 
a vulnerable position or by giving or receiving remuneration or benefits in order to obtain 
the consent of a person who has control over this other person recruits, transports, moves, 
accommodates or shelters another person, with the intention of exploiting this other person 
or removing his or her organs;’

Table 11.7 shows that in a large majority (67) of the judgments that were analysed, charges 
were brought under subsection (1). In more than half (38) of the analysed judgements that led 
to at least a conviction for human trafficking, the charges under subsection (1) were declared 
proved. In at least118 29 judgments, the courts acquitted on at least one offence charged under 
subsection (1).

Background to the criminal provision described in subsection 1
The prohibited acts are derived from the UN Protocol on trafficking in human beings (2000) 
and the EU Framework Decision on trafficking in human beings (2002). These are activities 
designed to achieve the ultimate objective of exploitation. Recruiting, transporting, moving, 

118 It is possible that in the 38 judements in which at least one offence under subsection (1) (among others) was 
declared proven, the suspects were also acquitted for another offence charged under subsection (1).

accommodating and sheltering have to be interpreted in accordance with normal everyday 
speech, on the one hand, but also have to be construed in accordance with the desire to tackle 
human trafficking as broadly as possible, on the other. Giving the terms a limited and purely 
literal interpretation is not reconcilable with that intention.119

District Court in Amsterdam120

The indictments in this case were not published;121 however, it is possible to conclude from the 
judicial findings that charges were brought under Article 273f (1) (1) and (9). The court acquit-
ted on the charges under subsection (1) and stated, in that context, that it had taken into ac-
count the desire arising from the Protocol on trafficking in human beings not to interpret the 
term recruitment and the terms transport, move, accommodate and shelter in a limited and 
literal sense. The court found that it had not been proved that the suspect had recruited the 
victims with the intention of exploitation. The suspect was purely intent on securing financial 
gain by manipulating the situation in which the victims found themselves rather than creating 
the the situation for them or persuading to them to enter it, according to the court. The court 
did convict on the grounds of subsection (9). According to the judicial finding of fact, the court 
found that it had been proved that ‘the suspect determined the waiting times’, ‘the victim had 
to ask permission if she had to stop her work as a prostitute’ and ‘the suspect made her work 
longer if she had not earned enough’.

It is not clear why the public prosecutor did not also choose to bring charges under subsec-
tion (4).
In its decision, the court took into account the fact that the victims were already working in 
prostitution voluntarily and that it was not the suspect who had brought them into prostitu-
tion. In principle, that is irrelevant even for Article 273f (1) (1), especially since it is clear from 
the judgment that the suspect prevented the victim from leaving prostitution.122 Apparently, 
the court felt that this was relevant for a conviction under Article 273f (1) (1). The question is 
whether the court would have convicted under subsection (4) if charges had also been based 
on that subsection.

The conduct must be for the purpose of exploitation. The exploitation itself does not have to 
have taken place. The intention is then shown by the events that have been declared proven.123

suspect in prostitution.’

123 Alkmaar District Court, 26 July 2006, LJN: AY5332. The court declared the summons null and void because 
the intention of exploitation in prosititution did not comply with Article 261 Dutch Criminal Code without a 
further elaboration of the facts of the ‘exploitation’ in the indictment. The Supreme Court (Supreme Court, 
9 September 2006, LJN: AX9215), however, did find the term ‘sexual acts’ to be an adequate factual descrip-
tion.

In the convictions, the term ‘exploitation’ is usually elaborated in terms of forced prostitu-
tion or the confiscation of earnings. In 11 judgments, the judicial finding of fact also explicitly 
refers to a confiscation of earnings.

11.4.2 Subsection 3

Art. 273f (1) (3) reads as follows:
‘any person who recruits, takes with him or abducts a person with the intention of inducing 
that person to make himself/herself available for performing sexual acts with or for a third 
party for remuneration in another country’.

Table 11.7 shows that in one-third (36) of the analysed judgments in 2007, charges were 
brought under subsection (3). In almost one-third (22) of the judgments that led to at least a 
conviction for human trafficking, the offences under subsection (3) were declared proven. In 
at least124 14 judgments, the court acquitted on at least once offence charged under subsec-
tion (3).

Table 11.8 shows that a surprising number of judgments involved victims from Romania. 
The country of destination for all the foreign victims (divided among 33 indictments and 19 
judicial findings of fact) was the Netherlands; for the three Dutch victims, it was Belgium.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

428

Background to the criminal provision described in subsection (3)
Article 273f (1) (3) Dutch Criminal Code is a provision that transposes an obligation arising 
from the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age 
signed in Geneva in 1933 into Dutch criminal legislation.126 That convention required states 
to criminalise the recruitment of adult women if it was done with the intention of commit-
ting indecent acts in another country, ‘even with their consent.127 Consequently, whether it 
is voluntary or not is irrelevant, since there is no element of coercion in this provision. The 
recruitment of a person in another country (including an EU country) for prostitution is 
punishable, even if the person recruited consents to it.
In general, these criminal acts are difficult to demonstrate, as the explanatory memorandum 
to the amending law in 1994 stated:128 ‘The legislature therefore does not seem to expect 
much more from this provision than to comply with an international treaty obligation.’ Nev-
ertheless, practice shows that prosecutions are brought relatively frequently under Article 
273f (1) (3) (see Table 11.7).129

Several elements of the offence have been further explained by the legislature or the courts. 
In light of the legislative history, the intention was to provide extensive protection to the 
victim of actions that are criminalised by the provision. The Supreme Court has therefore 
construed the terms ‘recruits’ and ‘takes’ quite loosely. ‘Recruit’ is any act by which a person 
is recruited for the purpose of bringing that person into prostitution in another country, 
without the need to show that the method of recruitment limited the person’s freedom of 
choice.130 ‘Taking’ could be proved in a human trafficking case, even when the victim has 
travelled alone to the Netherlands. The victim in that case would have been ‘enticed to the 
Netherlands under false pretences and forced to work in prostitution there’.131 The ticket was 
paid for by an accomplice and the victim was collected from the airport in the Netherlands 
by the suspect and an accomplice.132

126 This Convention was originally implemented in Article 250a (1) (2) (old) Dutch Criminal Code.
127 See also Gerritsma & Wijers (2003).
128 Parliamentary Documents II 1988/89, 21 027, no. 3, p. 9.
129 A reservation that need to be made about the provision is that this ban on ‘transnational recruitment’ ham-

pers access to the legal Dutch prostitution markt for nationals of other member states (forms of labour that 
do not involve sexual acts in fact fall outside the scope of this offence), which is in violation of Community 
law (Gerritsma & Wijers, 2003).

Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code, note 3, supplement 137 – sheltering must be interpreted broadly.
132 As regards the taking or abduction of persons, reference can also be made to the possibilities offered by 

Article 278 Dutch Criminal Code, since the Supreme Court has ruled that not only the ‘export’ but also 
the ‘import’ of persons can fall under it (Cleiren & Nijboer, 2008, p. 1191, referring to Supreme Court, 20 
November 2001, LJN: AB2809; LJN: AB2810). The abduction of persons to the Netherlands with the inten-
tion of unlawfully surrendering them to the power of another person or rendering them helpless and putting 
them to work in the sex industry, for example, can also fall under abduction. Article 278 Dutch Criminal 
Code provides for a maximum prison sentence of 12 years.

Case law on exploitation in the sex industry

Several applications of the criminal provision described in subsection (3)
This section contains a number of judgments concerning Article 273f (1) (3). The most note-
worthy is the judgment of the District Court in Maastricht133 (which was followed by the 
District Court in Leeuwarden134). The suspect was charged under Article 273f (1) (3), alter-
natively under subsection (9), and, as a separate offence, under subsection (6). The court 
acquitted the suspect on all charges. Insofar as it is relevant here, the court found:
‘In the Netherlands, however, not every form of prostitution is punishable. The point of 
departure of Dutch policy with respect to exploitation of prostitution is that criminal law 
instruments must be used to tackle forms of exploitation where economic profit is secured 
in an illegitimate manner from the exploitation or the person concerned is not always com-
pletely free to decide whether to perform the sexual acts, can refuse to do so and can also 
stop entirely.’
The court establishes a link here with Dutch prostitution policy.

To the contrary: District Court in The Hague135

The aforementioned judgment of the District Court in Maastricht was invoked in this case. 
The court rejected this defence, finding that Article 273f (1) (3) does not require force or unlaw-
ful influence. The simple recruitment of persons with the intention that they will make them-
selves available for prostitution is an act that is made an offence under that article.

Another example of the application in practice of this subsection is given in the box below.

District Court in Haarlem136

In three cases, the court acquitted on the alternative charges brought under Article 273f (1) (3), 
with the following reasoning:
‘With respect to the implicit alternative charges under count 1, the court finds that, in its 
opinion, it is inherent to the term ‘induce’ that there must be a situation in which the suspect 
and/or accomplices abuse the victim’s situation, as a result of which the victim is induced 
to make herself available to perform sexual acts. On the grounds of the evidence in the file 
before it, the court is of the opinion that it does not follow from that evidence, apart from 
the statement of the victim herself, that the suspect and accomplices had the intention of 
inducing the victim to make herself available to perform sexual acts. For example, there is 
no evidence in the file of actions on the part of the suspect and/or accomplices by which the 
victim was induced, or at least to show by which actions the victim was convinced to start 
working as a prostitute.’

430

The court here formulates an additional requirement that does not follow from the descrip-
tion of the offence, since the use of means of coercion is not included in the definition of the 
offence in Article 273f (1) (3).
These examples show that this subsection is not applied uniformly. Convictions under Arti-
cle 273f (1) (3) followed in 22 of the 36 cases.

11.4.3 Subsection 4

Article 273f (1) (4) reads:
‘the person who forces or induces another person by the means referred to under 1 to make 
himself/herself available for performing work or services or making his/her organs available 
or takes any action in the circumstances referred to under 1 which he knows or may reason-
ably be expected to know will result in that other person making himself/herself available for 
performing labour or services or making his/her organs available’.

Table 11.7 shows that in roughly one-third (34) of the analysed judgments in 2007 charges 
were brought under subsection (4). In almost one-third (22) of the judgments that led to 
at least a conviction for human trafficking, the charges under subsection (4) were declared 
proven. In at least137 12 judgments, the court acquitted on at least one offence charged under 
subsection (4).

Background to the criminal provision described in subsection (4)
For punishment of an offence under this subsection, it is not relevant whether the labour or 
service was actually performed. The Supreme Court ruled that ‘for punishability (…) it is 
not necessary that any sexual act was actually performed. What is decisive is that the victim 
made herself available to do so under coercion or influence.’138 This subsection covers any act 
that causes the other person to be in a situation where he or she makes him or herself availa-
ble.139 Such acts include, for example, any act aimed at a woman who has voluntarily engaged 
in prostitution with the effect of preventing her from freely stopping.140

The relationship between the ‘inducing’ in subsection (4) and the means of coercion used is 
discussed further in §11.3.4.
The element ‘knows or may reasonably be expected to know’ in this provision actually en-
compasses both intent and culpa. When the suspect knows that ‘as a result the other person 
will make himself/herself available for performing […]’, there is intent and when the suspect 

137 It is possible that in the 22 judgments in which at least one offence under subsection (4) (among others) was 
declared proven, the suspect was also acquitted of another offence charged under subsection (4).

138 Supreme Court, 19 September 2006, LJN: AX9215. This judgment was based on Article 250a (1) (1) Dutch

‘may reasonably be expected to know [the act] will result in the other person making him-
self/herself available for performing (…)’, it is culpa.141

11.4.4 Subsection 6

Article 273f (1) (6) reads as follows:
‘the person who wilfully profits from the exploitation of another person’.

Table 11.7 shows that in almost one-fifth (20) of the analysed judgments, charges were brought 
under subsection (6). In an equally large proportion of the convictions (14), the charges un-
der subsection (6) were declared proven. In at least142 seven judgments, the court acquitted 
on at least one offence charged under subsection (6).

Article 273f (1) (6) up to and including (9) make various forms of profiting from human traf-
ficking an offence. When profiting from sexual exploitation was inserted in Article 250a of 
the old Criminal Code, it was said that a separate criminal offence of profiting was felt to 
be necessary, since it was not certain whether the provisions on participation provided suf-
ficient protection.143

The person profiting may be, but does not necessarily have to be, a different person to the 
person who has created the situation of exploitation.144

The District Court in Maastricht145 found in a case in which charges were brought under 
Article 273f (1) (6) that, for the offence to be declared proven, it was necessary for the suspect 
to have exploited the victim and that he also intended to exploit her. The court found that that 
had not been proved and acquitted the suspect. However, personal exploitation and intent 
to exploit are not requirements for subsection (6). The intent in subsection (6) has to be di-
rected at profiting. The court probably meant that it had not been established that the victim 
was exploited, which is required for a conviction under Article 273f (1) (6).

11.4.5 Subsection 9

Article 273f (1) (9) reads as follows:
‘the person who forces or induces another person by the means referred to under 1 to provide 
him with the proceeds of that person’s sexual acts with or for a third party or of the removal 
or that person’s organs.’

141 The intent and the culpa in Article 273f (1) (5) Dutch Criminal Code do not have to concern the fact that 
the victim has not yet reached the age of 18, see Parliamentary Documents II 1996/97, 25 437, no. 3, p. 9. This 
means that the offender does not have to know the age of the victim.

142 It is possible that in the 14 judgments in which at least one offence under subsection (6) (among others) was 
declared proven, the suspect was also acquitted of another offence under subsection (6).

This provision also applies with respect to underage victims; Article 273f contains no sepa-
rate provision with respect to this act applicable to victims who have not yet reached the age 
of 18 (as is the case with subsections (2) and (5) in relation to subsection (1) and subsection 
(4) respectively).

Table 11.7 shows that charges were brought under subsection 9 in roughly one-fifth (23) of the 
analysed judgments. In roughly the same proportion of the convictions (16), offences under 
subsection (9) were declared proven. In at least146 seven judgments, the court acquitted on at 
least one offence charged under subsection (9).

For a conviction under Article 273f (1) (9), as with subsection (1), it is not necessary for the 
victim to have been induced by the suspect to make herself available for prostitution. The 
establishment of the means of coercion in relation to inducing the provision of the proceeds 
from the prostitution is sufficient. In that sense, this subsection is easier to prove.

11.4.6 Subsection (2), (5) and (8) (underage victims)

If the victim is underage, the situation is regarded as human trafficking even without the use 
of coercion.

Article 273f (1) (2):
‘any person who recruits, transports, accommodates or shelters a person with the intention 
of exploiting that other person or removing his or her organs, when that person has not yet 
reached the age of eighteen years’.

Article 273f (1) (5):
‘any person who induces another person to make himself/herself available for performing sex-
ual acts with or for a third party for remuneration or to make his or her organs available for re-
muneration or takes any action towards another person which he knows or may reasonably be 
expected to know that this will result in that other person making himself/herself available for 
performing these acts or making his/her organs available for remuneration, when that other 
person has not yet reached the age of eighteen years’.

Article 273f (1) (8):
‘any person who willfully profits from the sexual acts of another person with or for a third 
party for remuneration or the removal of that person’s organs for remuneration, when this 
other person has not yet reached the age of eighteen years’.

Table 11.7 shows that in roughly one-third (37) of the analysed judgments, charges were 
brought under subsection 2, 5 and/or 8. In almost one-third (24) of the convictions, the 

146 It is possible that in the 16 judgments in which at least one offence under subsection (9) (among others) was 
declared proven, the suspect was also acquitted of another offence under subsection (9).

charges under subsection (2), (5) and/or (8) were declared proven. In at least147 13 judg-
ments, the court acquitted on at least one offence charged under subsection (2), (5) and/or 
(8). The intent and the culpa in Article 273f (1) (2), (5) and (8) do not have to be directed at 
the fact that the victim has not yet reached the age of 18 years (see also Parliamentary Docu-
ments II 1996/97, 25 437, no. 3, p. 9). This means that the offender does not have to know the 
age of the victim. As already mentioned, there is no variant of subsection (9) for underage 
victims.

11.5 Aggravating circumstances

Article 250ter (old), Article 250a (old), Article 273a (old) and Article 273f Dutch Criminal 
Code all make provision for aggravating circumstances. The sentences for human traffick-
ing were increased as of 1 July 2009 (see §2.2 and Appendix 1) as follows:

 – In the first subsection (unqualified forms of human trafficking), the maximum sentence 
was increased form six to eight years.

 – In the third subsection (human trafficking committed by two or more persons acting in 
concert or human trafficking committed in respect of a victim younger than 16), the maxi-
mum sentence was increased from eight to twelve years.

 – In the fifth subsection (human trafficking with the aggravating circumstance of resulting 
in serious physical injury or threatening the life of another person), the maximum sen-
tence was increased from 12 to 15 years.

 – In the sixth subsection (human trafficking resulting in death), the maximum sentence was 
increased from 15 to 18 years.

Because the sentence was increased for both aggravating circumstances in the third section 
of the article, the fourth section lapsed. Until 1 July 2009 , this provision fixed the maximum 
sentence at 10 years for human trafficking committed by two or more persons acting in con-
cert and with respect to a victim younger than 16.

Table 11.9 shows the proportion of the human trafficking judgments that were analysed in 
which the various aggravating circumstances were charged, as well as the number of con-
victions in which the different aggravating circumstances were declared proven. Naturally, 
these are not mutually exclusive categories, since it is possible that different aggravating cir-
cumstances had been charged and found proven in the same judgment, if only because more 
than one offence is often charged and declared proven. All that can be stated on the basis 
of Table 11.9, therefore, is that aggravating circumstances had been charged in a minimum

The aggravating circumstances presented in the table are discussed in §11.5.1 to §11.5.

11.5.1 In concert (co-perpetration)

Table 11.9 shows that ‘human trafficking committed by two or more persons acting in con-
cert’, pursuant to Article 250ter/a (2) (1) (old) and Article 273a/f (3) (1) Dutch Criminal Code, 
was charged in almost three-quarters (80=74%) of the analysed judgments. In relative terms 
– on the basis of the convictions – this aggravating circumstance was declared proven slight-
ly less often (52 times=70%). In at least149 28 judgments, the court acquitted on at least one 
offence in which the aggravating circumstance ‘in concert’ was charged.

11.5.2 Victim younger than 16

Table 11.9 shows that ‘human trafficking involving a victim who is under the age of 16’, pursu-
ant to Article 250ter/a (2) (2) (old) and Article 273a/f (3) (2) Dutch Criminal Code, was never 
charged, but was declared proven in one judgment.150 That was also the case for the combi-
nation of aggravating circumstances ‘human trafficking in concert with respect to a victim 

148 Article 250ter/a (3) (old) Dutch Criminal Code can cover both the combination of ‘in concert’ and ‘victim 
younger than 16’ and the combination ‘in concert’ and ‘serious physical injury’. Since neither Article 250ter 
(3) (old) Dutch Criminal Code nor Article 250a (3) (old) Dutch Criminal Code appears in the indictments in 
the analysed judgments in 2007– and therefore also not in the judicial findings of fact – that has no influence 
on the data presented here.

149 It is possible that in the 52 judements in which at least one offence under the aggravating circumstance ‘in 
concert’ was declared proven, the suspect was also acquitted of another offence that was charged under 
(among others) the aggravating circumstance ‘in concert’.

who is under the age of 16’, pursuant to Article 250ter/a (3) (old) and Article 273a/f (4) Dutch 
Criminal Code.151 This aggravating circumstance was declared proven twice, although it had 
not been charged.152

Notably, in 11 judgments at least one victim was under the age of 16 at the time of the human 
trafficking offences charged.153 In those cases, the aggravating circumstance of ‘human traf-
ficking with respect to a victim who is under the age of 16’ was not explicitly charged.

District Court in Rotterdam154

This case concerned human trafficking involving a victim who was under the age of 16. The in-
dictment on this point read – insofar as it is relevant – that the suspect, during a certain period 
in municipality X, in implementation of the suspect’s intended offence of inducing another 
person to make herself available for performing one or more sexual acts with or for a third 
party for remuneration, ‘while that other person had not yet reached the age of 18’ (Article 
273f (1) (5) Dutch Criminal Code). The aggravating circumstance – the fact that the victim 
was under the age of 16 – was not explicitly mentioned or even described as an aggravating 
circumstance.

In 24 judgments, at least one victim was a minor at the time of the human trafficking offences 
charged – perhaps older than 16, but in any case younger than 18. At this moment, a human 
trafficking offence committed with respect to an underage person (between the ages of 16 
and 18) is not yet an aggravating circumstance. This could change in the future.
The aggravating circumstances were expanded in March 2009 in the European Commis-
sion’s proposal for a new EU Framework Decision on trafficking in human beings.155 Ac-
cording to the Commission, by means of aggravating circumstances, account must be taken 
of the need to protect particularly vulnerable victims, which include children.156 The fact that 
the offence is committed with respect to a particularly vulnerable victim is an aggravating 
circumstance. A child is, by definition, a vulnerable victim, and in the proposal a child is de-
fined as any person under the age of 18. Like the current EU Framework Decision (2002), the 
proposal does not in fact contain any obligation for national judges to actually apply these 
circumstances in determining the sentence.
The aggravating circumstance that is based on the age of sexual majority (16 in the Nether-
lands) is not relevant for human trafficking, either in the sex industry or in any other sector.157

The applicable age for the aggravating circumstance that is currently included in Article 273f 
Dutch Criminal Code could now already be changed to 18. ECPAT International and the 
Kinderrechtencollectief have, in fact, stated earlier that the aggravating circumstance in the 
human trafficking provision should be expanded to cover minors (persons under the age of 
18), where sexual exploitation is involved.158

11.5.3 Serious physical injury, threatening the life of another person or 
resulting in death

Article 250ter/a (2) (3) (old) and Article 273a/f (5) Dutch Criminal Code159 (human traffick-
ing resulting in serious physical injury) or, in the case of Article 273a/f (5), human trafficking 
that threatens the life of another person, and Article 273a/f (6) (human trafficking resulting 
in death), do not appear in the indictments in the analysed judgments.

This does not mean that human trafficking committed under these aggravating circum-
stances – particularly resulting in serious physical injury and threatening the life of another 
person – could not have been charged and might possibly have been declared proven in the 
judgments that were analysed. One example is a case in which a suspect was charged with 
eight offences, including attempted manslaughter, an attempt to cause serious bodily harm 
and two human trafficking offences. These four offences were committed with respect to the 
same victim and were all declared proven in first instance.160 A number of the facts that were 
charged and declared proven (which constituted part of the four offences that were declared 
proven) are listed below.

District Court in Utrecht161

With respect to the attempted manslaughter of victim A the defendant, among other things:
 – (repeatedly) squeezed the victim’s throat with force and kept squeezing it and then pushed 

the victim against the wall and pushed her up by the throat until the victim lost conscious-
ness, and then kicked the victim’s body until she regained consciousness;

 – placed a large knife against the victim’s throat and then cut the victim’s arm and wrist with 
the knife.

With respect to the attempt to cause serious bodily harm to victim A the suspect, among other 
things:

 – repeatedly beat/kicked the victim in the face and/or nose with force;
 – kicked the victim’s body with his foot with force;
 – put out a burning cigarette on the victim’s knee and/or (upper) leg and/or (lower) leg;
 – head-butted the victim in the nose;
 – stabbed/cut the victim’s leg with a knife and/or then poured vinegar and/or chlorine into/

over the bleeding wound.
With respect to the two human trafficking offences with respect to victim A, the suspect used 
means of coercion consisting of the fact that the suspect, among other things:

 – arranged for tattoos to be placed on her (right) upper arm and left breast;
 – systematically assaulted the victim and/or held a heated skewer, or at least a heated object, 

against the bottom of her bare foot;
 – told the pregnant victim that she had to have an abortion and/or exerted pressure on her and/

or induced her to have an abortion.

The separately charged attempted manslaughter and attempt to cause grievous bodily harm 
that were found proven both took place during a four-and-a-half year period in which the 
victim was in a situation of exploitation. These two offences could therefore also be regarded 
as means of coercion in the two human trafficking offences charged, which could have pro-
duced human trafficking that threatens the life of another person. It is possible to charge 
one and the same offence – the attempted manslaughter, for example – not only as a separate 
offence but also as a means of coercion – and as an aggravating circumstance.
It is also noteworthy that the means of coercion that were actually proved could also have 
yielded the aggravating circumstance in Article 273f (5), but it was neither charged nor ruled 
on. Under certain circumstances, inducing a person to be tattooed can be regarded as caus-
ing serious physical injury.162 Human traffickers regularly tattoo their victims (see §9.4.4). 
In the Sneep case, forcing or inducing a person to have an abortion did lead to a charge and 
conviction for the aggravating circumstance described in the subsection (5). The grounds for 
sentencing in this case included the following.

District Court in Almelo (Sneep)163

‘The court has also considered whether there was rape, forced breast enlargement, abortion as 
a statutory aggravating circumstance, the role that the suspect played in the events and possible 
recidivism’ (italics: BNRM).

Article 82 of the Dutch Criminal Code contains a number of examples of ‘serious bodily 
harm’ (‘serious physical injury’ in the words of Article 273f).164 The article shows that forcing 
or inducing a person to have an abortion, in any case, can be regarded as serious bodily harm 

162 A situation in which an unconscious woman was tattooed was found to be serious physical injury by the 
Supreme Court (Cleiren & Nijboer, 2008, p. 1272, referring to Supreme Court, 22 May 1990, NJ 1991, 93).

in accordance with the judgments in the Sneep case. The list in this article is not, in fact, 
exhaustive, which means the courts also have the freedom to treat other instances as serious 
physical injury.165

11.6 Attempt and complicity

11.6.1 Attempt

Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code quickly leads to a completed offence. For example, for 
subsection (1) or subsection (4) it is not necessary for the victim to already have been work-
ing in prostitution.166 In fact, in practically167 all the cases in 2007 that were studied where 
attempt was declared proven, there was also a completed offence.
This applies to the indictments where the attempt was the principal168 charge as much as for 
the convictions on an alternative charge of attempted human trafficking with acquittal on the 
principal offence charged.
Attempted human trafficking was charged as a principal offence in six judgments. A princi-
pal or alternative charge of attempted human trafficking was ultimately declared proven in 
nine judgments.

District Court in Rotterdam169

The public prosecutor had brought principal charges under Article 273f (1) (5) and, alternatively, 
attempt thereto. At the hearing, the public prosecutor asked for acquittal on both the completed 
offence and the attempt because, according to the public prosecutor, there had been a voluntary 
withdrawal. The court rejected this and convicted for attempted human trafficking. The court’s 
further findings on the evidence show that the actual prostitution had not taken place but that 
the victim had made herself available for it. This could therefore imply a completed offence.

District Court in Groningen170

In this case, the public prosecutor brought charges under Article 273f (1) (4) and at the hearing 
amended them to the attempt variant. In this context, one of the actions (‘accommodation in 
his home’) was amended at the hearing to ‘offered (temporary) shelter’. Even ‘providing (tem-
porary) shelter’ would fall under the terms ‘accommodate or shelter’ in Article 273f (1) (1) and 
would therefore have constituted a completed offence.

aborting or destroying a foetus in utero. 2. The term ‘serious bodily harm’ also include a disorder of the intel-
lectual faculties lasting more than four weeks.’

167 In the judgments of the Amsterdam District Court (6 November 2007, unpublished) it is not clear what the 

actual events were. The suspect was proved to have made agreements to transfer the victim to an unknown 
man for €500, which was described as attempt to commit an offence under Article. 273f (1) (9).

168 For example, in Almelo District Court (2 March 2007, unpublished) where offences under subsections (1), 
(4) and (9) were charged in the attempt variant. The court convicted for attempt and found in the grounds for 
sentencing that the attempt had failed because the woman resisted. But even in this case, the conduct found 
proven indicates a full offence.

District Court in Utrecht171

The public prosecutor brought charges under Article 273f (1) (4) in conjunction with Article 45 
Dutch Criminal Code. Here too, the court found that it had been proved that the suspect had 
provided shelter to the victim and that the suspect had brought the victim to the Zandpad (the 
place of prostitution). As in the case in the District Court in Groningen (23 January 2007), the 
proven facts produced the completed offence under Article 273f (1) (1).

The District Court in The Hague172 found in this context that ‘although it can be declared 
proven that the suspect transported, moved and accommodated the complainant, these acts, 
given their external manifestation, should be regarded more as a start to the implementation 
of the suspect’s intention to recruit the complainant as a prostitute, and therefore as an at-
tempt, than as a completed offence’ (italics: BNRM). Given the text of the law, and in light of 
the international legislation, this finding is incorrect (see also §11.4.1). The question is, what 
should then be regarded as a punishable attempt? Sending SMS messages with a recruiting 
text? Driving along the Zandpad (in Utrecht) when a room has already been rented?
In the bill to implement the Council of Europe’s Convention on the protection of children 
against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (the Lanzarote Convention), grooming is made a 
specific offence (see Article 23 of the Convention).173 The loverboy method also has a so-called 
grooming period, during which seduction and separation are used to facilitate exploitation. 
Consequently, given other human trafficking/loverboy methods (see §9.4.3), rape and mak-
ing recordings of it and threatening to post them on the internet can constitute violence, 
threats and compulsion as a prelude to later exploitation.
The Court of Appeal in Arnhem174 found that seduction was not enough for a finding of 
criminal attempt. Advocate-General Machielse explained in his advisory opinion for the Su-
preme Court’s judgment of 2 October 2001175 how every offence has its own acts of commis-
sion and how, in that case, it was important whether deception had started. In that case, the 
Court of Appeal in Den Bosch had ruled that writing love letters, the suspect’s statement 
that he wanted a relationship with the victim and his telling the victims that he was very rich 
were sufficient to deceive those women. The court also found that with an offence like hu-
man trafficking, disguising one’s intentions was actually a characteristic of deception. The 
Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.
The District Court in Haarlem176 declared criminal attempt proven, which consisted of the 
suspect saying to a victim in a forceful way: “You will be my whore and you can earn €300 
to €500”.

A successful prosecution at an earlier stage could have a preventive effect and provide the 
basis for development of case law. Filing an appeal is also important in that regard.

11.6.2 Complicity

In 10 cases, complicity in human trafficking was the principal or alternative charge brought. 
In seven cases, the charges led to a full acquittal on the human trafficking offences charged. 
In two cases, the charges were declared proven and there was a conviction for this form of 
participation.

The acts of accommodating or sheltering, transporting and moving per se constitute the ele-
ments of the definition of the offence in Article 273f (1) (1). Contrast this with the situation 
of a driver in an armed robbery (Article 312 Dutch Criminal Code), for example, where the 
transport does not constitute an element of the offence. In assessing a charge based on Arti-
cle 273f (1) (1), the stated acts must be assigned their own significance. The definition of the 
offence is met with the act of transporting or accommodating itself (naturally in addition to 
the existence of the means of coercion and intention). The legislature explicitly made these 
acts separate offences as human trafficking.

The District Court in Middelburg177 acquitted on the charges of ‘human trafficking in concert’ and 
convicted on ‘complicity in human trafficking’. In this case, it found only the act of driving /
transporting was proven and described this as complicity. Without seeing the case file, it is 
impossible to say anything more about the actual events and therefore about the cooperation 
between this suspect and the principal suspect. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw some con-
clusions from the grounds for sentencing: ‘The suspect acted, for remuneration, as a chauffeur 
driving to and from Antwerp with his cousin’s girlfriend, who was working in prostitution. 
The suspect gradually realised from telephone calls that this girlfriend had not freely made up 
her mind to perform that work, but she was induced to do it by his cousin. The suspect should 
consequently have decided not to act as an accomplice for his cousin any longer. The court 
blames him for nevertheless continuing with the transport. This made him an accomplice to 
human trafficking.’ The court decided in its finding for acquittal that complicity in human traf-
ficking could not be declared proven simply because the suspect was entirely subordinate to his 
older cousin and ‘performed a non-essential role for the offence by acting as a driver and transport-
ing the victim to and from Antwerp at times determined by the cousin’ (italics: BNRM).
All in all, it is therefore still clear that in the court’s opinion this suspect, as an accomplice, 
transported a woman for six and a half months who, as the suspect in any case knew after some 
time, was forced into prostitution.

It was otherwise in a case in the District Court in Haarlem,178 where the actions of transport-
ing and accommodating per se were regarded as complicity.

One-fifth of the convicted offenders performed the role of ‘snorder’, the person who brings 
a victim to and from the workplace. Almost three-quarters of the convicted offenders per-
formed the role of pimp. Half were involved in recruiting victims and 35% transported vic-
tims to the Netherlands from abroad. Roughly a quarter had to guard the victims and 5% of 
those convicted were operators of a sex business.179

On the different roles of offenders, see also §9.3.3.

11.7 Problems with evidence

11.7.1 Types of judgments

Some of the 108 analysed judgments were abridged judgments, with or without findings on 
the grounds for conviction or acquittal, some were abridged judgements with detailed evi-
dence following the filing of an appeal, some were so-called Promis judgments (rendered as 
part of the Promis programme, which is designed to improve the explanation of grounds 
given by judges in criminal cases) and three judgments were rendered by a police court. The 
following tables gives an overview.

Abridged judgments with detailed explanation of evidence180 14 13%

Promis judgments 18 17%

Police court judgments 3 3%

Total 108 100%

Of the 29 judgments that contained no further findings on the grounds for conviction or ac-
quittal or details of the evidence, there were 19 convictions (66%) and 10 acquittals (34%).
Caution is required here in view of the fact that in the analysed judgments from 2007 the 
evidence was only fleshed out in 30% of the cases (abridged judgments with detailed evi-
dence and Promis judgments).181 Where the court’s finding did devoete specific attention to 
problems with the evidence (79 judgments, or 70%), that information has been used. These 
79 judgments led to 55 convictions for human trafficking (70% of the 79 judgments).

179 The various roles are mutually exclusive. It is a regular occurrence that an offender performs different roles 
in human trafficking.

180 Two of these judgments included an additional finding setting out the evidence.

11.7.2 Reports of crime and statements by witnesses/victims

Victims of human trafficking can report this offence to the police and can make incriminating 
statements against defendants to the police and the examining magistrate. These reports and 
incriminating statements play an important role as evidence in human trafficking cases. How-
ever, in contrast to victims of other types of offence, victims of human trafficking are often still 
in one way or another under the influence of the alleged offenders during the investigation. 
Feelings of love or even anger often continue to linger for a long time, which creates problems 
for gathering evidence. There are victims who, for various reasons, will not report the crime 
or make an incriminating statement. Others will, but they often later retract them. These are 
common problems that judges in human trafficking cases have to deal with in practice.

District Court in Utrecht182

The court found that although there was legal evidence of forced prostitution, the court was 
not convinced. The decisive factor was that the victim had not reported the crime and had 
retracted earlier incriminating statements before the examining magistrate and at the hearing. 
The court devoted a general finding to this point:
“If the person who actually performed the work firmly insists that it was not involuntary and 
that it also did not occur under circumstances of which it could be said that the work was there-
fore performed under forced conditions, then, in the court’s opinion, it is not a situation in 
which criminal law can provide protection.”

Without going into the specific facts of this case, this finding is remarkable. Such a general 
finding (and obiter dictum) fails to recognise the problem surrounding reporting offences in 
human trafficking cases. The consent of a victim is not relevant when means of coercion are 
used. Even the victim who consents must receive protection under criminal law.

This was true in 64% of all judgments as well as 74% of all convictions. The opposite would 
then apply for exonerating statements (17% and 9%, respectively) or conflicting statements 
(15% and 9%, respectively).
It is evident in 69 (64%) of the 108 analysed judgments that a (presumed) victim reported the 
offence against the suspect and/or an incriminating statement about the suspect to the police 
and/or the examining magistrate.183 Convictions were handed down in 55 (80%) of these 69 
judgements. In 52 of the 69 judgments there was at least one or more reports of the offence 
by (presumed) victims, in 39 of which (75%) there was a conviction for human trafficking.
Statements made by victims to the police or the examining magistrate exonerating suspects 
were mentioned in at least 18 judgments. Fewer than half of these involved convictions.184

In at least 16 judgments, there were both incriminating and exonerating statements by vic-
tims. These could have been from the same victims – who retracted an earlier report of the 
offence or an earlier incriminating statement – but it also occurs that different witnesses 
contradict each other in the same case. Fewer than half of these judgments resulted in con-
victions for human trafficking.185

The following section discusses the possible consequences of the court’s decision on the reli-
ability of the incriminating and exonerating statements made by witnesses or victims.

It sometimes appears that statements by witnesses/victims have been influenced by sus-
pects.

District Court in Amsterdam186

‘Whereas the suspect would have us believe that the victims entered prostitution voluntarily, 
the court points out that these were young, vulnerable women who through his actions were 
in a position of dependency on him and that there is then no longer any question of ‘voluntari-
ness’. One thing and another even led one of the victims to be willing to make false statements 
under oath in order to exonerate the suspect.’

District Court in Utrecht187

‘The suspect’s lawyer has, in an attachment to a letter of 7 December 2006, sent the court a 
letter from the complainant to her father. At the hearing, the complainant stated that she had 
indeed written the letter. The letter says that she was not forced to work in prostitution. The 
complainant has stated that the suspect forced her to write the letter. Partly in view of every-
thing stated above, the court finds this explanation by the complainant to be credible.’188

In this judgment, the court also stressed the victim’s fear. The court described the impression 
that the victim had made: ‘During the hearing the complainant also made a reliable and credible 
impression. The impression to emerge from the case file is of a victim, complainant, who was to-

tally in thrall to the suspect and for whom the mere thought of the defendant was enough to cause 
great panic and total dismay. For example, various police officers who interviewed her stated that 
the complainant literally shook with fear during an interview as she described what had hap-
pened to her. The testimony of the complainant during the hearing confirmed this impression. 
The complainant was also very emotional and her body was shaking during the hearing.’

Four judgments also showed that witnesses/victims are threatened.

There was evidence of threats to witnesses/victims in the Sneep case. In the grounds for the 
sentencing of one of the suspects, the court found that the suspects wer not averse to mak-
ing threats, as clearly shown by threats to blow up the home of the family of the complain-
ant (victim) with explosives or even to murder the complainant if she did not withdraw her 
report of the crime.189

On occasion, the public prosecution service says that there are more victims than those who 
reported a crime or otherwise made a statement at the time of the summons. Evidence is 
sometimes collected via wire taps or observation,190 in which case the identity of some per-
sons remains unknown. These persons are therefore not identified by name as victims in the 
indictment, which is sometimes inevitable in human trafficking cases. In a number of cases 
in 2007, however, the courts decided that the description of ‘these persons’, or ‘one or more 
(other) women’ in the indictment was not clear enough and those parts of the indictments 
were declared null and void.191

A problem of an entirely different order occurred in a case before the police court in Mid-
delburg. Occasionally a person is summoned for making a false report of human trafficking. 
The police court in Middelburg acquitted a suspect of this in 2007.

District Court in Middelburg192

A woman was suspected of making two false reports. The public prosecutor regarded the first 
report of the offence as false because the suspect had failed to disclose the fact that she had been 
in Belgium for some time in the period from July to December 2005, and in any case on 11 Sep-
tember 2005 and for some time afterwards. The public prosecutor considered the second report 
to be false because the suspect stated that during the entire period from July 2005 to March 
2007 she had been in the power of the man who abused her, although she could demonstrably 
have made a complaint and had been in an institution receiving help in December 2005.
In the view of the police court, the official record of the first report of the offence contained so 
many formal defects that it could not serve as evidence of the accuracy of any statement made 
by the suspect. There had been no professional interpreter, the complainant had not signed 
it, no reasons were given for the change in the subject matter of the report of the crime (as a 
result of which change the guidelines in the Instruction on investigation of and prosecuting 
of sexual abuse should have been followed and had not been), there was no second interview-

ing officer present, the questions asked were not recorded, the place of the offence was given 
as the police station, etc. Furthermore, the court described the content of the official report 
as so incomplete and inadequate as to have no significance as a truth-finding document. The 
suspect’s statement that she had the feeling that she was not being taken seriously in making 
the complaint seemed to the police court to be an understatement. The suspect made a second 
report of the offence to another police force 18 months later. The public prosecution service 
felt it was plausible that this was also a false report, particularly because during the intake in-
terview preceding the complaint, the suspect had not said that she had already reported the 
crime in Amsterdam in December 2005 and because the story about Belgium did not appear 
in the Amsterdam complaint. The public prosecutor accepted this conclusion and decided that 
the suspect should be arrested for making a false report.
The police magistrate found that this conclusion was premature, to say the least. There was 
no question of essential contradictions between the two complaints. The main points of the 
suspect’s story matched in the two different reports (the man [name and alias], his external 
features, including a noticeable tattoo in the shape of a heart, the departure from Middelburg 
and stay in a house in or near The Hague, the rapes, the departure to Belgium and the stay in 
a brothel there, the return to the Netherlands and the stay in a house in Amsterdam). It is not 
unusual for gaps to appear in the recording of such interviews, as the expert witness explained 
at the hearing. These can be explained by the many fears, taboos and uncertainties, as well as 
the erratic sense of time, that victims of human trafficking usually suffer from.
In this case, the police court felt it was not incomprehensible that the suspect had not told the 
story about Belgium when making the complaint in Amsterdam, simply because so much em-
phasis was placed on the rapes (the official report starts with the phrase: ‘I have just told you 
how I came to the Netherlands and now I want to tell you about the rape’).
In the police court’s opinion, the failure to refer to the earlier Amsterdam report in the first 
part of the second complaint was explained by the fact that the interview stopped with the stay 
in Belgium. The fact that the complaint was not raised during the intake interview had no deci-
sive significance, according to the police court, because an intake interview cannot be equated 
with reporting a crime; furthermore, the intake interview only took two pages to describe a 
period of more than 18 months, during which the suspect had been in many different places, 
all of them strange to her. It is very possible that the suspect simply forgot to explain certain 
events or skipped them because she felt they were less important.
The police court therefore also found that it had not be legally or convincingly proven that 
the suspect intended to mislead the police when making the second report of the crime, and 
acquitted her.

11.7.3 Reliability of witness statements of (presumed) victims

A victim of human trafficking often experiences various psychological and physical prob-
lems as a result of the crime she has suffered. Psychological problems, in particular, including 
post-traumatic stress syndrome, can lead to a loss of recall about events. This has an influence 
on the witness statements made by presumed victims of human trafficking. In addition, for 
various reasons (such as shame, fear of reprisals and feelings of love for the human trafficker) 
victims are not always willing to make a statement.193 The Instruction on human trafficking 

193 Shreki (2009). For an extensive (quantitative) study see C. Zimmerman et al.: Stolen Smiles: a summary re-
port on the physical and psychological health consequences of women and adolescents trafficked in Europe, find-
ings from a European study, The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine 2006.

includes guidelines on how the police and public prosecutors should treat presumed victims 
of human trafficking during interviews.194 In this part of the case-law study, we investigated 
which factors played a role in the court’s assessment of witness statements by victims. In 42 
(39%) of the 108 judgments, the court commented favourably or negatively on the reliability 
of the witness statements that were used as evidence in the trial in its findings.

Professor R. Bullens (professor of forensic psychology and diagnostics) appeared as an expert 
witness in the Sneep mega case, in which role he assessed the reliability of the statements made 
by victims. He stated that in assessing the reliability of statements, he mainly considered the 
following:

 – the victim’s personality (in which possible personality disorders can play a role);
 – the internal consistency of the statements made by a victim (where the degree of consistency 

within a single statement and between the different statements made by the same victim play 
a role); and

 – the interview techniques employed (where the environment in which the statements are tak-
en must be professional – the environment and the atmosphere during the interview and the 
attitude of the interviewers must be neutral – and the degree to which further questions are 
asked, particularly about inconsistencies, play a role).195

The first two factors that, according to Bullens, influence the reliability of victims’ statements 
can also be found in the judgments in 2007 that were analysed by BNRM, but the approriate 
interviewing techniques were not.

Different factors in assessing the reliability of a witness statement
The analysis of the 42 findings of guilt or innocence show that the courts took into account 
five different factors in assessing whether witness statements were reliable or not. The 
distribution of these five factors is shown in Table 11.12. The different factors are then de-
scribed.

447

1. The presence/absence of supporting evidence
In 32 judgments, the findings of the court included a mention of whether the statements by 
a victim were or were not supported by other evidence. In half of these judgments, the court 
specifically stated that the supporting evidence took the form of statements by other wit-
nesses; in the other half, other supporting evidence sufficed. The presence of supporting evi-
dence probably has a positive effect on the court’s perception of the reliability of the state-
ments, and the absence of supporting evidence and/or the presence of conflicting evidence 
probably has a negative effect on the court’s perception of their reliability. In 21 judgments, 
the court stressed the existence of other evidence to support the witness statements.

2. The statements: degree of consistency
In 24 judgements, the court referred to the internal consistency196 of the statements. For ex-
ample, a court occasionally specifically mentioned the consistency or inconsistency of dif-
ferent statements by a victim. This probably has an impact on the judge’s perception of the 
reliability of the statements.
In four cases, the court found that different statements made by the same victim were con-
sistent as regards content.
In 13 judgments, the court in fact stressed that the statements made by the victim differed 
from each other, as in the following finding: ‘Complainant B made an incriminating state-
ment to the police, but watered down that statement on essential points, and partly retracted 
it, before the examining magistrate.’197 In seven judgments, the court acknowledged that 
there were internal inconsistencies between the different statements of a presumed victim 
but found these inconsistencies to be explicable because, in these cases, the victims were 
under the influence of the suspects at the time they made the inconsistent, exculpatory state-
ment. Several explanations given by the courts for inconsistent statements are ‘fear of (re-
prisals by) the suspect’, ‘love/sympathy for the defendant’ and ‘a situation of dependency in 
which the victim finds herself’, as found, for example, by the District Court in Arnhem.198 It 
is noteworthy that the courts have sometimes sought their own explanation for the incon-
sistencies in statements, which suggests that in these cases, the court took into account the 
specific problems surrounding victim statements in human trafficking cases.

District Court in Utrecht199

‘In the court’s opinion, there are no inconsistencies that affect the reliability and prevent the 
use of the statements by the witness (name of witness) as evidence in court. Rather, in the later 
statements of (name of witness) there is only a seemingly forced denial of the earlier detailed 
report of the crime in 2005, in which the witness is unable to convincingly explain the rea-
son for the later retraction and which persons other than the suspect were responsible for the 

196 By internal consistency is meant that the statements by the same victim are in agreement. By external con-
sistency is meant that the statements of different victims are in agreement.

events described by her in 2005. It was also noteworthy in this context that the later statements 
made by (name of witness) contained no new information.’
‘(…) the court feels that there is sufficient evidence that the witness was still in a similar posi-
tion at the hearing’.
A striking aspect in this case is that in an official report of findings drawn up by the public pros-
ecutor, she (the public prosecutor) stated that the witness must make a truthful statement at 
the hearing but that she would not arrest the suspect on a charge of perjury if she did not. The 
court found that this was undesirable since it ‘[is] essential for the criminal process, in which 
the finding of truth is central, that a witness testifying under oath must tell the truth and not 
be granted a certain degree of immunity in advance by the public prosecutor’. Nevertheless, 
the court understood that the public prosecutor wanted to ensure that this particular witness 
would appear at the hearing.
This was in fact the first case in which a so-called ‘scope official report’ was inserted in the case 
file, including a detailed description by Professor R. Bullens of the position in which victims 
of loverboys find themselves, a situation in which loverboys do not shun threats of violence, 
intense psychological pressure and playing on the feelings of guilt of usually vulnerable young 
women. The court therefore did not bring charges of perjury.200

3. The statements: level of detail
In 11 judgements, the court assigned value to the detailed nature of the statements made by 
the presumed victims. A statement can contain many details or only a few; which probably 
has an effect on the judge’s perception of the reliability of the statement. This factor was 
cited in a positive sense in 10 cases. In one case, it had a negative effect, precisely because 
there were no details.

4. The likelihood that a statement is true or false
In nine judgments, the courts found that it was not plausible that a witness statement made 
by a victim was false and regarded the statement as reliable. This assumption was based ei-
ther on the lack of a motive to make a false statement, the fact that the statement was par-
tially exculpatory or because it was not shown that the statement was made in exchange for 
a residence permit.

District Court in Groningen201

‘It appeared to the court that there was no motive to make a false statement, since the women 
were very fearful of make incriminating statements about the suspects and also seemed to have 
no further interest in disclosing all the information.’

200 This seems to be an application of the non-punishment principle (see Chapter 6).

Case law on exploitation in the sex industry

449

In five judgments in 2007, information emerged about the residence status of 19 victims.202 
In one of the few cases in which a court made a finding on the residence status of a victim, it 
did so in relation to the aspect of vulnerability:

District Court in The Hague203

‘Although this is not explicitly shown by the case file, the court takes as its point of departure 
in assessing the status of the victims in this case that they were all living illegally in the Nether-
lands. The court reaches this conclusion on the basis partly of the repatriation of these victims 
to Bulgaria and partly the reference to the so-called B9 status. Their illegal status in the Neth-
erlands greatly increased the vulnerability of victims’ position.’

In two judgments204 in 2007, the court rejected the argument by the defence that the victims 
had only reported the crime against the defendant to secure B9 status. In both cases, the 
court found that this argument was not supported by the facts and circumstances. From the 
defence’s point of view, in particular, acquiring B9 status could be put forward as a motive 
for making a false statement with respect to the suspect. It is therefore interesting that only 
two judgments expressly commented on such a motive. This does not mean that the issue of 
the victim securing B9 status after reporting a crime of trafficking was not raised in a crimi-
nal case, but apparently it is not often used by the defence as an explicit ground for challeng-
ing the reliability of the statement. In none of the judgments did the court mention acquiring 
B9 status as an indication that a false statement had been made or as otherwise undermining 
the reliability of the statement made by the presumed victim. It is, in fact, seldom possible to 
conclude from the judgments whether a presumed victim secured B9 status or not.205

5. The personality of the witness
In four judgements, the courts specifically addressed the impression that the witness had 
made. This impression can be overwhelmingly positive or negative, which would probably 
have a positive or negative impact on the judge’s perception of the reliability of that person’s 
statements. In the four cases in which the factor was mentioned, the finding was positive.

The reliability of a witness statement
Together,206 the five factors described above provide a benchmark for the reliability the 
courts have attached to witness statements in their judgments. This section looks for a pos-
sible correlation between findings about the general reliability of witness statements and the 
resulting convictions or acquittals.

Average score on reliability207** -1.18208 1.45209

N=42
**p<0.01

Table 11.13 shows that the average score for reliability in the judgments210 leading to a convic-
tion for human trafficking was significantly higher than the score for reliability in the judg-
ments that led to a full acquittal on charges for human trafficking offences. This means that 
the more reliable a judge feels witness statements are, the greater the chance is of a convic-
tion for one or more human trafficking offences.

Strikingly, of the 33 acquittals (in 25 of which findings on the evidence were included), only 
four explicitly mentioned that a statement by a witness should be dismissed as unreliable. 
In the other acquittals, part of the reason for acquittal was to be found in the victims’ state-
ments (such as the fact that the victim withdrew the report of the crime or denied being 
exploited, or the statement was not supported by other evidence).211 Part of the explanation 
for the acquittals lay in the interpretation of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code.

206 A factor that is expected to have had a positive influence on the perception of reliability is coded +1; a fac-
tor that is expected to have had a negative influence on this perception is coded -1; and a factor that is not 
mentioned in a judgment is coded 0. The factors are added together and form a scale variable that shows the 
court’s perception of the reliability. Cronbach’s alpha: 0.51. A score of +5 means that the court felt the wit-
ness statements were very reliable and a score of -5 means the court regarded the witness statements as very 
unreliable. The average reliability score for the 42 judgments is 0.76 (SD: 1.68) with a minimum of -2 and a 
maximum of 4.

The 108 judgments in 2007 that were studied involved a total of 257 (presumed) victims.212 
Because it is possible that the same person appears as a victim in different charges against 
different suspects, the victims are not, by definition, 257 different persons. The total number 
of victims that are ultimately mentioned in the convictions is 174. This means that in 83 cases 
(32%), a victim was identified as such by the public prosecution service but there was no 
conviction on the human trafficking offence with respect to that person. This figure corre-
sponds almost precisely with the percentage of acquittals for human trafficking (31%). These 
figures also do not necessarily involve 174 or 83 different persons.

On average, there were 2.4 victims in each case that was brought and 2.4 victims in each con-

there was a minimum of one victim and a maximum of 14.

Table 11.16 shows that the vast majority of all presumed and recognised victims were woman. 
The gender of five of the presumed and two of the recognised victims was unknown. At least 
34 victims were underage (younger than 18) and at least 12 were under the age of 16. However, 
the date of birth is only included for 91 of the presumed and 68 of the recognised victims in 
the judgments. It is suspected that this was done mainly if a victim was underage or had just

The case relating to the 11-year-old victim is atypical.217 The suspect in this case was a pae-
dophile with a personality disorder who was accused both of indecency with a number of 
young boys and the exploitation of two boys aged 11 and 14 respectively. The suspect was sen-
tenced to two years in prison with a hospital order for compulsory psychiatric treatment.

11.8.2 Specific characteristics of the offence

Place of forced work
Most cases in 2007, according to the 74 judgments in which suspects were convicted of 
human trafficking, involved forced employment in the sex industry in the Netherlands. In 
at least five cases, a victim was also forced to perform work abroad. Three cases involved 
forced prostitution in the Netherlands and abroad. In two cases, victims were recruited in 
the Netherlands and put to work in Antwerp in Belgium.

District Court in Den Bosch220

The District Court in Den Bosch ruled in a case where the suspect was accused of exploiting 
a woman in prostitution from 1 January 1995 to 22 November 2006, almost 12 years. The court 
found that the victim worked voluntarily in prostitution in the period from 1 January 1995 to 1 
January 1998 and acquitted on the charge of exploitation in that period. The court also found 
that although the victim was in love with the suspect, was significantly younger and had little 
experience of life, there was insufficient evidence that she was under the influence of the sus-
pect to such an extent that she had no free choice in working in prostitution, partly because the 
victim also declared that although it was at the suspect’s request, she had chosen voluntarily for 
prostitution.221 She was in love and wanted to earn money to enable the suspect to pay off his 
debts, said the court. But after 1 January 1998, according to the court, there was coercion and 
the period for which the suspect was convicted was slightly less than nine years, during which 
the suspect had violently exploited the victim. The prosecution had demanded five years’ im-
prisonment. The court found a shorter (but still extremely long) period of exploitation to have 
been proved and imposed a 36-month prison sentence, with six months conditional.222

11.8.3 Non-punishment principle and repeated victim status

Non-punishment principle
Two judgments found that a victim personally committed criminal offences under the influ-
ence or coercion of the suspect. These offences involved being an accessory to human traf-
ficking and an accessory to rape.

Repeated victim status
There was at least one case in 2007 in which a person had repeatedly been a victim. The 
judgment of the District Court in Utrecht223 shows that in the period from 1 May 2003 to 31 
October 2003, the victim was forced to prostitute herself, then fled and stayed in a shelter 
for battered women, whereupon she again fell into the hands of the same suspect and again 
allowed herself to be prostituted from 1 January 2005 to 13 September 2006. Only then did

11.9 Sentences and grounds for sentencing

11.9.1 Nature of the sentences demanded and imposed

The sentences demanded
Table 11.18 shows that prison sentences were demanded in 96 (89%) of the 108 judgments 
analysed; in 94 of the cases, a wholly or partially suspendend sentence was demanded. The 
prison sentences were demanded in combination with community service four times, in 
combination with a supplementary sentence (a confiscation order) seven times, and in com-
bination with a non-punitive order 10 times (the confiscation of seized goods seven times 
and hospital orders three times). As far as is known, in no case was a community service 
order or a fine the heaviest punishment demanded by the public prosecution service.224 On 
one occasion, the public prosecution service did demand full acquittal225 on all charges; the 
defendant was acquitted in that case.

The sentences imposed
Table 11.19 shows that prison sentences were imposed in 72 (97%) of the 74 convictions, 70 of 
which were wholly or partially unsuspended. The prison sentences were imposed in combi-
nation with community service eight times, in combination with a supplementary sentence 
(a confiscation order) twice and in combination with a non-punitive order five times (con-
fiscation of seized goods four times and a hospital order once). The heaviest sentence in one 
case was community service and in one case a fine. As regards the 35 sentences in which a 
(partially) suspended prison sentence was imposed, both general and special conditions were 
imposed during the probation period on nine occasions. The special conditions related to 
following the instructions and directions of the Probation Service in three cases and a ban 
on establishing contact with the victim in three cases.

229 The figures in this table differ to a limited extent from Table 10.10, which come from the public prosecution 
service’s data. For example, one judgment is not included in the public prosecution service’s data, so the 
total number of convictions for human trafficking is 73 rather than 74 (this was the judgment rendered by 
the Groningen District Court on 3 April 2007 – unpublished). This also explains the difference between 
the figures of 69 (public prosecution service’s data) and 70 (BNRM study) for the (partially) unconditional 
prison sentences impsesd. In addition, there is a discrepancy as regards the community service sentences 
(public prosecution service data=2, BNRM study=1) and fines (public prosecution service data=1, BNRM 
study=1). In the case of Haarlem District Court (7 December 2007, unpublished), only a fine was imposed 
for the offence of human trafficking and not a community service sentence. This is a judgment by the police 
court, which does not show whether the case involved unqualified or aggravated human trafficking, so that 
this inaccuracy in Table 10.10 could not be corrected.

230 This is not equal to the sum of the individual percentages in this column because the individual percentages 
have been rounded off.

11.9.2 Differences between the sentences demanded and imposed

In the 74 convictions in 2007, the court usually imposed a lighter sentence than was demand-
ed. This was probably due largely to the fact that the charges on which the public prosecution 
service’s demand was based were not all declared proven. In five judgments, the court im-
posed a heavier sentence than the public prosecution service had demanded, and in 14 judge-
ments the court imposed the sentence demanded. The most striking judgment (in which the 
court imposed a higher sentence than the public prosecution service had demanded) was the 
judgment of the District Court in Haarlem,231 in which 12 months’ imprisonment (with four 
months suspended) was demanded and the court imposed a sentence of 36 months, with 12 
months suspended. The court found that the punishment demanded by the public prosecu-
tion service totally failed to reflect the seriousness of the offences. This case involved two 
young victims aged 17 and younger than 16, whom the suspect had brought from Germany 
and then forced to work in prostitution and exploited for three months in the Netherlands. 
Although the public prosecutor did not explicitly bring charges under Article 273f (3) (2) 
Dutch Criminal Code,232 that is how they were treated by the court.

In the 70 cases that led to a conviction for human trafficking, in which a (partially) unsus-
pended prison sentence was demanded, the average unconditional prison sentence demand-
ed was 30.2 months, ranging from 0.25 to a maximum of 144 months.
In 2007, if a (partially) unsuspended prison sentence was imposed in first instance, the aver-
age unconditional prison sentence was 20.6 months, ranging from 0.10 to a maximum of 144 
months.

The district court in Utrecht236 imposed the highest prison sentence of 12 years.237 In that 
case, the violence and exploitation had lasted around four and a half years in relation to 
one victim (victim A). There were two other victims. The judgment corresponded with the 
demand, although the court found that one offence had not been proven and the sentence 
therefore in fact exceeded the demand. In the grounds for the sentencing, the court referred 
to a humiliating situation of exploitation and excessive violence. Another point of attention 
was that the suspect did not appear at the hearing (suspect had been released). The evidence 
also showed that the first victim was forced to have an abortion when she was five months 
pregnant. This was not taken into account as an aggravating circumstance. The suspect ap-
pealed and the court of appeal238 acquitted him on a number of elements. The court of appeal 
broke down the sentence by victim and found five years to be appropriate for the exploitation 
and serious violence against victim A. Consequently, the full sentence came to six years and 
11 months.
Both the court of appeal and the district court mentioned the manipulative, deceptive lover-
boy technique, the dependency, the excessive violence and the lack of respect, as well as the 
serious consequences for the victim. The court of appeal also mentioned another fact that 
was taken into account in the suspect’s favour, which was that the proven attempted man-
slaughter was a light variant that caused no lasting physical injury.239

The district court in Middelburg240 imposed the lightest sentence in 2007. For complicity 
(see also §11.6.2) over a period of six and a half months with respect to one victim, the district 
court sentenced a 23-year-old suspect to 90 days in prison (of which 83 were suspended) and 
60 hours of community service. In addition to the partially suspended prison sentence, the 
public prosecution service had demanded 240 hours of community service. The suspect in 
this case was also not in preventive custody at the time of the trial.

234 SD=25.5; N=70 (in three cases the sentence demanded is not known (police court judgments), and in one 
case only a suspended prison sentence was demanded).

tence at all was imposed (community service and fine)).

11.9.3 Sentences

Given the small number of cases in which a form of punishment other than an unconditional 
prison sentence was demanded or imposed and given the small number of cases in which 
only a suspended prison sentence was demanded or imposed, this section only reviews the 
relationships between the relevant variables and the unconditional prison sentences that were 
demanded and imposed in the judgments that included a conviction for human trafficking. 
This section first describes a number of factors that are expected to influence the sentence 
imposed and then explores possible connections.

Factors influencing sentences
Sexual violence: this covers all situations in which the suspect has used sexual violence. This 
involves rape and/or other sexual violence, as separately proven offences or as an element 
(means of coercion) of human trafficking. Examples of ‘other sexual violence’ would include 
sexual abuse of a minor, sexual relations with a person under the age of 16 and indecent as-
sault. The sexual violence can also be aimed at a person other than the victim of the offence 
of human trafficking.
(Brute) force: this covers all cases in which the suspect used physical non-sexual violence. 
Physical non-sexual violence against the victim and/or third parties both as separate offences 
or as an element (means of coercion) of human trafficking fall under this factor. Examples of 
physical violence include gross maltreatment and simple assault.241

Deception (‘loverboys’ method): This covers all cases in which the suspect deceived the victim 
in connection with a relationship or a future together.242

Age of victim: in this context, we studied the age of the youngest victim in each judgment 
and made a distinction between victims younger than 16, victims between the ages of 16 
and 18, victims between the ages of 18 and 21 (barely adults) and victims aged 21 and older 
(adults).243

Number of victims: the number of victims of human trafficking in each judgment.244

Duration of the offence: this is the number of days of the longest human trafficking offence 
declared proven in each judgment.
Recidivism: was there any form of recidivism.245

241 (Brute) force also has to be seen in relation to the human trafficking offence, which means it is less important 
whether this violence was also used against the victim of human trafficking.

242 This category can also cover foreign victims who are not deceived by a human trafficker about a relationship 
or a future together (‘loverboy’) but by an appealing story about a bright future in the Netherlands.

243 These are the youngest victims in the 74 judgments involving convictions for human trafficking. It is possible 
that the status as victim was not established for all these victims. That would be the case if the human traf-
ficking offences that were charged were not all declared proven and the youngest victim was related to one of 
the human trafficking offences on which the court acquitted.

244 In other words, victims of other offences declared proven are not counted here.
245 This could be previous human trafficking offences (four times), violent offences (ten times), offences against 

public decency (twice), offences against property (four times), drugs offences (once) and other offences

The average unconditional prison sentence imposed was 19.50 months,246 with the shortest 
sentence being less than one month and the longest sentence 144 months.247

Table 11.22 shows the distribution of the unconditional part of the prison sentences im-
posed.

0 to 12 months 27 37%

13 to 24 months 31 42%

More than 2 years 16 22%

Total 74 100%

In only three of the 16 judgments in which an unconditional prison sentence of more than 
two years was imposed were there sentences of longer than four years. Tables 11.23 to 11.25 
show the correlations between the seven factors described above and the unconditional 
prison sentences imposed. As Table 11.23 shows, there is a significant correlation between 
a conviction for sexual violence and the sentence imposed. It can be stated that if a form of 
sexual violence is found to have been proven, the unconditional prison sentence imposed 
is higher. This positive correlation with the sentence also seems to exist where there was 
physical non-sexual violence, and is, in fact, very significant. The finding that the loverboy 
method (deception in connection with a relationship/a future together) was used shows no 
significant relationship with the sentence imposed,248 nor does the presence of any form of 
recidivism. The latter is particularly noteworthy, since the presence or absence of any form 
of recidivism is almost always mentioned by the court in the grounds for sentencing as an 
aggravating or mitigating circumstance.

(twelve times). In all, 25 (34%) of the 74 (100%) convicted human traffickers were repeat offenders in one 
way or another.

246 SD and N are 19.10 and 74 respectively – NB: This average differs slightly from the average mentioned ear-
lier – see Table 11.21. The explanation for this is that the four judgments in which no unconditional prison 
sentence was imposed are also included here (in two cases the prison sentences were entirely suspended and 
in two cases there was no prison sentence). However, these four cases of 0 months do say something about 
the sentences and so they are included here.

247 The 74 convictions for human trafficking include 31 cases where a suspect was simultaneously convicted of 
another offence. Obviously, these other offences have an impact on the sentence.

248 This form of deception is apparently only regarded as a method that is used.

Table 11.24 shows that 18 of the 74 convictions involved at least one underage victim. There 
seems to be no significant correlation between the ages of the victims and the sentence im-
posed. This is noteworthy, especially since a conviction for an offence involving a victim 
younger than 16 is an aggravating circumstance.256 However, the table does give the impres-
sion that sentences in the highest category of ‘more than two years’ are imposed relatively

254 This is not the same as sum of of the individual percentages in this row because the individual percentages

255 As already mentioned in §11.8.1, it is assumed that if a victim is underage or just over the age of maturity 

(between the ages of 18 and 21) this is specifically stated in the judgment, and if a victim is aged 21 or older it 
is not relevant to mention it. Consequently, this category also includes all unknown data.

256 As is discussed in §11.5.2, this aggravating circumstance is often not charged or declared proven.

result is not significant.257

Table 11.25 shows that a larger number of victims declared proven in a judgement coincides 
with a significantly higher unconditional prison sentence. There is a very significant correla-
tion between the proven duration of the human trafficking offence and the sentence. In other 
words, the longer the offence continued, the higher the unconditional prison sentence that 
was imposed.

Conclusion
The factors that have a signficant positive correlation with the unconditional prison sen-
tences imposed are, as expected, the use of sexual violence, the use of (brute) force, a larger 
number of victims and longer duration of the human trafficking offence. Contrary to what 
one would expect, there is no significant correlation between the sentence imposed and the 
presence of any form of recidivism or the younger age of the victims.

11.9.4 Orientation points

To achieve the greatest possible consistency in sentencing, orientation points (or sentenc-
ing guidelines) have been drawn up for various offences. Providing guidance for the courts, 
national orientation points are adopted at the meetings of the presidents of the criminal law 
divisions of the district courts and appeal courts (LOVS), after extensive consultation within 

257 As mentioned earlier, some of these victims may not be recognised by the court as victims. In addition to the 
unequal distribution among the various age categories, this may partially explain why there is no correlation 
between the ages of victims and the sentences imposed.

the courts. There are no orientation points for human trafficking at the moment, but it is 
clear from the following grounds for sentencing that these would fulfil a need.268

District Court in Almelo (Sneep)269

‘The court has looked at convictions by other courts in the country in an attempt to find simi-
larities with the facts and circumstances as they occurred in this case. Taking all this into ac-
count, the court in this case has taken as it its point of departure an unconditional prison sen-
tence of eight to ten months per victim, which minimum sentence is increased by the court if 
there was serious violence used against this victim. In addition, the court considered the length 
of the period in which the offences occurred as an aggravating or mitigating circumstance. The 
court has also taken into account whether there was rape, forced breast enlargement, or abor-
tion as a statutory ground for increasing the sentence, the role that the suspect played in the 
events and possible recidivism. The courts has also adopted as the point of departure for par-
ticipation in the criminal organisation a prison sentence of 12 months, and a prison sentence of 
24 months for the suspects that played a leading role in it.’270

In these cases,271 for example, the court imposed a prison sentence of eight months for being 
an accessory to human trafficking – Article 273f (1) (1), (3), (4), (6) and (9) Dutch Criminal 
Code. The court found that only one woman was involved, for a ‘relatively short’ period, with 
no use of serious violence. The duration of the exploitation was found to be nine months. 
Whether this is a relatively short period naturally depends on what it is compared with. It is 
not likely that the victim found this period – 270 days, six days a week – as relatively short.
The District Court in Utrecht272 also stated that in sentencing it referred to the sentences for 
similar offences and imposed a 15-month prison sentence for a period of five days of forced 
prostitution of one victim.
The District Court in Amsterdam273 also looked for orientation points in the sentencing and 
referred in that context to an earlier judgment of its own,274 and then explained why it was 
also departing from it slightly.
The maximum sentence for rape is 12 years’ imprisonment and the orientation point is 24 
months. The potential sentence for rape is higher than for unqualified human trafficking, 
for which the maximum sentence is eight years since 1 July 2009. Rape is regularly used as a 
means of coercion in human trafficking.

463

In this context, the District Court in Almelo275 found that offenders usually first have sexual 
contact with the woman, but this contact seems to be mainly intended to decide whether the 
victim is suitable for prostitution and also to break down her resistance to that work and to 
reduce any feelings of self-worth she might still have, whereupon she can then be brought 
into prostitution.
In four of the analysed judgements from 2007, rape was found to have been used as a means 
of coercion for human trafficking; in one judgement, rape was not only declared proven as a 
means of coercion but also as a separate offence276 and in three cases there was only a convic-
tion for rape as a separate offence. In one of these three cases, there was an acquittal on the 
charge of human trafficking. Table 11.26 provides some insight into the sentencing in these 
judgments.

In this case, there were convictions for human trafficking, human trafficking with respect to 
a victim who has not yet reached the age of 18 and one count of rape of the first victim. There 
was no violence, but there was coercion arising from the actual state of affairs, and the of-
fences took place over a period of a week. The demand was four years in prison. The court 
mitigated the sentence because of the suspect’s subordinate role and his openness towards 
the police, and imposed a prison sentence of 672 days, 180 days of which were suspended. 
The case in the District Court in Leeuwarden involved a former Chinese unaccompanied 
underage asylum seeker who had exhausted his asylum procedure. The suspect was accused 
of repeatedly raping the victim and inducing him to make himself available for prostitution, 
in concert, during a period of four and a half months. The public prosecutor demanded a 
prison sentence of eight years. The court acquitted the suspect of the human trafficking, but 
convicted him for the rape. Some violence was used and there was specific recidivism. The 
sentence was five years.
Some additional examples of sentencing are given below.

District Court in The Hague285

There was one victim, the exploitation lasted nine years and there was bizarre and excessive 
violence and permanent physical injury. The demand was three years in prison and a hospital 
order with mandatory pyschiatric treatment; the sentence was five years in prison.

District Court in The Hague286

There were nine offences in all, including three counts of human trafficking with respect to 
three different victims and five counts of violent offences. In one of the human trafficking of-
fences, rape was included as a means of coercion. The periods of exploitation were five months, 
and three and two weeks, respectively. The demand was four years in prison, with one year sus-
pended, and the special condition of receiving aggression management therapy. The sentence 
was the same.

District Court in Zwolle-Lelystad287

The court convicted of five offences against one victim, who was 15 years of age, including (in 
addition to human trafficking), a violent gang rape. The exploitation lasted 15 months. The 
demand was seven years; the sentence was 40 months in prison.

District Court in Amsterdam288

There were two victims, each exploited in prostitution for almost two –and a half years, in 
which serious threats were made, including the use of a pistol and kicking one of the victims 
on the body. The demand was four years in prison, but the court found that four years was too 
much since the victims were not also made dependent on drugs.

District Court in The Hague289

One woman was locked up and illegally deprived of her liberty. The suspect was also convicted 
for trying to recruit this woman and another woman for the purpose of exploitation in pros-
titution. Four years was demanded and the sentence was three years. The suspect had been 
sentenced to three years in prison for human trafficking not long before.

District Court in Utrecht290

The court found that for eighteen months a slightly mentally impaired girl had been exploited 
in the escort sector by a couple. She had to have unprotected sex and was advertised as such. 
The unprotected sex was declared proven as an attempt to cause grievous bodily harm. The 
public prosecutor demanded a four-year prison sentence and the court imposed three years 
with a reference to what was normally imposed in this type of case.

District Court in Zwolle-Lelystad291

The court convicted a suspect of membership in a criminal organisation with the intention of 
committing human trafficking and being an accessory to human trafficking. The two victims 
came from Bulgaria and there was no violence. The duration of the exploitation was four and 
a half months and one month. The role of the suspect was regarded as minor and the suspect 
had personally reported to the police. An out-of-court settlement of 110 hours of community 
service was offered; the court imposed 110 hours.

District Court in Amsterdam292

There were three victims from Poland, who were exploited for nine, three and two months in 
prostitution, during which time they were repeatedly raped. The rape was charged as a means 
of coercion. The public prosecutor demanded a prison sentence of 24 months. The court took 
account of the fact that at the hearing the suspect appeared to have repented and imposed 18 
months.

District Court in The Hague293

The suspect had exploited four women in prostitution for nine, five and four months and some 
of the victims had been forced to perform unsafe sex. Serious violence was used. The public 
prosecutor demanded six years in prison and the court imposed 42 months.

District Court in The Hague294

A victim from Romania was exploited for four days. The public prosecutor demanded a prison 
sentence of four months, with two of them suspended, and the court ruled accordingly with 
respect to Article 273f (1) (1), (3) and (9) Dutch Criminal Code, taking into account the short 
period of the exploitation.

Determining the sentence is difficult and a comparison of judgments like the one above 
might not entirely reflect the considerations that are made. Furthermore, many judgments 
encompass a number of offences, making it impossible to establish which part of the sen-
tence relates specifically to those relating to human trafficking. Other factors also play a role,

such as the attitude of the suspects at the trial. Nevertheless, orientation points do seem to be 
needed for the punishment of offences under Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code.

11.10 Compensation and deprivation of illegally obtained profits

11.10.1 Claims for compensation

If victims wish to join as an injured party on the grounds of Articles 51a to 51f in conjunction 
with Article 361 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure, they can do so before295 or during296 
the hearing of the criminal case. Joining as an injured party in the criminal proceedings is a 
civil claim for the victim embedded in the criminal process. The claim is therefore governed 
by the material rules of civil law on the grounds of unlawful act. The court can make an order 
to pay compensation at the request of the injured party, on demand by the public prosecutor 
or ex officio.297 The study of the case law in §11.10.2 shows that an order to pay compensation 
is almost always issued together with the awarding of a claim for compensation. The Central 
Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) collects the compensation for the victim.NRM5 (On this point, 
see §4.4.)
In 2007, 40 alleged victims of human trafficking298 filed claims for compensation. Three 
claims were connected with both the human trafficking offence and another offence that 
was charged simultaneously. These three claims are not included here because it is not clear 
which part of the claims related to the human trafficking offences. The survey therefore 
cover 37 (14%) of the 257 alleged human trafficking victims in 2007 who submitted claims 
as injured parties in first instance exclusively in relation to the charges of human trafficking. 
The amount claimed in 11 of these claims is not known,299 so the amount of the claim is only 
specified in 26 instances.300

Claims that are submitted are sometimes broken down into claims for emotional injury (26 
times, of which 19 claims are known) and material damage (between 17 and 21 times,301 of 
which 16 claims are known). However, in some cases the claim is described as covering emo-
tional injury and material damage, but it is unclear from the judgment which part of the claim 
is for emotional injury and which part is for material damage (11 times, of which seven claims 
are known). In this section, these cases are referred to as ‘combined claims’.

295 Article 51b, (1) Dutch Criminal Code.
296 Article 51b, (2) Dutch Criminal Code.
297 Article 36f Dutch Criminal Code. The order can be made if and insofar as the defendant is liable to the vic-

tim under civil law for the damage caused by the criminal offence, Article 36f (2) Dutch Criminal Code.
298 Actually 43 alleged human trafficking victims, but three of these claims were not related to the human traf-

ficking but to another offence charged at the same time, so they are ignored here.
299 In these cases, the judgments refer only to a submitted claim, but it is not specified.
300 The amount claimed is based on the amount that was claimed by the victim in first instance.
301 Of one unknown claim it is certain that it concerned a claim for material damage and of four unknown claims 

this cannot be stated with certainty.

Table 11.27 shows that the average amount claimed for emotional injury was €9,452.95, which 
is more than double the average claim for material damages of €4,356.28. By comparison, 
the average combined claim (based on only seven claims) is remarkably high at €39,662.86, 
which can be explained by the outlier,310 the maximum claim of €123,640 in this category. The 
victims who submitted a claim, where the amount of those claims is apparent from the judg-
ment, claimed an average of €20,261.79, with a minimum amount of €350 and a maximum 
of €123,640.

310 An outlier is a value that differs by a significant amount from the average and so can greatly influence the 

average, especially when it is an average based on a small sample. In this case the average is based on only 
seven values, so that the maximum claim of €123,640, the outlier in this case, greatly increases the average.

468

There were 37 claims divided among 26 (24%) of the 108 human trafficking judgments ana-
lysed. The total amount claimed is unknown in seven judgments, so the total amount claimed 
is only known for 19 judgments. The average total amount claimed per judgment in which 
one or more victims submitted a claim and all the claims are known is €26,884.55, with a 
minimum amount of €350 and a maximum amount of €127,500. The highest claim in 2007 
was the following.

District court in The Hague311

‘(victim), (…), has joined as injured party with respect to the claim for damages in the amount 
of €123,640. This claim is partially supported by the documents attached to the joinder form 
and submitted at the hearing, while that part of the claim, which is simple in nature, is directly 
based – as shown by the examination at the hearing – on the offence with which the suspect 
was charged and convicted under 1. The court will therefore decide that the claim of the injured 
party is partially admissible and shall partially award this claim.
The court will award the claim of the injured party, insofar as the claim relates to the emotional 
injury sustained, for an amount of €5,000, by way of advance; insofar as the claim relates to 
travel costs incurred for making the complaint, €140.
The court will declare the rest of the claim of the injured party inadmissible, since that part of 
the claim is not so straightforward in nature that it can be dealt with in the criminal proceed-
ings. The order to pay compensation will also be imposed.

The nature of the claims (emotional injury, material damage) is usually not further specified 
in the judgements. There is more information in the judgments about the background or 
underpinning of the claim for only seven of the claims. In two cases, emotional injury was 
claimed because the victim had sustained injury related to the offence. Material damage was 
claimed in three cases as loss of income/confiscation of money, and twice as compensation 
of the costs of legal assistance.

11.10.2 Awarding of claims for compensation

Of the 37 claims submitted (100%), 21 (57%) were awarded, two of them entirely and 19 par-
tially.

In Table 11.28, the average amounts of compensation awarded are broken down by emotional 
injury, material damage, the combination of the two and the total.

tion for this is that only four (25%) of the 16 claims for material damage were awarded, par-

victims who were awarded their claims for compensation was €4,401.05, with a minimum of 
€70 and a maximum of €27,592.

The 21 claims were awarded in 16 (84%) of the 19 judgements in which a claim for compen-
sation relating exclusively to human trafficking was submitted. The average total amount

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

470

District Court in Zwolle-Lelystad320

‘In the investigation during the hearing it was established that the injured party (…) sustained 
direct damage as a result of the offences with which the suspect was charged and which were 
declared proven under 1 and 2. The amount of that damage has, in light of the content of the 
“form for joinder of injured party in the criminal proceedings” and of what emerged during 
the investigation during the hearing, been satisfactorily established as an amount of €27,592 
(€20,000 in material damage, €7,500 for emotional injury and €92 in legal costs), plus the costs 
which are estimated, up to today, at nil.
The claims of the injured party, whose claim is declared admissible, can as such be awarded.
In the court’s opinion, the injured party’s claim (…), insofar as more is claimed, is not so simple 
in nature that it can be dealt with in the criminal proceedings. The district court will therefore 
decide that that part of the injured party’s claim is inadmissible and that part of the claim can 
only be brought before the civil court.
The court shall also, with respect to the offences declared proven under 1 and 2, impose on the 
suspect, on the grounds of Article 36f of the Dutch Criminal Code, the obligation to pay the 
State said sum of €27,592 for the benefit of the victim (…).’

While the nature of the compensation awarded (emotional injury, material damage) is not 
always specified in the judgments,321 more information about the nature of the compensation 
is provided in 18 judgments. In eleven cases compensation for emotional injury was awarded 
to the victim because this damage had, in fairness, been established; in three cases, because 
the proven offence violated the physical and psychological integrity of the victim; and twice, 
because it had been established that the relevant offence had caused damage to the victim. 
Compensation for material damage was awarded once to compensate for travel costs in-
curred to report the crime and once as compensation for legal assistance.
In all 21 claims for compensation (partially or wholly awarded), the court issued an order to 
pay compensation. This means that the State collects the amount on behalf of the victim (see 
§4.4).

11.10.3 Grounds for rejection or declaration of inadmissibility of claims

Of the 37 claims for compensation that were submitted exclusively in relation to human traf-
ficking offences, 35 denied – 19 partially and 16 entirely. These claims were either rejected 
or declared inadmissible. In five cases, a claim was partially rejected and declared partially 
inadmissible. The grounds given in the judgments for the rejection and declaration of inad-
missibility of claims are set out in Table 11.29.

320 Zwolle-Lelystad District Court, 24 May 2007, unpublished.
321 This distinction can be found in the joinder form. However, the case files were not examined.

Table 11.29 shows that the majority of the claims were not awarded (at least partially) because 
the claims were not simple enough to be dealt with at the trial. A victim can then still submit 
that part of the claim to the civil-law courts. If a claim is rejected on one of the three other 
grounds shown in the table, this possibility no longer exists.

11.10.4 The application for deprivation of illegally obtained profits

The introduction of the ‘Pluck Them’ legislation created the possibility of deprivating ille-
gally obtained benefits from convicted persons.324 On an application by the public prosecu-
tor, the court can issue a confiscation order against the convicted person in the form of a 
separate judicial decision,325 although that does not mean that the deprivation order cannot 
be handled at the same time as the main trial.326 Often, however, especially in larger and more 
complicated cases, the application for deprivation will be brought later. The public prosecu-
tor must indicate during the trial, before the closing statement, whether an application for a 
deprivation order will be submitted. During the hearing on the application for deprivation, 
the judge then estimates the illegally earned benefits that the convicted person obtained as 
a result of the offence.327 The public prosecutor will generally submit a financial report to 
support the claim.328

322 The five claims that were partially rejected and partially declared inadmissible were dismissed on the grounds 
of ‘damage not imputable to the suspect’, and ‘claim not simple in natue’. In this table, these five claims are 
included under the ground for rejection ‘damage not imputable to suspect’. However, some should actually 
fall under the ground of inadmissibility. Since this would lead to total percentage of 114%, it was decided to 
present these five claims only between brackets under the ground of inadmissibility.

323 See previous footnote.
324 The underlying idea for confiscating the illegally earned benefits is to send a signal that crime doesn’t pay 

and to hit criminals where it hurts: in their pockets.

prosecution service should make such a calculation.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

The point that financial investigations should also be conducted in human trafficking cases 
was already made in NRM5 (and is included in the Instruction on Human Trafficking). The 
cases of deprivation that were studied generally involved money earned by the victim in 
prostitution, with the deduction of costs incurred that are directly related to the offence.329 
The court has great freedom in determining that. An extravagant life style does not neces-
sarily fall under it.330 The District Court in The Hague331 issued a confiscation order for a sum 
of €108,000 and calculated this on the basis of the number of victims, the days worked, the 
estimated number of clients and the period of exploitation in prostitution, with deduction of 
costs as illustrated below.

Complainant [A]
1.  The convicted person allowed complainant to work for him from 11 October 2006 to 1 

November 2006, that is three weeks.
2. Complainant had two clients a day.
3. Complainant asked €100 per client.
4.  Although complainant says that she worked every day, the order is based on six working 

days.

Complainant [B]
5.  The complainant worked for the convicted person from May 2006 to 20 November 2006, 

that is 13 weeks.
6. Complainant received six clients a day.
7. Complainant received €100 per client.
8. The calculation is based on six working days per week.

Costs
9.  Complainants declared that the convicted person bought necessities for work such as 

condoms, sponges and lingerie for them. Interviewing officer estimated these costs at 
€1,000.

10.  The agreements with clients were made by telephone and the suspect also checked up on 
the women by telephone. Interviewing officer estimates these costs at €1,000.

11.  The court has observed that both complainants stated that the convicted person gave them 
money for groceries and sometimes to go out. The court will fix these costs at €1,600

Benefit [A]: Three weeks x six days x two clients x €100 = €3,600
Benefit [B]:  30 weeks x six days x six clients x €100 = €108,000
Costs:  1000 + 1000 + 1600 = €3,600.

jured party a sum of €13,215 (see Article 36f Dutch Criminal Code). Neither the judgment of the Den Bosch 
District Court nor that of Den Bosch Court of Appeal in the main case is published, so it was impossible to 
discover how the size of the claim awarded to the injured party was established), and Utrecht District Court,

473

Table 11.28 shows that the average amount of compensation awarded to victims does not of-
ten come in the neighbourhood of that amount. Claims for material damage relating to loss 
of income are usually declared inadmissible as not being easy to calculate.

Nevertheless, there are examples of claims being awarded for loss of income by injured par-
ties being awarded, as for instance by the District Court in Utrecht,332 where the court appar-
ently calculated the loss of income without a financial report (the periods involved were five 
and seven days). The court also awarded a sum for the removal of tattoos. In another case, 
the District Court in Utrecht333 awarded a sum of €33,309.85 for loss of income. In that case, 
the court had a financial report, which showed an income of €95,171. The court awarded 35% 
of that as loss of income, since the victim would not have earned any more if she had worked 
for a legitimate escort agency.
The court then decided on the deprivation claim, in which it followed the report drawn up on 
the criminal financial investigation as regards the costs.
The court estimated the deductible costs at a total of €24,578 for the costs of a car, working 
clothes and accommodation and fixed the unlawful earnings at €70,593.00. The court also 
found as follows: “In the principal case, the court has attributed 35% of the gross income to 
the injured party [victim], as being her share of the earnings/work in prostitution, i.e. a sum 
of €33,309.85. In the court’s opinion, this amount should be deducted from the benefit of 
€70,593.00. The court therefore fixes the total unlawfully earned benefit at €37,283.15”. This 
amount is therefore due to the State and concerns the income earned by the victim. That can 
surely not be the intention.

If a victim is sold to another trafficker for a certain amount of money, it is clear that this 
amount should be taken from the trafficker as illegally obtained. Question is wether this 
amount must be considered as damage of the victim that should as such be refunded. 

11.10.5 Improvements

Practice, therefore, shows that it is difficult for victims of human trafficking to claim their 
loss of income from sexual exploitation. Findings from the study of case law (see §11.10.1) 
show that only 35 (14%) of all 257 victims submitted a claim for compensation, and only a 
small number of that 14% had their claims ultimately awarded by the courts; the vast major-
ity of the claims for compensation were only partially awarded or not awarded at all.334

332 Utrecht District Court, 16 July 2009, LJN: BJ3128.
333 Utrecht District Court, 10 December 2008, LJN: BG6680. In two criminal cases of forced prostitution (two 

suspects, the same facts), Utrecht District Court (both 10 December 2008, LJN: BG6680, BG6681, BG6682 
and BG6683) also handled the compensation for the injured party and the order for confiscation. The court 
expressly took the criminal financial investigation as the point of departure for its calculation. The criminal 
financial investigation included the notes that the victim herself had kept and the agenda that was kept by the 
suspect and co-suspect over the period that they had caused the victim to work as a prostitute.

334 The study of case law shows that the reason for this is mainly the inadmissibility of the claim for compensa-
tion because the nature of the claim is not simple.

The successful deprivation cases show that the financial report makes an important contri-
bution to helping the court to establish the income from prostitution. With such a financial 
report, the victim’s material damage is easier to establish, as the example described earlier 
showed.
To improve the position of the victim in this regard, the financial report should also be avail-
able to the victim. This could be done, for example, by adding the report to the criminal file 
during the hearing of the principal case or by making it available to the victim. In the case of 
a claim for deprivation of illegally earned benefits, the application for deprivation could also 
always be made at the same time as the criminal case, so that the judge deciding on the in-
jured party’s claim is immediately aware of the financial report. Because this does not always 
happen, the possibility should be created for adjourning the injured party’s claim – which 
has been submitted during the criminal action – to be dealt with at the same time as the ap-
plication for deprivation. The law should be changed to allow this.

The OSCE’s report Compensation for Trafficked and Exploited Persons in the OSCE Region 
(2008) shows that securing compensation is also a problem for victims in other countries.335 
There are procedures under criminal, civil and labour law, and in some countries compen-
sation funds (as in the Netherlands), but nevertheless, it is difficult for victims to receive 
compensation for damage, either from the offender or from the State. In this context, the 
OSCE, UNHCHR and the Council of Europe recommend using proceeds from crime 
(‘criminal assets’) to compensate victims or establishing funds to help and to rehabilitate 
victims.336

11.11 Conclusions

This section indicates where there are problems in relation to the topics discusses in this 
chapter and describes the issues that require special attention.

Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code is not a straightforward article. It contains many 
sections and is multilayered. The history of international treaties is also relevant for the in-
terpretation and application of this provision, as is knowledge of the methods used by perpe-
trators and the problems facing victims.
The investigation into Dutch case law on human trafficking in the sex industry shows that 
various legal issues are sometimes treated differently and that the context of violence, 
coercion, deception and the possibility for victims to escape from their situation is not 
uniformly evaluated. Statements by victims, and, above all, the internal consistency, play

The UN Convention on combating organised crime in fact provides the member states – insofar as this is 
possible under national law – should primarily consider returning incomes from crimes that are seized to the 
requesting state so that they can compensate the victims of crimes, see Article. 14 (2) of the UN Convention 
on prevention of organised crime.

an important role when the evidence is being weighed. It is noteworthy in this context 
that the judge sometimes actively looks for an explanation for the inconsistencies in the 
vitims’statements. This suggests that in these instances the judges have recognised the spe-
cific problems associated with the statements of victims in human trafficking cases. The 
impression to emerge from the almost 200 judgments since January 2007 that were studied 
is that even where there is a finding that coercion has been proved, the Dutch prostitution 
policy sometimes seems to play a role in the evaluation of whether a victim could reason-
ably have made a different choice. This is perhaps explicable on the grounds of the explana-
tory memorandum of the original proposal for article 273a of the (old) Dutch Criminal 
Code, in which the comparison was made with the ‘articulate Dutch prostitute’. However, 
this comparison can only refer to the situation where the prostitute is already working in 
prostitution and cannot be a factor in assessing the ‘freedom of choice’ to enter prostitu-
tion. The number of acquittals in human trafficking cases is high, even by comparison with 
the number of acquittals in rape cases, for example. Contrary to what might be expected, 
the study showed that this is only partially due to a lack of reliable statements by victims 
and witnesses.

For some years now there has been talk of establishing a course in human trafficking. The 
Training and Study Centre for the Judiciary (SSR) has meanwhile devised a basic and an ad-
vanced course. The original idea was for a course made up of six modules, covering interna-
tional legislation, the immigration law background, the social context and the legal problems 
and concluding with a professional meeting. The course has not yet been launched, however, 
and judges only occasionally participate in the courses that are currently offered.
There is no specialisation in human trafficking in the judiciary, but the public prosecution 
service has now begun to appoint regional public prosecutors who specialise in hman traf-
ficking.
The number of human trafficking cases brought before the district courts has ranged from 
100 to 150 a year in the last few years. Dividing them among 19 courts does not promote the 
accumulation and retention of sufficient knowledge and expertise. Concentrating human 
trafficking cases in a few courts would enhance the creation and retention of that expertise.

The BNRM study showed that both the sentences demanded and the sentences imposed 
in human trafficking cases vary. There seems to be a need for guidelines. Basic principles 
for the appropriate sentence for human trafficking were formulated for the first time in the 
Sneep case: a prison sentence of eight to 10 months for each victim, depending on the dura-
tion of the exploitation, the level of violence used and the role of the suspect. In that context, 
a period of exploitation of nine months was regarded as ‘relatively short’. Interestingly, ag-
gravating circumstances are seldom explicitly mentioned either by the public prosecution 
service in the indictment or by the judge in the particulars of the offence. BNRM did not 
include pre-trial detention in the study. What the judgments did show is that 30% of the de-
fendants and 28% of those convicted were not being held in preventive custody at the time of 
the trial. BNRM intends to study this subject in more depth.

Studying the judgments in criminal trials yields a lot of information. For example, most of 
the judgments in 2007 involved human trafficking cases in which victims were forced to work 
in prostitution in the Netherlands. Almost three-quarters of the convicted perpetrators were 
pimps. Half were involved in recruiting victims and 35% escorted victims to the Netherlands 
from other countries. Roughly a quarter had to guard the victims and slightly less than a 
fifth were responsible for transporting the victims to and from the workplace. A minority of 
the perpetrators, 5%, operated a sex business. These perpetrators often performed several 
different roles. It is not possible to tell whether the sex businesses were licensed, unlicensed 
or illegal.

The judgments that were studied show that it is particularly difficult for victims to recover 
reparation for material damage, which is often loss of income. In the majority of the judg-
ments these claims (or this part of the claim) were felt to be too complicated and the claims 
were declared inadmissible. Nevertheless, a slight change has been apparent in more recent 
judgments, particularly when a financial report has been prepared for the claim for the dep-
rivation of illegally obtained profits and it is available at the time of the trial. One problem, 
however, is that the application for deprivation of assets is not submitted at the time of the 
principal case. This could be improved. The financial report for the judge could also be sub-
mitted for a decision on the injured party’s claim. Finally, the injured party’s claim, submit-
ted for the hearing of the main case, could also be adjourned to be dealt with at the same time 
as the later deprivation claim. The law would have to be amended to allow this.

The study of the case law shows that in cases where the court declared that an attempt had 
been proved, there was in fact usually a completed offence. Scarcely any prosecutions were 
found for a ‘genuine’ attempt. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court on at-
tempted human trafficking does leave open the possibility to use this charge more often.
It could have a preventive effect if a successful prosecution could take pace at an earlier 
stage.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

12.1  Introduction

Since the article on human trafficking was expanded to include exploitation in sectors other 
than the sex industry (‘other forms of exploitation’), there has been growing interest in this 
area, particularly from the media and the police. Studies are also being carried out and spe-
cial training courses have been developed for professionals on the subject of other forms 
of expoitation. The American Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report on the Netherlands, pub-
lished in the summer of 2009, also devoted a conspicuous amount of attention to other forms 
of exploitation, and all of the recommendations made in the report concerned other forms of 
exploitation.1 A number of conferences and expert meetings on exploitation outside the sex 
industry have also been organised, both in the Netherlands and abroad.2

It has been almost five years since other forms of exploitation were criminalised, and the 
problems are becoming increasingly evident. It emerged, for instance, during the conference 
organised by BNRM and the University of Utrecht that there is still a lot of uncertainty about 
the dividing line between bad employment practices and exploitation, a boundary that has 
to be defined by the courts. That definition, and certainty about it, is essential for investiga-
tions. Ambiguities surrounding the meaning and scope of the means of coercion ‘abusing a 
vulnerable position’ have also played a role in the case law to date. Enquiries in other coun-
tries indicate that they are struggling with similar problems.
On paper, efforts to tackle other forms of exploitation have intensified, and while practical 
measures lag behind, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of prosecutions. 
This is despite the fact that uncertainty about the difference between bad employment prac-
tices and exploitation, and the small number of convictions to date,3 do not provide motiva-
tion for identification and investigation.
This chapter (of the English edition) opens with a discussion of some high-risk groups and 
then goes on to survey the case law on other forms of exploitation.

1 Two of the recommendations also pertain to sexual exploitation. The recommendations read: “Vigorous-
ly investigate and prosecute, and convict and punish labour trafficking offenders; enhance forced labour 
awareness training for prosecutors and judges; continue anti-trafficking awareness initiatives aimed at edu-
cating clients of the commercial sex trade as well as beneficiaries of forced labour about the causes and 
consequences of trafficking; continue efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims in the prostitution 
and relevant labour sectors of the Netherlands.” (Trafficking in Persons Report, 2009, pp. 218-220). 

2 The large number of people who registered for the international conference organised by BNRM and the 
University of Utrecht (‘Human trafficking, turning our attention to labour exploitation’) in February 2009 
indicates the level of interest in the subject. 

3 At the time of writing (August 2009), three cases had resulted in convictions for other forms of exploitation. 
For a discussion of the cases, see §12.6.

The term ‘other forms of exploitation’
In this report, ‘other forms of exploitation’ refers to all forms of exploitation outside the sex 
industry. This could include exploitation in domestic service, agriculture and horticulture, the 
catering and hospitality sector, in criminal activities, etc. For a non-exhaustive list of types of 
exploitation that fall within the scope of ‘other forms of exploitation’, see Chapter 8 of the fifth 
report of the NRM. Organ trafficking does not fall under BNRM’s definition of other forms 
of exploitation.4

12.2 	 Identification	and	perception

In Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code, the provision that makes human trafficking a 
criminal offence, the legislature makes no distinction between human trafficking in the sense 
of sexual exploitation and human trafficking in the sense of other forms of exploitation. Both 
forms of human trafficking constitute the same criminal offence and the sentences are the 
same for both. The B9 regulation also makes no distinction between victims of sexual ex-
ploitation and other forms of exploitation. The training courses on human trafficking pro-
vided for members of the police, special investigative services and government inspector-
ates, the public prosecution service and the judiciary also cover both types of exploitation. 
Nevertheless, situations involving or potentially involving other forms of exploitation are 
still dealt with differently than instances of sexual exploitation in practice. For example, it 
regularly occurs that indications of other forms of exploitation are not recognised, reported 
and followed up. The number of prosecutions for other forms of exploitation still contrasts 
starkly with the number of prosecutions for sexual exploitation. Victims and potential vic-
tims of other forms of exploitation are also often treated differently to victims of sexual ex-
ploitation. For example, victims of other forms of exploitation are not always recognised as 
victims and are consequently not informed of their rights under the B9 regulation or offered 
a period for reflection. Occasionally, (potential) victims of other forms of exploitation are 
placed in aliens detention, whereas for (potential) victims of sexual exploitation an immedi-
ate effort is made to find them a place in a shelter.
So although the legislation and the rules make no distinction between sexual and other forms 
of exploitation, there are differences in how they are dealt with in practice. These discrepan-
cies are due to differences in the perception of sexual and other forms of exploitation. The 
following case highlights the aspects of the identification, investigation and prosecution of 
other forms of exploitation and the treatment of potential victims where this perception can 
have a significant impact.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

Exploitation on an asparagus farm in Someren
The Labour Inspectorate, the local municipality and the police had been aware for years of 
irregularities at J’s asparagus farm in Someren. Every season, several dozen foreign workers 
were employed at the farm. Over a period of several years, the Labour Inspectorate had fined 
J five times for violations of the Foreign Nationals Employment Act and the Minimum Wage 
Act, among other things. The total amount of the fines was € 566,250.5

In the course of several years the police had received several complaints of assault, intimida-
tion, the non-payment of full wages and the withholding of identity papers at the asparagus 
farm. The municipality was also aware of a number of irregularities at the farm, including 
the fact that the accommodation for the farm workers did not comply with fire safety regula-
tions.
That last point (the violation of fire safety regulations) ultimately caused the municipality 
to intervene. Supported by a judgment of the preliminary relief judge6 in favour of the mu-
nicipality and after consulting the ‘law and order triumvirate’ (the mayor, the police superin-
tendent and the chief public prosecutor for the region), the municipality decided to evacuate 
the farm on 15 May on the grounds of violation of the Housing Act by means of an admin-
istrative enforcement measure. Although it had also emerged during the hearing before the 
preliminary relief judge the week before that the workers were locked in at night and that one 
of the labour migrants had made a complaint of assault to the police,7 it was still decided to 
proceed against J with an administrative enforcement measure and not under criminal law.
Approximately 55 workers, most of them Romanian, were discovered during the action.8 The 
mayor, who was present during the raid, made a statement to the press about the conditions 
in which the workers were found: “They could not leave the site during the entire period they 
worked there. They earned far less than they were promised. Their employer forced them 
to buy their food on the farm for a lot of money.”9 “The sanitary facilities and the food were 
dreadful. The people had to buy vouchers for food and shampoo on the farm at enormous 
prices”.10 About the working conditions, he went on: “They reminded me more of a form of 
slavery than those of a modern company”.11

Although there had been at least six known indications of human trafficking12 the workers 
were not advised of their rights to a reflection period under the B9 regulation during the

12 The following indicators of human trafficking from the Instruction on Human Trafficking, Government 

Gazette 2008, 253, appendix 3, were already known to the agencies concerned from observations by the 
agencies themselves or from reports by third parties to the agencies before the administrative enforcement 
action took place: spending the night in the workplace; the victim cannot or is not allowed to have contact 
with the outside world; the victim does not have possession of his own identity papers; the victim receives an

action.13 The workers were also not interviewed separately; instead, the Labour Inspectorate 
took all their statements together in the same room by giving them a form to fill in. When 
a great many of the workers said they did not want to return to J’s farm, they were offered 
shelter on a campsite. The workers were not reported to CoMensha. Although they were 
still owed wages by J, because they were only to be paid at the end of the season, 36 of the 
Romanian workers preferred to return to Romania without their money rather than return 
to J’s farm.14 The municipality then arranged a bus for them. Before they boarded the bus to 
return to Romania, the municipality made them sign an agreement that they would repay the 
cost of the journey to the municipality. The group left for home that same day. No action had 
been taken against J under criminal law at that time. A number of workers opted to continue 
working on J’s asparagus farm.

After some time, the public prosecution service decided to carry out an investigation into 
human trafficking. At that time, the National Public Prosecutor’s Office for Financial, Eco-
nomic and Environmental Offences was already heading an investigation into violations of 
the Economic Offences Act. It was decided to split the criminal investigation into two parts: 
the public prosecutor responsible for human trafficking would head an investigation into 
human trafficking by the local office of the public prosecution service, while the Office for 
Financial, Economic and Environmental Offences would lead the investigation into the eco-
nomic offences. There would be one writ of summons and one court hearing, but with two 
public prosecutors, one each from the local office and from the Office for Financial, Eco-
nomic and Environmental Offences.
As already mentioned, a number of workers chose to continue working at J’s farm, since 
they were only to be paid at the end of the season and would be left empty-handed if they left 
sooner. It is noteworthy that several weeks after the evacuation of the farm, the municipality 
gave permission for these workers to be housed in tents on J’s farm. Also remarkable is the 
fact that at the end of May the employee insurance implementing agency (UWV) granted 35 
work permits that J had applied for, even though workers had earlier been found working 
there under dreadful conditions and J was the subject of a criminal investigation.15 At a later 
stage, the workers who stayed behind were informed of their rights under the B9 regulation. 
At the time of writing, it was not known whether they had availed of them.

This case illustrates the fact that problems occur at different levels. Although policies and 
legislation have been developed to address other forms of exploitation, it is noteworthy that 
rules are not always followed, partly as a result of the prevailing perception of other forms 

unusually low wage compared with the market; the victim works exceptionally long working days or working 
weeks; and the victim is threatened or confronted with violence.

13 It follows from the B9 regulation: “Even at the slightest [italics: BNRM] indication of human trafficking the 
police must inform the alien of the possibility of reporting the crime or otherwise cooperating with a crimi-
nal investigation into human trafficking.”

of exploitation. The Labour Inspectorate should obviously report indications of human traf-
ficking to the SIOD/EMM.16 That did not happen in this case, although several indications of 
human trafficking were evidently known to the Labour Inspectorate, since J had been fined 
five times. The police also failed to pick up signs of human trafficking that it received over 
an extended period of time. The workers were also not reported to CoMensha. Another 
striking feature of the case is that the workers were not informed of their rights under the B9 
regulation either before or during the enforcement action, even though that should be done 
when there is even the slightest indication of human trafficking.

Victims of other forms of exploitation and the B9 regulation
As already mentioned in Chapter 5, it is remarkable that the Labour Inspectorate and special 
investigative services are not mentioned in the B9 regulation, for example with respect to 
illegal aliens who are discovered during administrative or police checks.17 The B9 regula-
tion states that the police must inform the alien concerned of the rights laid down in the B9 
regulation (including the reflection period) if there is the slightest indication of human traf-
ficking. The Labour Inspectorate and the SIOD should also have a more clearly defined role 
(and responsibility) for aliens who are found in workplaces and are not living legally in the 
Netherlands if there are signs of human trafficking.

Finally, the fact that the municipality prevented an intervention under criminal law in prefer-
ence for administrative enforcement is remarkable in light of the approach to human traf-
ficking, since an administrative action against a violation of fire safety regulations does not 
preclude an intervention under criminal law for human trafficking. The fact that the media 
scarcely mentioned the term human trafficking also illustrates how this case was perceived. 
The key to the problem is that, although there were various indications of human traffick-
ing, the situation was not regarded as a possible case of exploitation. The case was seen as a 
series of separate situations involving violations of labour and administrative law. Even the 
assaults reported to the police were seen as isolated incidents. Because the various agencies 
did not connect the various events, either internally or in consultation with other agencies, 
they failed to see the full context of the potential case of exploitation.
The problems observed in the above case have also been seen (individually or in combination) 
in others cases known to BNRM and highlight the perception of other forms of exploitation. 
This has created the impression that economic exploitation is seen as a ‘less serious’ form 
of exploitation than sexual exploitation, as became clear during a meeting of the council of 
immigration judges.18 Victims of sexual exploitation who are found in a brothel, for example, 
will obviously not be placed first in aliens detention. It also seems that there are or could be 
practical problems in finding shelter for victims of other forms of exploitation, especially 

16 Instruction on Human Trafficking, Government Gazette 2008, no 253, appendix 3.
17 The term ‘Labour Inspectorate’ does not appear in the regulation at all. 
18 The immigration judges also have a different perception of victims of other forms of exploitation than of 

victims of sexual exploitation. The aspect of their illegal residence and the accompanying risk that they will 
disappear again also seems to be a factor.

since the numbers involved are often large.19 Naturally, such practical problems may never 
be a reason for deciding not to follow the statutory procedure. Furthermore, other forms of 
exploitation are also violations of human rights; it is also essential to provide adequate shel-
ter for victims of this serious criminal offence.

Self-identification by victims
Quite apart from the fact that victims of other forms of exploitation are regularly not rec-
ognised as such by the relevant agencies, another problem is that they often do not regard 
themselves as victims of human trafficking. Victims from other countries, in particular, are 
generally unaware of their rights and it is difficult for them to assess whether they are vic-
tims of exploitation. The National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings therefore 
made the following recommendation in her fifth report: “Since people are more vulnerable 
to exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry if they are unaware of their rights, more 
needs to be done to inform those who have a marginal position on the labour market, and in 
society, about their basic labour rights. The government has an important part to play here.” 
To increase awareness among potential victims of exploitation or of other abuses, at the be-
ginning of 2009 the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment produced the fact sheet 
‘Exploitation at the Workplace’. The fact sheet presents examples of exploitation, briefly ex-
plains the rights of victims of human trafficking and gives the names and telephone numbers 
of relevant agencies. The leaflet has been published in fourteen languages and is distributed 
by NGOs, organisations that provide help to victims and municipalities.20 Partly as a result 
of the case in Someren, existing leaflets about living and working in the Netherlands and 
about the Minimum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act have been translated into 
Bulgarian and Romanian. The leaflets will be distributed in those countries after the sum-
mer of 2009.21

To make the police, Labour Inspectorate, the SIOD and the Royal Netherlands Marechaus-
see more alert to human trafficking, the Ministries of Justice, Social Affairs and Employ-
ment, and the Interior and Kingdom Relations have jointly produced an introductory film on 
the subject.22 BLinN is also trying to increase access to victims by improving the expertise of 
agencies involved with other forms of exploitation with the project ‘Signaleren en informer-
en van moeilijk bereikbare slachtoffers van mensenhandel’.23 BLinN also intends to provide 
direct support for victims of other forms of exploitation with this project.

19 In the Sneep case (see also Chapter 8), which also involved an enormous number of victims, that problem 
was dealt with proactively and adequately.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

483

The following case is an example of how an investigation into other forms of exploitation 
was handled well in practice and shows how good agreements between the various investiga-
tive agencies led to the correct treatment of the (possible) victims.

Case of Indonesian kitchen workers24

In the summer of 2009, the SIOD and the aliens police searched a house where Indonesians, 
who were living illegally in the Netherlands, were employed preparing Indonesian food un-
der atrocious conditions. The 11 Indonesian ‘employees’ paid a high price to rent a mattress 
in the house. One of their jobs was to prepare shrimp crackers in temperatures that some-
times reached 50 degrees. The house was full of vermin and constituted a fire hazard because 
of exposed electric wires.
From the beginning of the investigation in this case, clear agreements were made between 
the actors. For example, before the house was searched the SIOD and the aliens police agreed 
on their respective tasks. If it was solely a case of illegal workers, the aliens police would take 
the lead and the illegal aliens would be placed in aliens detention. If there were also poor 
working conditions, the SIOD would take the lead and investigate whether there was human 
trafficking. The municipal Urban Development department was also involved because of the 
fire hazard and the overcrowding.
After they were detained by the police, the workers who were discovered during the search 
were immediately offered the reflection period they were entitled to under the B9 regulation 
as (possible) victims of human trafficking. Four of these potential victims availed of their 
right to a reflection period, the others decided to return to Indonesia. All of the potential 
victims were immediately reported to CoMensha. However, because it could not immedi-
ately find places in a shelter for the four potential victims of other forms of exploitation, the 
SIOD itself felt compelled to find and pay for shelter for them in a hotel, and later in a holiday 
park.25 After more than a week, CoMensha found places for them in a shelter. Remarkably, 
however, the shelter was just two streets away from the house where the victims had worked 
and been exploited, so they found themselves in an environment where they felt unsafe.
Meanwhile, the National Public Prosecutor’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environ-
mental Offences had started a criminal investigation into human trafficking, among other 
offences. To provide a clear impression of the dreadful conditions in which the victims had 
to work, it produced an official report of the environment in which they worked with photos 
and films of the location. The Occupational Health and Safety Inspectorate was called in 
to prepare a report on the working conditions. All of the (possible) victims were also inter-
viewed at length. The interviews were filmed. The investigation was still underway when this

This case shows that clear agreements on the division of tasks between the various agencies 
(in this case, the SIOD, the aliens police, the Urban Development department and the public 
prosecution service’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Offences) ensures 
good cooperation and prevents (possible) victims from falling through gaps in their respec-
tive responsibilities. One point requiring attention is that there was no place immediately 
available in a shelter for the victims reported to CoMensha. Making an official report of the 
scene with photos and films could be prove to be a useful instrument in helping the court to 
arrive at a decision when the case comes to trial.

12.3 A few high-risk sectors and high-risk groups

The NRM’s fifth report contains a lengthy discussion of sectors that are vulnerable to other 
forms of exploitation. This section contains an update of developments in specific high-risk 
sectors: the employment agency sector, domestic services and agriculture and horticulture.26 
Marriage as a form or element of human trafficking is discussed in §12.5.4.  
The various investigative services have devoted special attention to the high-risk sectors. For 
example, the Labour Inspectorate has long regarded the construction industry, the employ-
ment-agency sector, agriculture and horticulture and the catering and hospitality sectors as 
high-risk. The public prosecution service has started a pilot project concerning exploitation 
in Chinese hospitality businesses and employment agencies.27 Other high-risk sectors iden-
tified by BNRM also receive special attention from the investigative services.

12.3.1 Mala fide employment agencies

Illegal labour migrants have to overcome many hurdles in order to stay in the Netherlands. 
As a result, they can, in a number of respects, become dependent on mala fide employment 
agencies that play a facilitating role for them.28 Research conducted by BNRM for the previ-
ous reportNRM5 indicated that gangmasters (from the Netherlands and other countries) and 
mala fide employment agencies hire illegal immigrants. They also trade documents and are 
guilty of failing to pay their workers properly and of housing them in abominable condi-
tions. Mala fide employment agencies are often transient, and sometimes invisible. In these 
hidden circuits, it is hard for workers to properly defend themselves against abuses,29 such 
as bad employment practices,30 or even criminal offences. Serious abuses can fall under the 
definition of the offence of human trafficking in Section 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code. In 

26 The sectors to which this report does not devote specific attention are still high-risk. Exploitation in criminal 
activity is discussed in Chapter 6 of this report.

its fifth report, the NRM therefore recommended that more attention should be devoted to 
facilitators, such as mala fide employment agencies, in the fight against human trafficking.

Research into these employment agencies largely focuses on labour brokering for workers 
from Central and Eastern European countries. The influx of these workers has contributed 
to the growth in the number of mala fide employment agencies since the accession of coun-
tries like Bulgaria, Romania and Poland to the European Union in 2004 and 2007. In addi-
tion to migrants from Central and Eastern Europe, there are also illegal aliens working in the 
Netherlands via mala fide employment agencies. Exclusionary policies with regard to illegal 
immigrants31 are said to make illegal aliens more dependent on gangmasters and mala fide 
employment agencies.32

In addition to the increase in the number of people looking for work, the growth in the 
number of these employment agencies is also due to the fact that no licence is required for 
employment agencies.33 As a result, more employment agencies have entered the market, in-
cluding those of more questionable legitimacy. The NRM pointed out previously that de-
regulation of the employment-agency sector would create a risk of exploitation.NRM5

Regulation or deregulation of the employment- agency sector
There have been various reactions to the abuses in the employment-agency sector from poli-
ticians, governments and a range of organisations and interest groups.34 The first steps to 
address these abuses have been taken by interest groups in the sector itself. For instance, a 
licensing system based on compliance with the NEN 4400 standard has been developed on 
the initiative of the Dutch Association of Temporary Work Agencies (ABU).35 To obtain a 
certificate, an employment agency is investigated on the basis of a number of criteria: the ob-
jective of the business must be to supply temporary workers, the business must keep proper 
personnel and salary records, and foreign workers must have a work permit. Companies that 
hire workers from certified employment agencies reduce their risk of recourse and penalties 
and also have a stronger case in the event of liability claims.36

In response to its own research, BNRM raised doubts about the self-regulatory capacity of 
the employment- agency sector in its fifth report. It has since emerged that the effectiveness 
of this enforcement strategy leaves a lot to be desired. First, the number of individuals being 
brokered by mala fide parties has not fallen since the introduction of certification, but in fact 

31 Engbersen et al. (2004, p. 6) cites the mandatory linking of a social insurance and tax number to a valid 
right of residence, the Compulsory Identification Act (1994), the Benefit Entitlement (Residence Status) Act 
(1998) and the Aliens Act (2000).

35 Employment agencies have been able to secure voluntary certification since 6 June 2006. The NEN 4400 

standard was definitively introduced on 1 January 2007. More than 1,600 employment agencies were certi-
fied in June 2008. Source: Parliamentary Documents II 2007/08, 17 050, no. 358, p. 3.

rose from 80,000 in 2004 to 100,000 in 2006.37 Although the number of abuses at certified 
companies is lower than at non-certified businesses, the percentage is still relatively high.38 
This could be due to the absence of any actual sanctions. If abuses are discovered, a company 
can be suspended for 30 days; the suspension can be converted into a definitive deregistra-
tion if the abuses are not adequately remedied.39 This compliance regime does not, however, 
provide for any sanctions if a certified company does not adhere to the standards imposed. 
Another aspect is that subscribing to the NEN standard is voluntary for employment agen-
cies and companies that hire workers from them, which increases the risk that companies 
will avoid the standards that are designed to prevent abuses.
One of the recommendations made in the NRM’s fifth report was therefore to review 
whether a licensing requirement – analogous to the UK’s Gangmaster Licensing Act – would 
have an effect in terms of preventing exploitative practices in the employment-agency sec-
tor and whether similar legislation should be introduced in the Netherlands. The govern-
ment partially adopted this recommendation by launching an investigation into extending 
the scope of the BIBOB Act,40 since by requiring employment agencies to have a licence, the 
sector would fall within the scope of the BIBOB Act. This would be desirable for the sec-
tor primarily because it would provide possibilities for combating criminal activities that 
municipalities come across in enforcing public order. However, extending the scope of the 
BIBOB Act to include the employment-agency sector does not mesh with the objectives of 
the BIBOB Act, since there is no question of government facilitation of criminal activity in 
that sector. For this reason, it was concluded that extending the licensing requirement to the 
employment-agency sector – and thus bringing it within the scope of the BIBOB Act – would 
not be desirable.
The Minister of Social Affairs and Employment also stated that a licensing requirement 
could not be enforced within the employment-agency system until such time as a clear dis-
tinction can be made between businesses that have an allocation function in the market 
and those that second personnel.41 The minister also regarded the introduction of the NEN 
standard as a success because of the growing number of certified employment agencies. The 
Labour Inspectorate can now carry out inspections more efficiently by only checking the 
certified employment agencies if there is cause to do so.42

41 The broad applicability of Article 7:690 of the Dutch Civil Code means that companies for whom the alloca-

tion function is not the main priority can depart from general labour law, to the detriment of the worker, on 
the basis of Article 7:691 of the Dutch Civil Code. No amendment of Article 7:690 of the Dutch Civil Code 
is related to the question of whether employment agencies have to register.

The minister is not adverse to the ABU’s proposal43 to make companies that hire workers 
from uncertified employment agencies jointly and severally liable for payment of the wages 
(at the level prescribed under the Minimum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act) 
and to provide for this in civil law.44 A legislative proposal has now been prepared to amend 
Article 7:692 of the Dutch Civil Code in connection with the introduction of host-company 
liability for payment of the applicable minimum wage and the applicable minimum holiday 
allowance.45 There are, however, a number of reservations to be expressed with regard to the 
government’s suggestion that this question should be regulated under civil law.
The first point is that the proposal only refers to ‘minimum wage’ and ‘minimum holiday 
allowance’; no reference is made to the wages agreed upon in collective labour agreements 
within a sector.
The Labour Inspectorate is also not given any enforcing role. The Central or Eastern Eu-
ropean agency workers must therefore personally compel payment of the minimum wage 
and minimum holiday allowance from the hiring company, but might refrain from doing so 
because of their vulnerable position as the result of their illegal status or dependency on the 
employer.
The Council of State46 has also ruled that it is uncertain whether the provision satisfies rel-
evant European Directives47. The first section of the proposed amendment of Article 7:692 
of the Dutch Civil Code would state that ‘the provision applies regardless of what law gov-
erns the employment contract and the contract between employer and third party’.48 Time 
will tell whether this new provision is compatible with European law and how it will work 
in practice.

Another recommendation in the fifth report touched on the interdepartmental approach to 
human trafficking, in which the contribution of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employ-
ment is particularly important. In 2008, the Social Intelligence and Investigation Service 
(SIOD) concluded a project in which ‘soft’ information was compiled from various sources 
to produce a list of the potentially worst employment agencies. The aim of this project was 
to discover information that could help in tackling employment agencies – by means of ad-
ministrative law or criminal law – that are involved in different forms of fraud in the labour 
market. The processing and analysis of data from hundreds of reports produced a list of 15 
businesses that might qualify for a criminal investigation by the SIOD. The analysis also 
yielded a list of 291 high-risk businesses, which was handed over to the Labour Inspectorate

and the tax authorities for the purpose of inspections. Attempts to tackle mala fide employ-
ment agencies have, in fact, been a priority in the SIOD’s investigative activities for years.49

One of the aims of the public prosecution service’s pilot project on other forms of exploita-
tion50 is to build up a crime projection analysis of other forms of exploitation in the employ-
ment-agency sector in the Drechtsteden region (Dordrecht, Papendrecht, etc.). It could also 
help to create a better overview of the situation and, by extension, improve efforts to tackle 
abuses in the sector.

12.3.2 Domestic work

The fifth report of the NRM identified domestic work as one of the highest-risk sectors for 
other forms of exploitation. Domestic work is hidden from view and can foster social iso-
lation and multiple dependence, especially for foreign workers who live in the employer’s 
home, making domestic workers particularly vulnerable to exploitation. In this section, a 
number of developments with regard to this high-risk sector are discussed, with special at-
tention to the category of domestic work for diplomats.
Various organisations actively campaign, nationally and internationally, to improve the posi-
tion of domestic workers.51 Informational material on the rights of domestic workers, aimed 
at this specific target group, is now also available in several languages in the Netherlands.52 
Some migrant organisations are very active in promoting the rights of those they represent. 
For instance, in 2006, after a campaign by the Philippine-based Commission for Filipino 
Migrant Workers (CFMW), the Abva Kabo trade union opened up membership to undocu-
mented domestic workers.53 Membership gives them access to legal assistance and free in-
struction in the Dutch language, among other things.54

Domestic work for diplomats
As indicated in the fifth report, the foreign domestic staff of diplomats face a heightened 
risk of being exploited.55 A recent report by the ILO also emphasised the vulnerability of this 

49 Annual Report of the SIOD, 2008, p. 12.
50 See §12.4.
51 For example, Anti Slavery International, Human Rights Watch, the International Labour Organisation 

(ILO), but also Dutch organisations such as Bonded Labour in the Netherlands (BLinN) and the Commis-
sion for Filipino Migrant Workers (CFMW).

52 BLinN developed informational material in several languages for this target group in 2008. FNV Bondgen-
oten also wrote a brochure entitled ‘Your rights as a domestic worker’.

group.56 Factors that make this group more vulnerable than other domestic workers is the 
fact that the employer’s diplomatic immunity can hamper efforts to combat abuses and the 
foreign employee’s right to stay in the Netherlands is not granted to the employee personally; 
it is based on the employer’s position.
One of the recommendations in the fifth report of the NRM was that the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs should develop a more proactive policy with regard to the terms and conditions un-
der which international diplomats in the Netherlands can employ foreign domestic workers. 
Another recommendation was that these domestic staff should be informed of their rights 
(under labour law) and should have the possibility of reporting abuses in their labour situa-
tion to the ministry, which will refer them on if necessary.
At the beginning of 2009, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs relaxated the policy towards the 
domestic staff of diplomats, agreeing, among other things, that domestic workers who wish 
to enter the employment of another privileged party would no longer have to return to the 
country of origin to apply for a temporary residence permit. In another change to the policy, 
Dutch missions abroad are instructed to interview domestic workers and explain their legal 
position in the Netherlands when they are issuing a diplomatic visa. The domestic workers 
have to be informed about their right to the prevailing minimum wage in the Netherlands, 
the number of vacation days they are entitled to, their rights in the event of illness or preg-
nancy, the fact that the employer does not have the right to confiscate the worker’s passport, 
and the employer’s obligation to reimburse the costs of the return journey to the country 
of origin upon termination of the employment contract (the employer may not make the 
employee work for these costs). The domestic workers are also informed of the possibility of 
informing the embassy of their own country or the ministry if the employer fails to comply 
with these legal and contractual obligations. The Dutch embassies abroad are also instruct-
ed to inform domestic workers that they can report abuse or human trafficking to the police. 
For the time being, these instructions are given to the household workers verbally; there are 
as yet no instructions to provide written information – including telephone numbers for the 
social services, the police and the ministry of foreign affairs, for example. The instructions 
do not apply for domestic staff of Dutch diplomats abroad.
In the spring of 2009 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to all embassies and in-
ternational organisations located in the Netherlands, informing them of the new policy and 
reminding employers of their obligations towards their personnel under labour law.57

56 ILO, Decent work for domestic workers, International Labour Conference, 99th Session 2010, Report IV 
(1).

57 The letter says, among other things, that the employer is not permitted to make the domestic worker work 
more hours per week than contractually agreed, to withhold the costs of the return ticket from the worker’s 
salary, or to hold onto the worker’s passport. One of the recommendations in the fifth report was that pri-
vate individuals who hire someone for household work should be informed about the minimum standards 
under labour law and human trafficking for other forms of exploitation (NRM5, 2007, recommendation 34). 
The letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs satisfied the first part of this recommendation. However, the 
letter does not contain any information about human trafficking for other forms of exploitation.

Exploitation of a domestic worker
H worked as a domestic worker for an embassy in the Netherlands on the basis of a privileged 
document. It was agreed in her employment contract that she would work 40 hours a week and 
receive a monthly salary of €1,400. However, according to H, she actually worked 15 hours a 
day, seven days a week, and only received €200 a month in salary. Her employer also took her 
passport. H wanted to be transferred to another employer. A friend put her in contact with an 
NGO that helped her. The NGO contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then con-
tacted H’s employer, who denied H’s allegations.
H went to the aliens police for an intake interview. She was not informed of her rights under 
the B9 regulation or offered a reflection period. H was not at all confident about how her case 
would be handled and decided to return to her country of origin. The public prosecution serv-
ice did not launch a prosecution.
The lawyer submitted a claim for back wages against the employer. Since the payments that H 
did receive were in cash, it was difficult for her to prove that she still owed wages.
The outcome of the proceedings was not known at the time this report was written.

In this case, the domestic worker was able to escape from the situation with the help of a 
friend and an NGO. However, since this sector cannot be monitored (because the work takes 
place in the home) and since foreign domestic workers no longer have any contact with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs or other authorities once they are in the Netherlands, situations 
can arise in which a domestic worker has no contact at all with the outside world and there-
fore cannot escape a situation of exploitation or other abuse. Reaching this group continues 
to be an area of concern.58

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs receives sporadic reports of abuses within the employment 
relationship between diplomats and domestic workers. When it receives such a report, the 
ministry faces a dilemma. Initially, the ministry can do nothing more than ask the privileged 
employer to comment on the reported abuses. As a rule, the ministry will only be prepared 
to exert diplomatic pressure if the accusations are supported by other indications that can 
corroborate the worker’s story. A decision to exert diplomatic pressure, however, is always 
taken in light of relations with the diplomat’s state, explicitly including consideration of 
whether such pressure might have undesirable consequences for the employees of the Dutch 
embassy in the country in question.
Diplomatic immunity further complicates matters. Nonetheless, a criminal prosecution can 
be brought despite the immunity, although a sentence cannot be enforced because of the im-
munity. The advantage of prosecuting the diplomat is that the foreign domestic worker can 
claim his or her rights under the B9 and B16 regulations.

58 The fifth report also recommends conducting an investigation into how the government can inform vulner-
able aliens living legally in the Netherlands (including the domestic staff of diplomats) about their legal posi-
tion and how they can be given the opportunity to ask questions or report abuses in relation to labour. See 
NRM5, 2007, recommendation 32.

12.3.3 Agriculture and horticulture

Stemming from an international seminar that it organised in April 2009 on exploitation in 
the agriculture and horticulture sector,59 the OSCE published a report distilling the inter-
national legal framework of exploitation in the agriculture sector, explaining the phenom-
enon of exploitation in agriculture and horticulture and identifying good practices and the 
challenges facing relevant organisations.60 The OSCE cites the nature and conditions of the 
work (the fact that the work is seasonal, physically taxing, dangerous and low-paid, for exam-
ple) as causes of exploitation in this sector by preventing workers from standing up for their 
rights61. The OSCE also mentions four trends in the agriculture sector that influence the vul-
nerability of workers: globalisation, immigration, employment agencies and gangmasters, 
and the temporary nature of the employment.
The OSCE’s findings and the trends it identified are to some extent consistent with an earlier 
study carried out by BNRM into other forms of exploitation in the Netherlands.NRM5 That 
study revealed the agriculture sector as a possible high-risk sector for human trafficking. Ex-
ploitation in the agriculture sector is also connected with the high-risk employment agency 
sector and the high-risk group of workers from Central and Eastern European countries.62 
Many illegal immigrants have, in fact, traditionally worked in the Dutch agriculture and hor-
ticulture sector.63

The principal cause of exploitation in Dutch agriculture and horticulture arises from the 
pressure to save on labour costs, which leads to a deterioration in the working conditions 
of the employees. The introduction of the Placement of Personnel by Intermediaries Act 
(WAADI)64 caused explosive growth in the employment-agency sector; the number of em-
ployment agencies providing seasonal labour in the Westland greenhouse agriculture and 
horticulture sector rose from a few dozen to approximately 1,600.65

A few initiatives
There have been various initiatives to prevent or combat abuses in the agriculture sector. In-
terest groups discuss labour practices and the rights of employees and employers with trade 
unions and employers’ organisations. The agriculture sector’s employers’ organisation (LTO 
Nederland) has developed the ‘Labour and good employment practices’ programme, the aim 
of which is to encourage its members to meet their staffing requirements in a socially respon-
sible manner. At the beginning of 2002, LTO Nederland and the Dutch Implementing Agency

for Employee Insurance (UWV) started the Seasonal Labour project, with the aim of helping 
employers to fill temporary job vacancies and to curb the use of illegal labourers.66

Other initiatives designed to address mala fide employment agencies are closely connected 
with exploitation in the agriculture sector; see §12.5.1. The Handmatige Agrarische Loonbed-
rijven (HAL) project is intended to reduce illegal employment in agriculture and horticulture 
by certifying so-called HAL companies, which are contractors that supply manual labourers 
for the sector. Certified companies are now included in the register of the Labour Standards 
Association (SNA).67

Dutch trade unions also fight exploitation in agriculture and horticulture. FNV Bondgenoten 
started the ‘equal work, equal pay’ campaign in 2006 to ensure that foreign workers do not 
work under less favourable working conditions than their Dutch counterparts.68

The Labour Inspectorate has made agreements with trade unions on investigating exploita-
tion in the agriculture sector. These agreements provide that the Inspectorate will start in-
vestigations in response to reports of evasion of the statutory provisions relating to the mini-
mum wage and working hours,69 which was what happened in the 82 Champi case, in which 
Polish labourers were working 15 hours a day, seven days a week, for a mushroom grower.70

The Labour Inspectorate does not investigate the housing situation of workers. If the Labour 
Inspectorate discovers evidence of poor housing, it reports it to the UWV if a work permit 
has been granted,71 or to the relevant municipality or the Housing Inspectorate.72

The preventive, supervisory, administrative and criminal-law instruments described above 
are used to prevent or investigate individual abuses in agriculture and horticulture. However, 
exploitation often involves an accumulation of abuses, such as low pay, poor housing and 
a relationship of dependency. Because of this, situations of exploitation might not be per-
ceived as human trafficking, since each violation in a company is dealt with individually – and 
not in combination with other abuses – by the relevant authority. A striking example of this 
seems to have occurred at a farm in Someren, a town in Brabant, where workers were poorly 
housed and worked extremely long days for exceptionally low pay.73 The employer might also 
have used coercion. Taken together, the abuses could indicate human trafficking.74 For a long

time, however, the abuses in Someren were addressed individually by the police and vari-
ous inspectorates.75 The Minister of Social Affairs and Employment has promised76 to in-

12.3.4 Exploitation in marriage

The fifth report of the NRM stated that marriage can also play a role in human trafficking. 
In the study of case law in §12.6, there is a discussion of a decision in which, according to the 
charges, exploitation took place within a marriage.77 ‘Brides’ in marriages that are not based 
on consensus constitute a high-risk group for human trafficking. A marriage that the bride 
and groom initially enter into consensually can later result in a situation of exploitation, if 
it emerges in retrospect that the groom or his family wants to use the bride as a ‘domestic 
slave’, for example. The consent or otherwise to the choice of partner varies in forced mar-
riages. There are also different manifestations of forced marriages, one of the most common 
being the marriage arranged by family members.78 With any form of forced marriage, treat-
ing it as a family matter does not do sufficient justice to the phenomenon. Outside of the re-
lational context in which the marriage takes place, a forced marriage is defined as a religious 
or legal marriage in which the preparatory acts of marriage have taken place against the free 
will of at least one of the marriage candidates and to which consent has been given under a 
certain kind of force.79

Nothing is known about how widespread forced marriages are, since the relevant authorities 
do not keep records of it. It is also uncharted territory for many Dutch professionals. A pos-
sible reason for this is that forced marriages are frequently entered into abroad. Women or 
men who become the victim of exploitation in a marriage are extremely vulnerable because 
the exploitation occurs within the domestic sphere – concealed from the outside world. The 
fact that victims of exploitation in marriage usually come from abroad and therefore do not 
speak the language well or know how to approach agencies also makes this group particu-
larly vulnerable to exploitation.

International legislation contains explicit prohibitions against forced marriages, but they do 
not refer to human trafficking.80 The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slav-

ery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery,81 to which the Nether-
lands is party, does cite forced marriage as a practice similar to slavery.82

A forced marriage can possess characteristics of slave trading and slavery, in that the victim 
is traded or is under the control of or is the ‘property’ of another person. Reasoning by anal-
ogy with the Supplementary Convention, the forced marriage could qualify as a form of 
exploitation falling within the scope of Article 273f (1) (1) of the Dutch Criminal Code, as 
long as the other criteria for the application of that provision are satisfied.
As mentioned above, nothing is known about the scale of exploitation within marriage in the 
Netherlands. In the ‘Imported bride’ case discussed in §12.6.2, the bride managed to escape 
from her situation after attending an assimilation course and seeing a film about two women 
who had been mistreated and locked up for years.83 Devoting attention to the phenomenon 
in assimilation courses could perhaps be a good way of reaching at least some of the poten-
tial target group and prompting discussion of forced marriages and the possibility of exploi-
tation within a marriage.

12.4 Dutch case law on other forms of exploitation, 2005-2009 

The fifth report of the NRM devoted a lot of attention to exploitation in sectors other than 
the sex industry (other forms of exploitation) and the criminalisation of human trafficking 
with a view to such exploitation. The report noted that the lack of a clear definition of what 
‘exploitation’ involves in this context makes it difficult to identify, investigate and prosecute 
this form of human trafficking. The legislature chose to leave the further interpretation of 
‘exploitation’ and the scope of the description of the offence to the legal practice. How the 
legal practice performs this task of establishing the law has far-reaching implications for the 
investigation and prosecution of other forms of exploitation. To gain a better insight into 
the development of case law and the bottlenecks concerning other forms of exploitation, 
BNRM analysed the available case law on other forms of exploitation from the time Article 
273 (a) to (f) of the Dutch Criminal Code took effect until the time this report was written84. 
Because of the importance of the formulation of the law, all the judgments were examined 
very closely, and it was decided to describe each case in detail in this report.

In §12.6.1, the most important features of the analysed judgments and the problems they 
highlight are discussed. In the following section, all the judgments are discussed in chrono-

81 Geneva, 7 September 1956.
82 Considered comparable to slavery are: (c) Any institution or practice whereby: (i) A woman, without the 

right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her 
parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his 
clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or (iii) A woman on the 
death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

known.

logical order. The discussion concludes with a comparison with the jurisprudence in other 
countries (§12.6.3).

12.4.1 An outline of the case law

The prosecution of other forms of exploitation was slow to take off after 1 January 2005. 
The case law is therefore limited. At the time of writing, 12 cases had been dealt with in first 
instance85 (seven of which are known to have been appealed). In one case, the appeal court 
had made a decision, which was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has 
not yet pronounced judgment in the case. It is therefore still too early to draw any definitive 
conclusions from the case law; however, a number of trends and issues are emerging from 
the case law and are discussed in the sections below.
The judgments indicate that neither producing convincing evidence nor weighing the facts 
and circumstances in cases concerning other forms of exploitation is straightforward. The 
early prosecutions failed mainly on the charge of exploitation or intention of exploitation, 
which is not surprising, since it is precisely this element of the offence that has to be fleshed 
out by means of judicial interpretation. It is on this point, accordingly, that the case law shows 
interesting differences of interpretation. There are also interesting aspects to the question 
of whether there was coercion in the form of abusing a vulnerable position. One point that 
needs to be addressed, for example, is how much weight the judge should attach to the fact 
that the initiative for the employment did or did not come from the suspect and/or that the 
person put to work agreed to the terms and conditions of the employment.86

Another question is whether the worker had any reasonable alternative to ending up in a 
situation of exploitation or whether it could have been avoided. The case law is still evolving 
on this point. The following analysis of the judgments attempts to answer these questions in 
light of the treaties underlying Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code, since the treaties signed by 
the Netherlands and European legislation should also guide the further interpretation and 
delineation of the prohibition on human trafficking outside the sex industry.NRM5

Definition of the offence87

As regards other forms of exploitation, Article 273f (1) (1) of the Dutch Criminal Code is 
based on the definition of human trafficking in Article 3(a) of the UN Palermo Protocol88 
and Article 1(1) of the EU Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings.89 

85 Here a ‘case’ refers to an investigation that has been dealt with by the courts. Eight of the 12 cases involved 
more than one suspect. 

86 In this respect, compare The Hague District Court, 21 November 2007, LJN: AZ2707 (Fleurtop) and The 
Hague District Court, 14 December 2007, LJN: BC1195 (Mehak) on the one hand, and the Den Bosch Court 
of Appeal, 30 January 2008, LJN: BC3000 (Chinese restaurant) on the other. In Zwolle District Court, 29 
April 2008, LJN: BD0846, the judge seems to have followed a middle course.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

496

It is a criminal offence to recruit, transport, move, accommodate or shelter another person 
by force, violence or other act, with the intention of exploiting that other person. This defi-
nition of the offence, which, incidentally, does not require the other person to be actually 
exploited, refers to coercion in the broad sense. In addition to force, violence and the threat 
of violence, the provision also refers to an ‘other act’ or ‘threat of other act’, extortion, fraud, 
deception or the abuse of authority arising from the actual state of affairs, the abuse of a 
vulnerable position and giving or receiving remuneration or benefits in order to obtain the 
consent of a person who has authority over that other person.90 Insofar as these means ap-
peared in Article 250ter and Article 250a of the old Dutch Criminal Code, there have been 
court decisions that further define them.91

If a suspect is charged under Article 273f (1) (1), the judge assesses the evidence presented 
against the three elements of the description of the offence (act, means, intention). The pub-
lic prosecution service has no particular difficulty proving recruitment, transport, moving, 
accommodation or sheltering of another person (the acts). In the judgments studied, the 
judicial finding that a case had not been proved most often rested on the assessment of the 
means of coercion (abuse of a vulnerable position) and the element of exploitation.

Abuse of a vulnerable position
The line taken in the case law on the means of coercion is that the combination of illegal resi-
dence, a poor economic position and inability to speak Dutch create a vulnerable position. 
Even illegal residence on its own creates a vulnerable position.92 In some decisions it was as-
sumed that if the suspect was aware that the other person was in this vulnerable position and 
took advantage of that position to derive some benefit (by acquiring cheap labour), it was a 
case of abuse of a vulnerable position.93

However, in the ‘Chinese restaurant’ case, the Court of Appeal in Den Bosch cited an ad-
ditional requirement for a judicial finding that there was ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’ by 
ruling that a certain initiative and positive act by the perpetrator(s) is presumed, by which 
they consciously abuse the weaker or vulnerable position of victims.94 The court of appeal’s 

90 In view of the intention of the international instruments on which the enumeration of the means is based, 
terms such as force, fraud and extortion must be interpreted broadly and in a technical sense, and not strictly 
according to the relevant definitions of the offence (Cleiren and Nijboer, 2008).

91 The Supreme Court ruled that there was no coercion if the victim did not notice the coercion or perceive 
it as such and, conversely, that it is sufficient that the means of coercion frightens or intimidates the vic-
tim, even if it would not generally have made an impression on others (Supreme Court, 13 June 1995, DD 
1995, 387 and Supreme Court, 28 May 1996, DD 1996, 321, respectively). For more examples, see Lestrade 
(2008).

92 The Court of Appeal is Den Bosch ruled that aliens who had been hired were in a vulnerable position “sim-
ply because they were staying in the Netherlands illegally” (Den Bosch Court of Appeal, 30 January 2008, 
LJN: BC2999). Zwolle District Court adopted a similar formulation in the Moonfish case (Zwolle Court, 29 
April 2008, LJN: BD0860).

93 For example, see The Hague District Court, 21 November 2006, LJN: AZ2707 (Fleurtop) and The Hague 
District Court, 5 October 2007, LJN: BB5303 (Dwergarend).

judgment in this case is not yet final.95 The criterion applied by the court of appeal has been 
adopted by other judges in later cases involving other forms of exploitation.96 On this means 
of coercion, Cleiren and Nijboer write: “The legislative history provides no further explana-
tion of abuse of a vulnerable position. According to Remmelink, it may arise if one person 
encounters the other person in such a position without there being any relationship between 
the two, while abuse of authority pertains more to inequality where there is a relationship.97 
It is precisely in the case of subtle coercion, such as the abuse of a vulnerable position, that 
the abuse is often concealed in more passive acts, for example, where a suspect agrees to a 
request by an alien, who is residing illegally in the Netherlands and has no money or shelter, 
to be allowed to perform work for him or her in exchange for a low wage. As the court ruled 
in the Fleurtop case, the suspect abuses the vulnerable position if he or she is aware of that 
position and takes advantage of that position to derive some benefit. To decide whether this 
constitutes human trafficking, it then has to be decided whether there was exploitation or 
the intention of exploitation. In the case law examined, however, the court regularly found 
that this form of coercion had not been proved, which meant that the court did not proceed 
to consider the question of whether exploitation had taken place.
In each of the three cases that resulted in a conviction for other forms of exploitation, a more 
severe means of coercion was used, such as force or violence. Obviously, the coercion was 
clearly evident in these cases. However, the less evident means of coercion, such as misuse of 
a vulnerable position, were included in the text of the legislation for a reason. It is precisely 
these subtle forms of coercion that are used in other forms of exploitation.

Exploitation
The second subsection of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code enumerates what, at least, the 
term exploitation encompasses. In addition to sexual exploitation, it includes forced or com-
pulsory labour or services, slavery and practices similar to slavery or servitude. The legisla-
ture explained that these forms of modern slavery could include forcing someone to work 
under coercion or the abuse of a dependent position of a person who, under the given circum-
stances, did not reasonably have any other choice but to to end up in a situation of exploita-
tion, citing as an example an extremely long working week for disproportionately low pay in 
poor working conditions.98 Not every abuse in relation to work constitutes exploitation.NRM5 
In the case of exploitation as the intended outcome of human trafficking, fundamental rights 
such as human dignity, personal freedom or physical integrity are at stake.99

The judgments that have been rendered to date confirm that Article 273f only pertains to 
excessive abuse in relation to work. It is noteworthy that two of the three cases in which 

95 The judgment of the Supreme Court is expected on 24 November 2009.

Court, 10 April 2009, LJN: BI0944 (Garage owner). This argument was even adopted in several cases of 
sexual exploitation. On this point, see §11.4.1 (escorting Brazilian women).

suspects were convicted of other forms of exploitation involved personal services and the 
performance of domestic work in the home of the suspect(s), accompanied by, among other 
things, physical violence and such intensive contact between suspects and victims that the 
latter had little or no personal privacy.100 The third case that led to a conviction for other 
forms of exploitation101 also involved very close contact between victim and suspect, as well 
as an extraordinary amount of physical violence against the victim. Seven of the nine cases 
that resulted in acquittals, on the other hand, involved commercial employment where the 
interaction between the workers and the suspects was less evidently stifling and overwhelm-
ing because, for example, it was not a one-on-one relationship or because they did not live in 
the same house. It is possible that the work place (in the house or at a business location that 
is part of the formal economy) and the degree to which the relationship between the suspect 
and victim is a commercial one influence the court’s opinion on where the dividing line be-
tween poor employment practices and exploitation lies. It is also possible that convincing ev-
idence of exploitation is easier to produce if the victim’s physical integrity has been violated 
by violence than, for example, by physically harmful work or an exhausting work regime.

Exploitation affects a person’s fundamental rights. In some judgments102 the courts explicitly 
considered whether there had been a violation of human rights, but only after first deciding 
whether there had been exploitation. However, exploitation is a violation of human rights, 
so that question should no longer need to be answered if, in the court’s view, exploitation 
within the meaning of Article 273f has already been proved.

In two rulings, it was found with regard to the ‘intention of exploiting’ (as an element of the 
offence) that this intention was not present since the actions were not exclusively, or in these 
cases primarily, focused on exploitation.103 However, the law does not require the intention 
to be focused exclusively on exploitation. With abusive actions in combination with coercive 
measures, the suspect might have other goals in addition to exploitation, without this neces-
sarily standing in the way of a conviction under Section 273f (1) (1) Dutch Criminal Code.

The fifth report of the NRM stated that a situation constitutes exploitation if there is co-
ercion, poor terms of employment or working conditions or multiple dependency and the 
victim does not have or reasonably feels he or she does not have the freedom to escape from 
the work situation. It should be noted here that this condition is also satisfied if withdrawal 
from the situation is possible in practical terms, but the victim’s subjective appraisal forms 
an obstacle to doing so. This subjective perception of a lack of freedom caused particular 
difficulty in a number of rulings (“The bar was set too high”). In a number of judgments, 

100 Utrecht District Court cites the victim’s statement that “the suspect totally lived his life for him” (Utrecht 
District Court, 17 June 2008, LJN: BD7426).

the court found that it could not be established that the workers had no reasonable choice 
other than to work for the suspect(s), or that they had been free to leave.104 The question 
then is what realistic alternative did the workers have? On the other hand, in a number of 
other cases it was in fact assumed that the workers did not have the freedom to escape the 
situation even though their freedom was not physically impaired.105 In the Dwergarend case, 
the court found it plausible that it would have been difficult for the female workers to stop 
working, since they would no longer have any income or shelter. Nevertheless, a number 
of them independently returned to Poland or started working for themselves as domestic 
workers in the Netherlands. Despite the fact that there was evidently a realistic and demon-
strated alternative for a number of the women, this did not prevent the court from finding 
that there was coercion in the form of misuse of a vulnerable position. In the Mehak case, the 
court gave an apt interpretation when it said that it could see a certain ‘inconsistency’, since 
the victims came to work in the Netherlands voluntarily and were grateful that the suspects 
enabled them to do so. However, that does not alter the actual impossibility, having arrived 
in the Netherlands, of escaping from a hopeless situation under degrading conditions, which 
the court felt could be characterised as a situation of servitude as referred to in Article 273f 
(2) Dutch Criminal Code.

Nature of the work
In three judgments, the activities carried out by the worker or victim in the situation of ex-
ploitation were criminal offences. In the two rulings that resulted in acquittal for human 
trafficking,106 the court did mention the criminal nature of the work in reaching the conclu-
sion that there had been no exploitation, but it is not apparent from the judgment that the 
court attached any weight to the fact that the work that the workers had to perform consti-
tuted a crime. The fact that the low pay and long working hours could not be characterised 
as extreme should, however, be considered in connection with the fact that the work itself 
was a criminal offence.

According to the charges, in six of the 12 cases studied, sexual services had also been per-
formed by the workers/victims. In the Chinese massage parlours case107 the masseuses, ac-
cording to the charges, had to perform both massages and sexual acts with customers. From 
a perusal of the charges, however, it seems that the public prosecutor overlooked the fact 
that performing sexual acts with a third party for remuneration constitutes prostitution and 
that if any one of the means of coercion is used to persuade the victim to engage in sexual 

104 Similar arguments were put forward by the court in the Chinese restaurant, Van stekkie tot stickie, Moon-
fish, Abuse by social worker, Garage owner and Chinese massage parlours cases. 

105 This was the situation in the Fleurtop (The Hague District Court Haag, 21 November 2006, LJN: AZ2707), 
Mehak (The Hague District Court, 14 December 2007, LJN: BC1761) and Mentally Impaired Person (Utrecht 
District Court, 17 June 2008, LJN: BD7426) cases.

acts, the situation has to be regarded as forced prostitution, and therefore as human traffick-
ing. In this case, in addition to the exploitation in the massage parlours cited in the charges 
(other form of exploitation), the suspects could reasonably also have been charged with ex-
ploitation in the prostitution sector. The court subsequently acquitted the suspects on all the 
charges relating to human trafficking offences.

In five other cases108 there were also sexual acts, but they were not commercial in nature. In 
these five cases, the workers/victims were said to have been sexually abused by the suspects 
themselves. The court found that the sexual abuse had been proved in two of the cases,109 
which raises the question of whether sexual exploitation by a single person, outside the sex 
industry, can fall within the scope of Article 273f. An NGO put this question to BNRM some 
time ago in relation to the case described below.

Sexual exploitation outside the sex industry
J was living illegally in the Netherlands and came into contact with an older, single Dutch man. 
He offered her domestic work in his home. J could earn a small amount and would also receive 
room and board.
J moved in with the man. It turned out that the man wanted to have sex with her. She saw no 
possibility of refusing his advances and at first accepted that this was part of the deal. The 
man demanded a great deal of sex, however, and rarely let her go (literally). Sometimes, when 
things became too much for the client, she could go out for a walk. She could have run away, 
but stayed because of the promises the man made. He promised to marry her and secure a 
residence permit for her. He said he was already arranging it with the municipality. J saw this 
as her only possibility of obtaining legal residence in the Netherlands. She assumed the man 
would keep his promise.

There are parallels between this case and a case in Leeuwarden, in which a social worker took 
a client into his home and persuaded her not only to perform domestic work, but also to have 
sex with him.110 It could be argued that in the case described above, the suspect provided the 
woman with accommodation/shelter, using coercion in the form of deception (the woman 
was told she would get a residence permit if she married the man) and/or abuse of authority 
arising from the actual state of affairs and/or abuse of a vulnerable position (J was living in 
the Netherlands illegally and feared to get arrested and the man took advantage of that). The 
question then arises of whether there was the intention of exploiting the woman. Section 
273f (2) Dutch Criminal Code also cites ‘other forms of sexual exploitation’ as a form of ex-
ploitation. It does not say that third parties must be involved, as is the case with exploitation 
in prostitution. Given the intention of international instruments such as the Palermo Proto-
col, on which Section 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code is based, there is also no reason to 
interpret the term ‘other forms of sexual exploitation’ restrictively. Moreover, if a person is

smuggling cases. All of these cases are discussed at length in the next section.

indeed guilty of human trafficking if he or she persuades another person to perform domes-
tic work by taking advantage of the other person’s vulnerable position, why would it be any 
different if that vulnerable position is exploited to obtain sexual favours?
The question that has to be answered is, when is there a case of ‘other forms of sexual exploita-
tion’? After all, a person’s physical integrity is, by definition, affected by this form of exploita-
tion, in contrast to exploitation in the labour relationship. Is the mere fact that someone must 
have sex with another person in a situation where the victim’s vulnerable position is exploited 
sufficient to establish human trafficking? Can there already be a case of ‘other forms of sexual 
exploitation’ if the ‘victim’ had sex with the suspect once (as a result of the use of coercion)? 
Does this form of exploitation fall somewhere between forced prostitution and forced labour 
or services, or rape? And when do the sexual acts become rape and under what circumstances 
can they fall within the scope of human trafficking? Can it be argued that in the case of more 
evident forms of coercion (such as violence or the threat of violence), it is rape, while more 
subtle forms of coercion (such as abuse of a vulnerable position), point more in the direction 
of human trafficking? The courts have not yet ruled on these questions.

Charges
In most cases, charges were brought under various sections of Article 273f Dutch Criminal 
Code; the combination of section 1, subsections 1 and 4, was frequently charged. What is 
striking is that in a few cases charges were only brought in connection with section 1, sub-
section 1.111 It is not clear why subsection 4 was not included in the charges in these cases. 
Sometimes the elements were confused in the elaboration of the facts in the charges. For in-
stance, indicators of exploitation were sometimes mentioned when means of coercion were 
meant,112 and vice versa, facts were sometimes presented under the heading of exploitation, 
when they were elements of the means.113

Appeal and cassation
Because the task of formulating the law has been left to the courts, it is important for more 
rulings to be rendered in cases of other forms of exploitation. It is also important for appeal 
courts, and of course the Supreme Court, to rule on these matters. In seven of the 12 cases 
examined, the decision in first instance was appealed. At the time of writing, a judgement 
on appeal had only been rendered in the ‘Chinese restaurant’ case. The five cases in which 

111 These are the Chinese restaurant and Mehak cases, see §12.6.2.
112 The indictment in Den Bosch District Court, 8 March 2007, LJN: BA0145 (Chinese restaurant), stated, for 

example: “[…] this coercion, fact, deception and/or abuse consisted of the fact that he, the suspect, allowed 
said persons, all of whom were living in the Netherlands illegally, for (on average) six days a week, (roughly) 
eleven hours a day in the [name of restaurant] restaurant (of which the suspect was one of the managers) 
in exchange for food and lodging, or a very small monetary remuneration and/or housed them with other 
persons in a (small) room in the building in which the [name of restaurant] restaurant is established and/
or prevented them from leaving the building, or seeking contact with the outside world.” The indicators of 
exploitation are mentioned in the arguments supporting the finding that there was coercion.

no appeal had been filed114 were all cases that ended in acquittal on the human trafficking 
charges.

General characteristics
Almost every case of other forms of exploitation that has been tried involved events in sec-
tors that were referred to earlier as high-risk sectors:NRM5 crime (cannabis growing and drug 
smuggling), the Chinese catering sector, personal services and domestic work, cleaning and 
factory work in the food industry. In one case, the events took place in the craft metal-work-
ing sector. Nine of the 12 cases involved labour performed by migrants, some of whom had 
only recently arrived in the country. In total, 35 suspects were tried in the 12 cases, and in all 
of the cases, other charges were brought in addition to human trafficking, such as violations 
of the Opium Act, participation in a criminal organisation, human smuggling, illegal weapon 
possession, abuse by a social worker, complicity in assault leading to death, complicity in as-
sault, influencing witnesses, rape and offences against tax law. Although only four suspects 
– in three cases – were found guilty of human trafficking, 23 of the 31 suspects acquitted of 
human trafficking were convicted of one or more of the other offences they were charged 
with. Two cases resulted in a full acquittal.
The four suspects convicted in the three cases were given average prison sentences of 33 
months;115 one was also sentenced to community service. In two rulings, the court also or-
dered the convicted persons to pay compensation for emotional injury as demanded by the 
victim (€500 and €1,500, respectively).116

Finally, in four cases, the victims/workers were involved in criminal offences that were close-
ly related to the situation of exploitation. In two of these cases, the victims were prosecuted 
for those offences.117

Cultural aspects
In almost all the cases, the suspects and the people who worked for them shared a cultur-
al background, in the sense that they belonged to the same or a related ethnic or linguistic 
group. In two cases, the relationship was closer still, with family ties between the victims 
and suspects.118 This seems to confirm in practice that in certain forms of ethnic entrepre-
neurship there is a heightened risk of exploitation and that exploitation also occurs within 
relationships and/or families.NRM5

114 These are the cases discussed at length in §12.6.2: Fleurtop, Van stekkie tot stickie, Polish cleaners (the public 
prosecution service lodged an appeal in this case, but later withdrew it), Imported bride and Garage owner.

115 It should be noted that three suspects were also found guilty of other serious offences, specifically rape and 
causing the smuggling of drugs (Forced drug smuggling case) and complicity in assault ( Mehak case)

Court, 22 April 2009, LJN: BI3519 (Forced drug smuggling).

Cultural aspects in trials for other forms of exploitation119

Following the ruling in the Mehak case,120 BNRM investigated whether cultural background also 
played a role in other cases of other forms of exploitation. In the Mehak case, the District Court in 
The Hague ruled that it was plausible in the relevant cultural setting that the victims were unable 
to have access to their own identity documents. The district court also took the victim’s cultural 
background into account as an extenuating circumstance. Quite apart from the decision in the 
Mehak case, there are other reasons for assuming that cultural background might have played a 
role in other cases of other forms of exploitation. First, there is overlap between the countries of 
origin of the suspects and victims.121 Second, culture can be seen as one of the factors that makes a 
person vulnerable to exploitation. Belonging to a particular cultural minority group can result in 
discrimination, which might make it more difficult to find employment. Cultural values can also 
cause people to regard certain actions or conditions as acceptable. Certain cultural stereotypes 
can also influence preferences for certain migrants and a person’s possibilities of being hired in the 
country of destination. Third, the element of coercion in Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code can 
also depend on the subjective perception ( in other words, the cultural context) of the victim.122

All seven123 cases known to BNRM as of 1 November 2008 were examined to investigate the 
role of cultural background in cases of other forms of exploitation. The examination of the files 
showed that, with the exception of the appellant’s brief, the indicators of cultural background124 
can be found in most of the case documents studied,125 which suggests that all of the actors in 
the criminal trial referred to cultural background.126 The cultural background is brought into 
the case in various ways, such as when arguing against the severity of the sentence or in the 
discussion of personal circumstances. Cultural background also plays a role in the evidence. 
The inability of the individuals concerned to speak Dutch and their not being in possession of 
a passport as a result of the cultural setting led to a conclusion that they did not act voluntarily. 
However, it emerged from interviews with judges that they seem to be searching for a balance 
between taking cultural background into account and not doing so, but without much certainty 
about the latitude and the boundaries within which the cultural background can be taken into 
account. It can be concluded that the Mehak case seems to have been an exception, in the sense 
that cultural background was explicitly cited on several occasions in the judgment, although 
that does not necessarily mean that it played a role in the evidence of the specific means of co-
ercion. What was striking here was the fact that the charges on other forms of exploitation in 
this case were incidental.127 The manner in which culture played a role in the Mehak case does 
not seem to be out of step. Cultural background can be an important factor, both in relation to 
the evidence and the severity of the penalty.

12.4.2 Discussion of court decisions

This section discusses the 12 rulings concerning other forms of exploitation, in chronologi-
cal order.

Cannabis cultivation – Fleurtop
In the first case involving other forms of exploitation to come before the courts,128 the sus-
pects were acquitted of human trafficking. The facts as they emerged from the judgment are 
set out in the box below.

Case of cannabis cultivation – Fleurtop
The suspects regularly hired Bulgarian men, women and older children living illegally in the 
country to cut the tops of cannabis plants. The illegal activities took place in the evening and at 
night, and the workers were paid approximately €4.50 an hour. The Bulgarians usually received 
a telephone call shortly before they were to come to work, informing them when and where 
they were to wait to be picked up. The cutters were then transported to the cutting location in 
vans that were too cramped and were blacked out or in the sealed cargo area of a truck. The 
cutters usually had no idea where they were working. On arrival at the site, they had to turn off 
their mobile telephones. The working conditions were poor: seated on crates and in the stink 
of the plants they had to cut the tops off the cannabis plants. They were not allowed to leave the 
area they were working in. After completing the work, they were brought back to The Hague.

In its assessment of whether there was human trafficking in this case, the court found, with 
regard to the means, that the suspects had recruited Bulgarians who were residing illegally 
in the Netherlands, spoke hardly any Dutch and were in an economic position that could 
be described as outright poverty to perform criminal work (cutting cannabis plants) in the 
evenings and at night. The suspects unscrupulously took advantage of the Bulgarians’ des-
perate situation. Given the context in which the Bulgarians had to survive, the court rejected 
the defence’s position that they did the work gladly and voluntarily and that there was no 
question of coercion, since the cutters themselves turned up at the pick-up point and some 
of them knew what kind of work they would be doing. The court therefore ascertained that 
there was coercion through misuse of a vulnerable position and of authority by ruling: “The 
suspect and his accomplices induced the illegal cutters to make themselves available to per-
form work by abusing their vulnerable position and by abusing authority arising from the 
actual state of affairs.”129

The court then considered whether there was exploitation. For this to be the case, there would 
have to be a violation of fundamental rights. To evaluate whether that was the situation in 
this case, the court took into account the following circumstances: people in a vulnerable 
position were induced by the suspects to perform criminal activities for them; the work was

badly paid (about 25% below minimum wage without any social security) and performed in 
poor conditions. The transport to and from work totally failed to meet the standard for safe 
transport. Once they had stepped into the blacked-out van or cargo area of a truck, the peo-
ple were no longer able to withdraw from the work for which they had been recruited.
The court found these circumstances to be in violation of decent employment practices and 
accused the suspects of treating the workers without respect, but it did not arrive at the ver-
dict that there was exploitation, since the Bulgarians depended entirely on the suspects for 
the work, the cutters performed the work on an incidental basis and it had not been shown 
that the working hours were extremely long or the pay was extremely low; therefore, the sus-
pects did not violate the rights of the cutters to such an extent that exploitation as referred to 
in Section 273a/f Dutch Criminal Code could be established. The court said in the decision 
that it was a ‘close call’.
The court apparently did not attach any weight to the fact that the work that the labourers 
had to perform was a criminal offence. The fact that the poor pay and long working hours 
could not be described as extreme should be seen in conjunction with the fact that the work 
itself was punishable.
The decision is final and irrevocable.130

Chinese restaurant
The prosecution of a chef and sous-chef131 for the exploitation of illegal workers in a Chinese 
restaurant also resulted in an acquittal by the district court,132 and, later, the court of appeal 
in Den Bosch133, although the decisions were based on different considerations than those in 
the Fleurtop case.

Chinese restaurant case
This case concerned illegal Chinese aliens working in a Chinese restaurant. They worked on 
average of 11 to 13 hours a day, six days a week, for a monthly wage of €450 to €800. They slept 
a number of workers to a bedroom. The court of appeal found that the workers had them-
selves approached the restaurant for work and that they were free to leave at any time. It ruled 
that human trafficking had not been proved. The chef and sous-chef were convicted of people 
smuggling.134

suspect followed several months later: Den Bosch District Court, 28 July 2007, LJN: BD8599. This judg-
ment also produced an acquittal on human trafficking, but the suspect was convicted of a tax offence and of 
forgery. As far as BNRM is aware, no appeal has been filed.

506

The suspects were charged with human trafficking under Article 273f (1) (1) of the Dutch 
Criminal Code. It is noteworthy that Article 1 (4) was not included in the charges. Following 
the district court, the court of appeal ruled that the description of human trafficking in the 
UN Palermo Protocol, which Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code implements, relates prima-
rily to activities designed to achieve the ultimate aim of exploitation, while the former human 
trafficking provision (Article 250a Dutch Criminal Code) was primarily concerned with the 
exploitation per se. This distinction was indeed made in the explanatory memorandum, but 
the legislature also stated there that “human trafficking is (aimed at) exploitation”135. The ban 
on human trafficking therefore also encompassed exploitation: excessive abuse in a relation-
ship of work or service, as well as the acts designed to place a person in that kind of position. 
The fact that exploitation is the key term in the definition of the offence in Article 273f Dutch 
Criminal Code follows from, among other things, the legislative history, in which reference 
is made to various treaties, and the legislature’s intention to give priority to the preservation 
of physical and emotional integrity and the individual’s personal freedom in criminalising 
human trafficking.NRM5

The court of appeal first established whether acts were performed (recruiting, accommo-
dating or sheltering) involving the use of one of the means cited in section 1 of the article. 
In deciding whether coercion was used in the form of the misuse of a vulnerable position 
or of authority, the court of appeal first found: “The first thing that can be said is that the 
Chinese referred to in the charges were in a vulnerable/weaker position simply because they 
were living in the Netherlands illegally”.136 Since it had been established that they were in a 
vulnerable position, the court of appeal considered whether the suspects had abused that 
vulnerable position. In the court of appeal’s view, this presumed a certain initiative and posi-
tive action on the part of the perpetrator(s), whereby they consciously abused the weaker or 
vulnerable position of the victims. The court of appeal found that, although the workers in 
this case were in a vulnerable position simply because they were residing in the Netherlands 
illegally, the suspects had not taken the initiative or taken positive action towards them. They 
had only responded to requests, and sometimes entreaties, from the workers, who had them-
selves decided to migrate, were in the country to earn money, did not owe any debts to the 
suspects and were free to leave the restaurant. Under those circumstances, according to the 
court of appeal, it had not been proved that the suspects had intentionally misused the work-
ers’ vulnerable position by giving them shelter and accommodation. The court also found 
that persons who only asked for room and board in exchange for work performed their un-
paid or seriously underpaid work voluntarily. With this opinion, the court of appeal disre-
garded the fact that the suspects were aware of the vulnerable position of the workers – as 
indicated by the entreaties – and availed of this vulnerable position to hire extremely cheap 
labour. This can be characterised as the means of coercion (abusing a vulnerable position)

that, if it is established, makes the victim’s consent irrelevant.137 It is not clear why this should 
be different where the contact or initiative comes from the victim.

Although the court of appeal did not have to decide whether exploitation took place at the 
restaurant, it decided that it had not. Although the situation was socially undesirable, with 
the workers sharing bedrooms above the restaurant, working days of 11 to 13 hours, with only 
five days off each month and a monthly salary of €450 to €800,138 it had not been shown that 
the working conditions per se were bad, and the workers were able to freely dispose of their 
income. Moreover, the court of appeal found, it could not be said of the Chinese that they 
did not have any reasonable choice but to reside and work in the restaurant. What realistic 
alternative the Chinese illegal aliens might have had remains the question.
The public prosecution service appealed to the Supreme Court in this case.139

“Van stekkie tot stickie” case
The third case in the Netherlands involving prosecution for human trafficking in the sense of 
other forms of exploitation also ended in an acquittal on the human trafficking charges.140

Van stekkie tot stickie case
This case, like the Fleurtop case, involved Bulgarians employed in the cannabis-growing sec-
tor. Also like the Fleurtop case, a number of female workers were reportedly sexually abused. 
Seven suspects were tried. In addition to human trafficking,141 the charges included rape,142 peo-
ple smuggling, growing and preparing cannabis and participation in a criminal organisation. 
The district court in Rotterdam convicted the suspects for the last three crimes, but found that 
rape and human trafficking had not been proved.

The public prosecutor in this case argued that the circumstances under which the workers 
had to work could certainly be described as abhorrent by Dutch standards: “[…] an extraor-
dinarily low wage, paid as undeclared income, small (upstairs) rooms in an oppressive envi-
ronment for a high rent, no hot water and no heating (albeit because the gas had been shut 
off for months), and no continued payment of wages in the event of illness”143. The public 
prosecutor also argued: “And during this period, she [one of the victims; BNRM] saw no 

137 Art. 3(b) UN Palermo Protocol: “The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploi-
tation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in 
subparagraph (a) have been used.” Article 1 (2) of the EU Framework Decision: “The consent of a victim of 
trafficking in human beings to the exploitation, intended or actual, shall be irrelevant where any of the means 
set forth in paragraph 1 have been used.”

508

chance of escaping from that situation. She could not leave and was not allowed to leave, or 
at least saw no possibility of leaving.”144.

The court’s reasoning for the acquittal on human trafficking was concise: “It cannot be con-
cluded from the content of the file and the proceedings at the hearing that the persons named 
in charge 1 were exploited. In [the name of the place] the persons who were working in the 
cannabis plantation were not exceptionally poorly paid; people were free to leave when they 
wished; they had their own rooms and they organised joint barbecues.”
In its judgment, the district court only addressed the element of exploitation. Since it found 
that this element had not been proved, the suspects were acquitted of human trafficking. 
As in the Fleurtop case, no additional weight was assigned to the fact that the workers were 
engaged in criminal activities. The rulings are final and irrevocable.

Polish cleaners case
The prosecution of two suspects for the exploitation of Polish cleaners, among other things, 
also led to no convictions for human trafficking. The facts on which the district court145 based 
its decision on this case are as follows.

Dwergarend/ Polish cleaners case
The suspects recruited a number of Polish women to come to the Netherlands to do domestic 
work. Most of the women were in a bad financial position in Poland and were coming to the 
Netherlands to earn money. The women themselves made the decision to come to the Neth-
erlands, where the suspects arranged accommodation and cleaning work (mainly for private 
individuals) for them. The women spoke no Dutch. They received less than the minimum wage 
(up to €6.50 per hour) and sometimes had to perform unpaid work. According to most of the 
women, there was an atmosphere of fear in the dwelling they were staying in. Stories circulated 
that they would be raped or knocked down by a car if they ran away. The suspects did nothing 
to dispel these fears.

In assessing whether there had been complicity in human trafficking, the district court in 
The Hague looked at the meaning of the term ‘exploitation’, referring to a non-exhaustive 
list of indicators of exploitation in the NRM’s fifth report. The court observed that the 
women were not informed of their rights and the suspects abused their ignorance regard-
ing their legal position. Accordingly, the court found it plausible that it would be difficult 
for the workers to stop working, since they would then have no income or accommodation. 
Nonetheless, a number of the women returned independently to Poland or started working 
for themselves in the Netherlands as cleaners. Although there was evidently a realistic and 
demonstrable alternative for some of the women, the court found that the means of coercion 
‘abuse of a vulnerable position’ had been used.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

509

The court ruled that in this case the following indicators of exploitation had been met: (1) 
deception (misusing the workers’ ignorance of his or her legal position), (2) poor working 
conditions (the worker was not paid the minimum wage) and (3) multiple dependency (the 
workers depended on the employer for shelter). The court found that it had not been proved 
that the suspects had used or threatened to use physical violence against the workers.
In the court’s view, the suspects had acted extremely reprehensibly in consciously abusing 
the Polish women’s vulnerable position.146 The court condemned the suspects for infringing 
socially accepted ideas of what constitutes good employment practices but found that, since 
in its view the working and living conditions were not extraordinarily bad, there was no situ-
ation of excesses that violated fundamental rights and there was therefore no situation of ex-
ploitation within the meaning of Article 273f (1) (1) and (6) Dutch Criminal Code. The court 
referred to excesses in the plural. An accumulation of less serious abuses can also result in 
excess in the sense of exploitation. The excess then lies in the accumulation of abuses.NRM5

In this case, the court referred to the indicators of exploitation and found that three of the 
indicators were present.

Mehak
At the end of 2007 the District Court in The Hague handed down the first convictions for 
human trafficking outside the sex industry in the Mehak case.147

Mehak case
A married couple from India were convicted for exploiting three other Indian people whom 
they employed for domestic work. The victims came to the Netherlands with the help of the 
suspects and were entirely dependent on them. They received a very small wage and were giv-
en board and lodging in the suspects’ house. They did not have free access to their money or 
passports,148 worked long days, were in the same environment day in and day out and were 
severely impeded in their contact with the outside world. They had no privacy whatsoever and 
were subjected to physical violence.

A striking feature of the case is that no charges were brought under Article 273f (1)(4). The 
charges relating to Section 273f only pertained to section 1(1) of the Dutch Criminal Code. 
Since the actions (sheltering, accommodating) commenced before 1 January 2005, when Ar-
ticle 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code had not yet taken effect, the court confined itself to the 

146 Interestingly, the court in this case found that it had been proven that the suspect had consciously abused the 
vulnerable position of the Polish women. What is clear is that in this case the initiative came from the sus-
pect. Nevertheless, by contrast with the Chinese restaurant case, the court did not say this in so many words. 
However, the court did not find that the nature of the work constituted exploitation within the meaning of 
section 2 of Article 273f Dutch Criminal Code. 

147 The Hague District Court, 14 December 2007, LJN: BC1195 and LJN: BC1761. This was a mega case on 
charges including asssault resulting in the death of an infant. The human trafficking was ‘an added bonust’ in 
this case, which is discussed in more detail in the text box on culture in cases of other forms of exploitation 
(§12.5.1) and in §6.3 on the non-punishment principle.

148 The visas of the victims lapsed after some time, making them illegal immigrants.

period from 1 January 2005 in its judgment. Since the accommodation was provided for the 
victims on a continuous basis, even after 1 January 2005, there was no difficulty in finding 
that the act of accommodating had been proved. In the judgments, which are not yet final and 
irrevocable, the court based its opinion that the situation involved a case of modern slavery, 
based on the explanatory memorandum to Article 273a/f Dutch Criminal Code,149 earlier 
case law and the literature. The court based its reasoning on the criterion that there must be 
objective excess, or circumstances that are unacceptable according to standards that apply in 
Dutch society and the legal system. What is normative is the violation of fundamental rights 
– physical integrity, emotional integrity or personal liberty. Factors in determining whether 
there has been a violation are the seriousness and duration of the coercion used and the eco-
nomic advantage to be gained. The court found that the victims’ consent to the situation is 
irrelevant if any of the means of coercion is used.150 The victims’ subjective perception can 
play a role in deciding whether they could have removed themselves from the power exerted 
by the suspects. In the ruling, the victims’ subjective perception was a major factor in the 
finding that the victims felt they had no real alternative other than to work for the couple.

In evaluating whether this case involved human trafficking, the court took the following cir-
cumstances in to account:

 – the exceptionally low pay – by Dutch standards – for the work (€23.75 to €50.00 per 
month). The court noted that the free room and board did not alter the fact that the pay 
was extremely low;

 – the very long (sometimes extremely long) working days;
 – payments were not made, or not made in full, to the victims personally;
 – the victims’ passports were kept in a suitcase151;
 – the victims were in the same environment day in and day out, with little or no contact of 

any kind with the outside world;
 – the complete lack of privacy. The three victims stated that they had no room of their own. 

They also stated that the suspects frequently called them at the house to check what they 
were doing. “Even telephone conversations with family in India were fully controlled by 
[A].”152 There was therefore little or no privacy;

 – the physical violence.153

All of the facts and circumstances taken into account together meant, in the court’s opinion, 
that there was an excessive situation in which the physical and emotional integrity and per-
sonal liberty of the victims were violated to a far-reaching degree. They performed forced 
labour, since they could not escape from the sphere of influence of the suspects. The judge

found that the extreme underpayment in relation to the working hours and other conditions 
demonstrated the intention of exploitation.154

The court did ascertain a certain ‘duality’, since the victims came to the Netherlands vol-
untarily to work and were grateful to the suspects for enabling them to do so. However, 
this does not detract from the actual impossibility, once in the Netherlands, of escaping the 
hopeless situation under inhuman conditions, which the court deemed could be character-
ised as a situation of servitude as referred to in Section 273f (2) of the Dutch Criminal Code. 
This ‘duality’ observed by the court shows striking parallels with the situation of the workers 
in the aforementioned Chinese restaurant case. They, too, started working voluntarily and 
were grateful that the suspects offered them work and shelter. At the same time, it was ascer-
tained in both cases that the workers/victims were in a vulnerable or hopeless and degrading 
position. In the Chinese restaurant case, the deciseive factor was ultimately the initiative or 
positive action with respect to abuse of the vulnerable position of the victims, which the dis-
trict court and the court of appeal in Den Bosch said was required and had not been proved. 
In the Mehak case, an initiative or positive action on the part of the suspects was not a crite-
rion as regards the means of coercion.

Another parallel with cases discussed earlier can be found in the grounds given for the pun-
ishment of both suspects. The court stated: “The fact that they perhaps also believed they 
were doing these people a favour by allowing them to work for them in the Netherlands does 
not detract from [the human trafficking, BNRM].”155 Similar defences were put forward by 
suspects in other cases as well. One of the suspects in the Polish cleaners case, for instance, 
made the following statement: “All I was doing was helping the women. I understood where 
they came from.”156

In the Mehak case, A, the mistress of the house, was sentenced to three years and nine 
months in prison.157 B, the master of the house, was sentenced to two years and three months 
in prison.158 Both suspects are fugitives.159 The public prosecution service has appealed both 
rulings.

The district court in Zwolle-Lelystad handled another case relating to other forms of exploi-
tation, involving Indians living illegally in the Netherlands.160

154 The district court found violence, misuse of a vulnerable position and misuse of authority arising from the 
actual state of affairs to be means of coercion that had been proven.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

512

 
Moonfish
In this case, three brothers from India were tried on suspicion of exploiting Indians in their tofu 
factory. The workers, who usually offered themselves for work at a Sikh temple, performed 
heavy labour in the tofu factory. They usually worked long hours, six days a week. The pay was 
low. The workers were dependent on the suspects for work, transport and accommodation. 
They were housed in the home of one of the brothers, where some of them had to share a bed.

Before arriving at the question of whether the workers were exploited, the court first con-
sidered whether acts had been performed that constituted misuse of a weaker or vulnerable 
position on the part of the workers. Like the court of appeal in Den Bosch in the Chinese 
restaurant case, the Zwolle district court argued that this assumed some initiative and posi-
tive action on the part of the suspects.
First and foremost, the district court found that the workers were in a vulnerable position 
simply because they were living in the Netherlands illegally. To this point, the district court’s 
reasoning is virtually identical to that of the appeal court in Den Bosch in the Chinese res-
taurant case. By contrast with the court in the Chinese restaurant case, however, in the 
Moonfish case the district court in Zwolle found that the suspects had taken the initiative 
and had acted consciously by transporting, accommodating and sheltering the Indian men, 
in the process abusing the victims’ vulnerable position, and with the aim of deriving benefit 
from the recruitment of cheap labour for a tofu factory. The court based this finding on the 
following facts and circumstances:

 – The workers were living in the Netherlands illegally and were not legally permitted to 
work, which the suspects knew.

 – The workers (or their families) had incurred substantial debts to finance their journey to 
Europe.

 – The workers spoke no Dutch and had no identity papers.
 – The work in the factory was onerous by Dutch standard.
 – The workers generally worked six days a week, often for more than eight hours a day, for 

€800 per month. No overtime was paid. The workers paid the suspects €100 a month in 
rent.

 – Eight people were living in one dwelling, arranged by the suspects, and some had to share 
a bed.

 – The suspects also provided the transport to and from work.
 – The workers were not insured for medical costs.
 – No taxes or social insurance premiums were paid for them.

The court found that although most of the workers had voluntarily offered their services, 
which meant that no active recruitment was necessary, nevertheless such active and deliber-
ate action had been undertaken as to constitute misuse of the victim’s vulnerable position. 
The active and deliberate action was related to the transport, accommodation and sheltering 
of the illegal workers. The workers’ vulnerable position had been misused with these actions. 
The manner in which the workers found the work is reminiscent of the Chinese restaurant

513

case, in which the workers themselves also approached the suspects for work. For the court 
of appeal in Den Bosch, however, the workers’ initiative was the decisive factor for assuming 
that the suspects did not actively abuse their vulnerable position.

Having established that by their actions the suspects had misused the illegal workers’ vulner-
able position, the court considered whether there was exploitation or an intention of exploi-
tation. The court described the situation as socially undesirable but felt there was no inten-
tion of exploitation. Referring to the criterion used in the NRM’s fifth report to distinguish 
exploitation as referred to in Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code from other abuses,161 
the court ruled that the circumstances were insufficiently serious to be described as viola-
tion of fundamental rights. In the court’s opinion, therefore, the situation was not excessive, 
and it ruled that there was no relationship of debt bondage between the suspects and the 
workers and that the suspects did not hold the workers’ identity papers so there was not such 
an excessive labour relationship, multiple dependency or lack of freedom that the Indians did 
not reasonably have any other choice than to work for the suspects. However, the question is 
the same as in the Chinese restaurant case: what was the workers’ alternative?

The court provided little in the way of a specific explanation as to why it did not feel the 
situation was excessive. It merely concluded that there were long working days and weeks 
involving onerous work for an income that did not match market rates.162

The court did find that people smuggling had been proved, however. In its grounds for the 
sentence, the court found as follows: “The court considers it very serious that the suspect 
and his co-perpetrators placed illegal aliens in such an undesirable situation and made them 
work under extremely bad conditions: long working days, working weeks of six days, hav-
ing to share a bed, income of no more than €800 per month, no payment for overtime, and 
no medical insurance. This is completely unacceptable according to Dutch standards.” The 
public prosecution service has appealed the rulings.

Mentally impaired person
The District Court in Utrecht dealt with the second case involving other forms of exploita-
tion that resulted in a conviction.163

Case of a mentally impaired person
The suspect and victim both lived alone in the same apartment building. The two were initially 
friends. Over the course of time, they saw each other on a daily basis, and the suspect had the 
victim perform household work (washing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning windows). He also got 

161 There is coercion, poor terms of employment or working conditions or multiple dependency and the victim 
does not have or does not reasonably feel he or she has the freedom to leave the working situation. 

162 It is not possible to discover from the judgment (without investigating the case file) precisely how long the 
working days were. If it is assumed on the basis of the above that the working week was six days, at eight 
hours a day, for €800 a month, the wage could not have been more than €3.85 an hour.

the victim, a Dutch man who functions at the level of a ten-year-old child because of a mental 
impairment, to take over his job delivering mail for a month and a half. The suspect paid the 
victim for this once, in the amount of €50. The victim worked at a sheltered workshop and had 
to perform the various activities for the suspect in addition to his own job. The man also had to 
get up early in the morning to make the suspect’s breakfast and coffee before going to work. In 
that context, the suspect once made the victim pay him €50 for making the wrong coffee. The 
man also had to fetch 15 euros worth of cannabis for the suspect and pay for it himself when-
ever the suspect felt he had done something wrong. Finally, the court accepted that the suspect 
had regularly kicked the victim and twice held a burning cigarette against his hand. The events 
occurred over the course of slightly more than a year.

The public prosecution service charged the suspect under both Section 273f (1)(1) and (1)
(4) Dutch Criminal Code. In order to decide whether there had been a situation of criminal 
exploitation, the court considered the following three questions in order: (1) Was there work 
or services? (2) Was there a possible situation of exploitation? and (3) Was there exploitation 
to such an extent that human rights were violated? All three questions were answered in the 
affirmative.
The victim had to perform household tasks, buy cannabis and deliver parcels for the suspect 
without receiving reasonable compensation. Work and services were therefore performed.
The court then addressed the second question: Was there a situation of exploitation? The 
court took into account the fact that the suspect knew the victim was vulnerable and impres-
sionable and did not dare to refuse. He took advantage of this by making him work in his 
place without providing reasonable compensation. An additional factor was that he threat-
ened to hit the victim if he did not perform the tasks properly and did actually assault him. 
As a result of his mental impairment, the victim did not reasonably have the possibility of 
extracting himself from the situation. He was consequently in an involuntary situation in 
which he was forced to perform the activities demanded by the suspect. The court said that 
this made it a situation of exploitation.
Although the court found that exploitation had been proved, which in itself implies that hu-
man rights had been violated, it considered the question of a human rights violation sepa-
rately. However, exploitation already implies a violation of human rights, so this question 
should therefore not need to be answered separately if, in the court’s opinion, exploitation in 
the sense of Section 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code has been proved. In this case, the court 
ruled that the victim’s human dignity and personal liberty had been violated.

Since the suspect’s lawyer argued in his plea whether there was intention of exploitation (un-
der 1), the court then specifically addressed that question, arriving at the conclusion that, 
in addition to the actual exploitation, there had also been the intention to exploitation. The 
court was convinced that the suspect took the victim into his house in order to have the man 
work for him. The suspect also transported the victim with the aim of having him deliver 
parcels. This all implies that the suspect acted intentionally, and the court deemed that it had 
been proved that the actions were undertaken with the intention of exploitation.

The suspect was sentenced to a prison term of seven months, four months of which were 
conditional, with a probabtion period of two years. The suspect was also given a community 
service order of 120 hours and ordered to pay compensation to the state for the benefit of the 
victim. The court imposed the order for compensation for emotional injury ex officio and 
fixed the initial amount of compensation at €500.164

The imported bride165

In the next case in which charges of human trafficking in the sense of other forms of exploita-
tion were filed, six suspects stood trial for, among other things, the exploitation of a family 
member, a young Moroccan woman.166

The imported bride
A young Moroccan woman was brought to the Netherlands by her in-laws when she married 
the principal suspect. The public prosecutor argued that the bride had to live with her in-laws 
despite an agreement to the contrary, was prevented from leaving the home, was made to per-
form household tasks, was mistreated, was prevented by the in-laws from contacting her fam-
ily and was prevented from participating in society by being kept for a long time in almost total 
isolation by her in-laws.167

The suspects were charged under Article 273f (1) (1) and (1) (4) of the Dutch Criminal Code. 
With regard to the charges based on section (1) (1), the District Court in Rotterdam ruled 
that it had to be established that the suspects had the intention of exploiting the bride at the 
time she was brought to the country. In the court’s opinion, however, the primary objective 
of bringing the bride to the country was to enable her to live a married life with one of the 
suspects. The only evidence that suggested otherwise was the bride’s statement, but that 
statement only reflected the bride’s conclusion following her actual stay. The court said that 
this was ipso facto insufficient to prove intent. The court therefore found that the charges 
brought under section (1) (1) had not been proved. It is noteworthy that the court ruled in fa-
vour of the suspects in terms of what their primary intention was.168 The question is whether, 
it is relevant if, with regard to that intention, an objective is primary or secondary. It is also 
not unusual to conclude the intention from later actions. The court does not comment on 
this, however.

The court then considered whether the bride had been coerced and/or induced to perform 
household work (section (1) (4)). Here too, the court encountered evidentiary problems. 
Since, in the court’s opinion, the case file contained no other evidence to support the com-
plainant’s statements that she had been coerced into performing household work, the court

also found that the charges under section (1) (4) had not been proved. The court noted, un-
necessarily, that it did suspect that the bride had been left to her fate in the Netherlands by 
the family and that ‘to a certain extent’ she had been charged with household duties. The 
court also found that the family did not meet its duty of care towards a new member of the 
family who was largely dependent on her family.

The six family members were charged not only with human trafficking, but also illegal depri-
vation of liberty. Four family members were also suspected of assault, and the bride’s spouse 
was charged with both rape and causing grievous bodily harm. Although the court found 
that these charges had not been proved either, it did base its ruling on the following facts and 
circumstances.
With regard to the charges of deprivation of liberty, the court found: “Of the offences with 
which the suspects are charged, the court only considers it proven that the complainant did 
not have her own key to the home, it was made difficult for her to contact her family in Belgium 
and Morocco, and that she was accompanied by family members on visits to agencies.”169 As 
regards causing grievous bodily harm, with which the bride’s spouse was charged, the court 
ruled: “On the complainant’s body, the forensic doctors found, […] among other things, a 
scar above her right eyebrow and on her right lower arm, which could perhaps be explained 
by actions of which the suspect is accused in the charge but with which the forensic doctors 
could not ascertain a causal relationship with sufficient certainty.”170 Finally, with regard to 
the rape with which the spouse was charged, the court ruled that the forensic doctor had 
found scar tissue near the vagina but could not make any pronouncement on when the injury 
had occurred or confirm or rule out a causal connection with rape.

It is noticeable that the court separated the different facts in evaluating the offences charged 
and did not consider them in combination with each other in deciding whether there was hu-
man trafficking involved. Human trafficking in the sense of other forms of exploitation is an 
offence in which a conviction frequently depends on an accumulation of circumstances that 
can only lead to a finding that the offence has been proved by considering them in relation to 
each other171 (see also §11.3.4).

The suspects were all acquitted on all charges. The rulings were not appealed.

Abuse by social worker
A decision that also resulted in the acquittal on charges of other forms of exploitation in-
volved a case in which a social worker with the Dutch Mental Healthcare Agency (GGZ) was 
tried for exploiting one of his female clients.172

517

 
Case of abuse by social worker
In the course of his work for the GGZ, the suspect came into contact with the victim after 
becoming her case manager. During this supervision, the social worker and his client formed a 
relationship, which ultimately resulted in the woman moving in with the suspect at the latter’s 
initiative. In his closing statement, the public prosecutor put forward the following circum-
stances: the woman did all of the suspect’s housekeeping, she regularly had to have sex with 
him, she was persuaded to take out loans for the suspect and the suspect regularly withdrew 
money from her account.173 According to the public prosecutor, the case involved the coerced 
performance of work or services and financial exploitation.

The suspect was charged under both Article 273f (1)(1) and (1)(4) Dutch Criminal Code. With 
regard to the means of coercion the suspect was charged with using,174 the court found that 
the suspect “certainly abused his position as care provider and the vulnerability of [victim 
2],”175 having earlier established that “the initiative for forming the relationship came from 
the suspect and [victim 2] has stated that she consented because she wanted the attention 
and trust of the suspect.” But the court evidently did not feel that the use of any means of 
coercion had been proved. On that point, the court found: “Exploitation presumes a cer-
tain degree of involuntariness or subjection, whereby the situation of exploitation violates 
fundamental human rights, such as human dignity or personal liberty. Taken as a whole, the 
actions of the exploiter must be aimed at limiting the victim’s options to such an extent that 
the victim sees no other possibility than to submit to the exploiter’s wishes. In the court’s 
opinion, there was no question of that in this case, since it has not been established that [vic-
tim 2] ended up in such a situation of dependence involuntarily.” In light of the conviction 
under Article 249 (2) (3) of the Dutch Criminal Code176 in relation to the same victim, this 
reasoning is difficult to comprehend. This conviction indicates that the suspect had a posi-
tion of authority over the victim arising from the actual relationship, and therefore there was 
also authority arising from the actual state of affairs within the meaning of Article 273f (1) 
Dutch Criminal Code.
If any of the means of coercion is used, the victim’s consent is irrelevant.

Nor did the court find any intention to exploit (subsection (1) (1)). The court found that intent 
had not been sufficiently established: “Although the suspect at times acted […] the court has 
not been convinced that he built up his contact with [victim 2] exclusively with a view to be-

173 Public prosecutor’s closing statement, 27 January 2009.
174 “[…] (use and/or misuse of a psychological authority which the suspect (repeatedly), also in view of his ca-

pacity as responsible case manager and/or supervisor employed by the Dutch Mental Health Care Agency 
in [place name] or as a certified and registered health care worker/nurse (with a so-called BIG (Professionals 
in Individual Health Care) registration, via the suspect’s company/agency [company name] and/or the psy-
chological condition of [name of victim; BNRM], over [name of victim]”.

175 Leeuwarden District Court, 10 February 2009, LJN: BH2373.
176 The essence of criminality under Article 249 of the Dutch Criminal Code is the inequality in the positions of 

the offender and the victim. Subsection 3 of this article reads: “a person who, working in heath care or social 
care, commits an indecent act with a person under his authority or his charge as a patient or a client.”

ing able to exploit her.”177 The insertion of the word ‘exclusively’ in this sentence is confusing. 
There is no requirement for the intent to be exclusively focused on exploitation.

The suspect was sentenced to two years in prison for committing indecent acts with the 
woman and another client. He was also disbarred from his profession for seven years. The 
public prosecution department appealed the ruling.

Garage owner
This case before the district court in Almelo involved a Serbian man staying in the Nether-
lands illegally, who worked at the suspect’s garage for €5 per hour.178

The court first considered the question of whether there was misuse of authority or of a 
weaker/vulnerable position. The court decided that the victim was in a vulnerable position 
because he was residing in the Netherlands illegally. In determining whether the suspect also 
misused this vulnerable position, the court took the following circumstances into account: 
the worker had personally taken the decision to come to the Netherlands, he could not find 
work in Serbia, he had debts in Serbia and was therefore unable to support his family, his 
illegal status prevented him from earning an income legally in the Netherlands, it was he 
who approached the suspect’s company seeking work, it was agreed he would be paid €5 an 
hour, this money was paid weekly and was entirely at the worker’s disposal, the worker was 
not bound to the suspect by any monetary debt or other obligation and he was free to stop 
working work and to leave at any time. In light of these circumsatnces, the court decided 
that there was no abuse of a vulnerable position. In reaching this decision, the court used the 
same criterion as the court of appeal in Den Bosch in the Chinese restaurant case,179 “On the 
above grounds, the court is of the opinion that the suspect cannot be said to have taken the 
required initiative or to have taken positive action with respect to said person, for example by 
approaching him or persuading him to come and work at the company.”180 Since the means 
was not proved, the court did not address the question of whether there was exploitation or 
intention of exploitation in this case. The court did not explicitly comment on the charge 
based on the sixth subsection of Article 273f (1): wilfully profiting from the exploitation of 
another person. After all, even if the means of coercion is not proved, there can still be a case 
of profiting from exploitation.
The suspect was acquitted of human trafficking and money laundering, but the court did 
find that he was guilty of people smuggling (the employment of an alien remaining unlaw-
fully in the Netherlands, Section 197b Dutch Criminal Code). The suspect was sentenced to 
150 hours of community service. The worker’s claim for back wages and for damages were 
declared inadmissible because it was too complex.

Forced drug smuggling
In April 2009, the district court in Haarlem rendered the third conviction for other forms of 
exploitation.181

Case of forced drug smuggling
In this case the victim was lured to Curacao by the suspect (her ex-boyfriend) under false pre-
tences. By making serious threats against the woman and her child, the suspect made it clear 
to the woman that she had to transport cocaine to the Netherlands, and then raped her. At a 
later date, the suspect pushed the packages of cocaine into the woman’s body. The victim said 
she didn’t want to participate in the smuggling, but the suspect refused to listen. The suspect 
made a number of threats against the woman and her three-month-old baby during the acts. 
The victim ultimately left for the Netherlands with the packets of cocaine in her body and was 
arrested on arrival there.

The suspect was charged not only with human trafficking (Section 273f (1) (4) of the Dutch 
Criminal Code) but also with rape and causing another person to smuggle drugs. The Dis-
trict Court in Haarlem decided that all three offences had been proved.
With regard to the charges of human trafficking,182 the court found that it had been proved 
that the suspect had forced the woman to perform services (transporting narcotics to the 
Netherlands) by forcibly inserting the packets of cocaine into her vagina and anus and saying 
in a threatening tone: “You just do what I say” and “If you don’t do it, you’ll get the Colom-
bian necktie and I’ll throw your child in the sea”.
As stated, the court also convicted on the charges of rape and causing another person to 
smuggle drugs. The judicial finding of fact on the offence of causing another person to 
smuggle drugs was particularly relevant for the victim, since this finding that the suspect 
caused another person to smuggle drugs established that she is not an offender. The vic-
tim could therefore not be prosecuted for drug smuggling.183 In its grounds for the sentence, 
the court said: “In causing said import, the suspect abused the complainant [the victim], a 
former girlfriend, whom the suspect treated as nothing more than a mechanical device, an 
implement.”184

In accordance with the public prosecution service’s demand, the suspect was sentenced to 
four years in prison. The court also awarded the claim of 1500 euro in compensation for the 
emotional injury suffered by the victim.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

Chinese massage parlours
The most recent decision concerning other forms of exploitation known to BNRM at time 
of writing185 was the following.

Chinese massage parlours
Two Chinese men and a Chinese woman were suspected of exploiting Chinese women living 
in the Netherlands illegally in two massage parlours cum manicure studios.186 In these massage 
parlours, massages were given for €30 an hour, of which €12 went to the masseuse and €18 to 
the employer. According to the public prosecution service, the illegal workers received lower 
wages than legal workers, they had to perform sexual acts with customers for payment and 
they were housed in poor conditions by the suspects. The proceeds from any sexual services 
performed by the masseuses were split fifty-fifty between the worker and the suspects.

As emerges from the terminology used, the indictment (the charges were brought by the 
National Public Prosecutor’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Offences 
in this case) relates mainly to ‘other forms of exploitation’. In the section concerning Article 
273f (1)(4) Dutch Criminal Code, the suspect was charged that “by abusing authority arising 
from the actual state of affairs and/or by abusing the vulnerable position of said persons, he 
induced (women) to make themselves available for performing work or services (subsection 
4), the work or services consisting of, among other things, work as a masseuse in [names of 
the massage parlours]”.187 The suspect was also charged under Section 273f (1)(9). The charg-
es read that “the suspect and/or his co-perpetrator(s) offered these women work that con-
sisted of massaging men and/or providing sexual services to these men, or at least work that 
in different circumstances those women would not have performed or not for the wages they 
received” and “whereby the benefits from the proceeds of said persons’ sexual acts consisted 
of the fact that said persons had to surrender to the suspect and/or his co-perpetrator(s) a 
part of the proceeds from the sexual acts performed by them with one or more third parties 
in the massage parlours of the suspect and/or his co-perpetrator(s) and/or elsewhere”.

The public prosecutor seems to have disregareded the fact that sexual acts with a third par-
ty constitutes prostitution and that if a person is induced to perform them with any of the 
means of coercion, it is a case of forced prostitution and, hence, also human trafficking. So 
in addition to the exploitation in the massage parlours (other forms of exploitation) cited 
in the charges, it would have been reasonable to include a separate charge of exploitation in 
prostitution in the indictment.
The court subsequently acquitted the suspects on all the charges connected with the human

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

With regard to the means of coercion, the court found as follows: “The court therefore con-
siders it plausible that their illegal status forced said women to accept this work and that 
they would not have performed this work, or at least not for the wages they received for it, 
if they had been staying in the Netherlands legally, so that in that sense there is a certain 
degree of involuntariness. After all, the women concerned had to survive and under those 
circumstances, as [name of victim] and [name of victim] have stated, there were just happy 
to have found paid employment”. In addition, the court said: “Nor has it been shown that the 
persons concerned did not have the freedom to leave the work situation. The mere fact that 
they were illegal aliens is insufficient in that context. After all, as [victim’s name] also stated, 
there were other ways of earning money if they could no longer work in the suspect’s par-
lour.” Although the court evidently felt that it had been proved that a number of the women 
also provided sexual services (the agreements for which were made with the customers con-
cerned by the suspects and the proceeds from which were split fifty-fifty with the women), 
the court seems to have disregarded the fact that with regard to exploitation in prostitution 
and profiting from the proceeds of a prostitute’s sexual acts, the hourly rate188 and accom-
modation189 are irrelevant.
The court therefore evidently makes no distinction between exploitation in prostitution and 
other forms of exploitation, which, even though the charges were unfortunately formulated 
on this point, certainly would have been possible on the grounds of the charges under Section 
273f (1)(4) Dutch Criminal Code and should have been made on the grounds of the charges 
under Section 273f (1)(9).190 Even if the court found that the coercion had not been proved 
and the findings regarding the hourly rate and housing can be regarded as superfluous, the 
distinction should have been made.

Although the three suspects were acquitted of human trafficking, the court ruled that the of-
fences of participation in a criminal organisation (Section 140 of the Dutch Criminal Code) 
and people smuggling (Section 197a of the Dutch Criminal Code) and violations of Sections 
68 and 69 of the State Taxes Act had been proved. The suspects were each sentenced to 18 
months in prison, nine of which were imposed conditionally with a probationary period of 
two years. In all three cases, the suspects and the public prosecution service both appealed 
the verdicts.

188 On the hourly rate, the court ruled: “In the court’s opinion, it follows from these statements that the per-
sons concerned worked for a very low hourly rate, of which the suspects [the names of the suspects] also 
demanded a disproportionate share”.

189 On the accommodation, the court found: “However, it has not been established that the suspects and his 
fellow suspects also provided them with shelter that did not comply with the requirements of reasonable and 
decent accommodation. Leaving aside the fact that only three of them stated that they slept in the salon, the 
case file contains no evidence that the accommodation was inadequate in the aformentioned sense”.

12.4.3 A comparative international survey

As announced in the introduction to §12.6, as part of its survey of judicial decisions on cases 
of other forms of exploitation, BNRM also examined legislation and case law on this point 
in a number of other countries. The aim was to gain an insight into how the legislatures 
and courts in other countries interpret the various elements of other forms of exploitation. 
The Netherlands may be able to learn from the legal frameworks and judgment in the other 
countries.
The comparative legal survey focused on Belgium, France, Norway and the United States.191 
Human trafficking for other forms of exploitation has been a criminal offence in Belgium 
and the United States for a relatively long time, and these countries therefore have greater 
experience in prosecuting these forms of exploitation. France stands out for its strict inter-
pretation of the UN Palermo Protocol. Finally, Norway is included in the survey because it 
is a European country that has ratified the UN Palermo Protocol but is not bound by the EU 
Framework Decision on human trafficking (2002) because it is not a member state of the 
EU.

In order to make a comparison with the situation in the Netherlands, this section discusses a 
selection of laws and cases concerning other forms of exploitation in the other countries.192

Definition of the offence
France, Norway and Belgium have included the definitions of the offence of human traffick-
ing under titles in the criminal code that characterise human trafficking as a violation of hu-
man dignity, personal liberty or physical integrity.193 It is conspicuous that the criminalisation 
of other forms of exploitation is provided for in the national legislation of the countries sur-
veyed both in separate articles and consolidated in a single article. For instance, the United 
States has four terms for economic exploitation in criminal law: forced labour (18 USC par. 
1589), involuntary servitude (18 USC par. 1584), peonage (18 USC par. 1581) and slavery (18 
USC par. 1583). Contrary to the situation in the Netherlands, these forms of exploitation are 
contained in separate provisions of the criminal law. The US also has another section that 
criminalises actions relating to preparing and facilitating exploitation.194 As is the case with 

191 For a discussion of case law in other countries, see ILO, 2009, Forced labour and human trafficking. Casebook 
of Court decisions. Switzerland: ILO; and Coster van Voorhout, 2009, Human trafficking for labour exploita-
tion.

192 It was not the intention to provide a complete overview of the jurisprudence in countries that were studied. 
Furthermore, only the legislation relevant to other forms of exploitation is discussed. The research methods 
are explained in Appendix 2.

193 The Belgian human trafficking article is currently to be found in Book 2, Title VIII (Offences and serious 
crimes against the person), Chapter IIIter (Human Trafficking), Articles 433quinquies, 433sexies, 433septies, 
433octies and 433novies of the Criminal Code. In France, Chapter V of the Code Pénal (offences against hu-
man dignity) in Articles 225-4-1 to 225-4-9 of the Code Pénal. Norway, in Part II of the Almindelig borgerlig 
Straffelov (Strl), chapter 21 ‘offences against personal liberty’, § 224. The US in Title 18 - Crimes And Crimi-
nal Procedure Part I – Crimes, Chapter 77 - Peonage, Slavery, And Trafficking In Persons.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

523

Section 273f Dutch Criminal Code, Belgium, France and Norway have included different 
forms of exploitation in a single, central provision of criminal law. In addition to sexual and 
economic exploitation, these provisions also explicitly refer to other forms of exploitation, 
such as coercing another person to beg (Belgium195 and France196), coercing another person 
to commit crimes (Belgium197 and France198) and coercing another person to perform mili-
tary service abroad (Norway199). Belgium also has a provision that, although it doesn’t fall 
under human trafficking, does criminalise the accommodation of vulnerable illegal aliens in 
conditions that are contrary to human dignity (rack-renter practices).200

As regards the scope of the human trafficking provisions, France adopts a narrow definition 
of the term human trafficking, as set out in the EU Framework Decision and the UN Palermo 
Protocol. Only the actions to prepare and facilitate human trafficking with the aim of exploit-
ing a person are criminalised as human trafficking per se in France. If the actual exploitation 
started, and therefore manifests itself in the work environment, this conduct does not fall un-
der the central human trafficking article, 225-4-1 of the Code Pénal, but under entirely differ-
ent provisions of French criminal law and other legal regimes.201 Under section 225-4-1 of the 
Code Pénal, the suspect’s intention to exploit will have to be proved before the exploitation 
actually manifests itself. However, the preparations for human trafficking will be difficult to 
identify before the exploitation has taken place. As far as BNRM is aware,202 there have been 
no cases that have led to convictions for other forms of exploitation under this provision in 
France. A potentially problematic aspect in this context is that French judges view manifest 
situations of exploitation, which constitute the offence of human trafficking according to the 
EU Framework Decision and the UN Palermo Protocol, from a perspective of labour law or 
as a form of poor employment practices.
Unlike the French legislation, the Norwegian legislation is interpreted to mean that the vic-
tims ‘have been subjected to forced labour’. This formulation by the court seems to indicate 
that the definition of the offence in §224, paragraph 1 Strl, under b) requires that forced la-
bour has actually occurred.203

195 Article 433 quinquies § 1 sub 2 in conjunction with Article 433ter, Criminal Code.

199 §224 paragraph 1 Strl under c.
200 See Article 433decies of the Criminal Code. This Belgian provision is not covered in the remainder of this 

study.
201 For example, Article 225-13 of the Code Pénal requires, for the purpose of the definition of the offence – 

which encompasses living and working conditions contrary to human dignity (but not in the sense of human 
trafficking) – a du travail accompli. See also Article 225-14 Code Pénal and Article L8221-5 Code du Travail.

2008. The Norwegians seem to have (partially) dealt with this, however, by criminalising a number of facili-
tating and preparatory activities for human trafficking as forms of participation in human trafficking on the 
grounds of §224 paragraph 2 Strl.

Means of coercion
As in the Netherlands, in Norway and the US the use of certain means of coercion is an ele-
ment of the offence of human trafficking. In Belgium, by contrast, the use of coercion is an 
aggravating circumstance.205 Coercion was a component under the old Belgian human traf-
ficking law,206 but producing evidence of coercion proved problematic. The new legislation 
was intended to put an end to these evidentiary problems.207 In France, the only means of co-
ercion included in the definition of the offence of human trafficking is the receipt of money 
or any other benefit, emphasising the commercial nature of exploitation. Other means of 

204  Section 103 gives a definition of ‘severe forms of human trafficking’, but it is not a provision making it a crim-
inal offence, although Section 103 does give an abridged description of the various elements in different 
American human trafficking articles.

coercion mentioned in the EU Framework Decision, the UN Palermo Protocol and Article 
273f of the Dutch Criminal Code are aggravating circumstances in French law.208 Accord-
ingly, Belgium and France also comply with Article 3 (c) of the UN Palermo Protocol, which 
further provides that the use of coercion does not have to be proved if the victim of human 
trafficking is under the age of 18. Norway has a provision to this effect in its law.209

Reservations can be expressed about the omission of means of coercion in the Belgian and 
French definitions of the offence. Work that does involve coercion or abuse of a vulnerable 
position, but not a violation of human dignity,210 might not fall under the scope of the current 
provision. It is also possible to argue the opposite. Since the Belgian and French definitions 
of the offence have not included coercion or abuse of a vulnerable position, forms of illegal 
work or illegal employment could be prosecuted under the central human trafficking provi-
sions.211 Case law shows, however, that this latter reservation does not apply for Belgium.212

The means of coercion included in the law on human trafficking in Belgium, France,213 Nor-
way and the US largely correspond with the means stipulated in Article 273f Dutch Criminal 
Code; such means as threats, force, the use of violence and abuse of a vulnerable position.214 
In Belgium, the coercion does not have to be directed against the victim, but can also affect 
other persons.215 In addition, the American legislature explicitly refers to ‘document confis-
cation’216 and causing ‘psychological, financial, or reputational harm’217 as means of coercion. 
One American provision (18 USC par. 1590), which is solely concerned with preparing and 
facilitating human trafficking, provides that every means can be used however.

Abuse of a vulnerable position
Abuse of the victim’s vulnerable position is a factor in the human trafficking provisions in 
Belgium, France and Norway.218 These countries adopt the terms ‘particularly vulnerable 

208 Article 225-4-2 Code Pénal.
209 §224 Strl.
210 For an interpretation of the term human dignity, see the text under the heading ‘Exploitation’ in this sec-

tion.
211 Vermeulen (2006, p. 18).
212 For example, the Correctional Court in Tongeren (21 December 2006, 9th chamber) acquitted the defend-

ants of human trafficking. The young women who worked in the bar were paid, were not deprived of their 
freedom of movement, threatened or obliged to perform certain acts against their will. Furthermore, they 
could choose to be paid by the day or by the week and could determine their day off. They performed the 
work voluntarily. There was also no evidence that the standards for safety at work and the welfare of the 
employees had not been observed in the café. See also the section under the heading ‘Case law’ for a number 
of successful prosecutions for human trafficking. 

213 Note: in Belgium and France, the use of coercion is an aggravating circumstance.
214 Article 273f (1) (1) of the Dutch Criminal Code might have a broader scope with the inclusion of the phrase

position,219 ‘vulnerability (or dependency)’220 and ‘vulnerable situation’ in their human traf-
ficking articles.221 The international legislation and case law in this study show that a vulner-
able position can arise from both constant and variable factors related to contextual factors 
and the personal characteristics of the victim.222

Belgian and French legislation and jurisprudence show that the vulnerable position of the 
victim is related to the contextual factors arising from the economic or other relationship 
with the human trafficker, illegal status or even an economic crisis in a geographic area.223

Exploitation in the textile industry224

Two years before the introduction of the current human trafficking provision, Article 225-4-1 
of the Code Pénal, the following case came before the court in France. In the Vendée, employ-
ees were being exploited in the textile industry. Employer B prohibited his employers from 
laughing, talking or raising their heads. In the hot summer months, the doors were kept closed, 
and in the winter the heating was not switched on, but employees were not allowed to keep 
their jackets on. B enforced these rules strictly and punished any violations. B. also threatened 
to close down his business so that the employers would end up on the street.

With respect to the employees’ position of dependency, the appeal court ruled that it was re-
flected in their lack of schooling. The appeal court also found that the textile sector was direct-
ly affected by the economic crisis at the time and that the events had occurred in an area where 
there was already a lot of unemployment. The loss of their jobs could therefore have disastrous 
consequences for the employees, according to the appeal court. The court concluded that a 
general economic crisis could create a situation of dependency.
According to the appeal court, the condition ‘à des conditions de travail ou d’hébergement in-
compatibles avec la dignité humaine’ was also met and various elements in the textile company 
together created working conditions that were incompatible with human dignity. This was 
reflected in the extremely strict discipline, the poor physical conditions and the humiliations 
in B’s company and B’s constant reminders that the employees depended on him, as their em-
ployer, for continued employment.
Monsieur B was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 100,000 francs. In the related civil 
case, the victims were each awarded 3,000 francs.

A vulnerable position can also arise from personal characteristics such as youth, psychologi-
cal or physical ailments and illness (Belgium and France).225 226

219 Artikel 433septies sub 2, Belgian Criminal Code. 
220 Artikel 225-4-2 sub 2, Code pénal only mentions ‘une personne dont la particulairè vulnérabilité’. Articles 225-

13 and 225-14 Code Pénal use the term ‘la vulnérabilité ou l’état de dépendance’ (France).
221 §224 Strl (Norway).

08-069332MED-JARE, 4 July 2008. This case is discussed later in this section under the heading ‘Exploitation 
of travellers’.

223 France makes a distinction in Article 225-13 Code pénal between a dependent position and a vulnerable posi-
tion. Note, however, that this is not the central human trafficking article, 225-4-1 Code pénal. See also: Cour

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

528

Most of the Belgian judgments that were studied concerned illegal immigrants as victims of 
other forms of exploitation. Belgian jurisprudence adopted the following reasoning in find-
ing that such cases were abuses of an ‘administrative situation’: the administrative situation 
is related to the victim’s illegal status. The abuse of that situation was then established by the 
payment of a low wage,227 or circumstances concerning the actual employment of the illegal 
employees, their accommodation and the long working hours228. The Correctional Court 
of Charleroi also found that some freedom of movement on the part of the victims did not 
detract from the abuse of their illegal administrative situation in Belgium.229

Unlike the Dutch judgments in the Chinese restaurant and the Garage Owner cases,230 the 
Correctional Court in Ghent231 decided, in a case in which Romanian workers offered their 
services to the defendant, that the victims taking the initiative did not alter the fact that their 
vulnerable position had been abused.

Exploitation in horticulture232

Two Romanians had worked for years maintaining and growing garden plants for the suspect. 
The Romanians had offered their services to the suspect themselves. The workers had no doc-
uments, worked 11 months in the year, for 10 to 14 hours a day, except on Sunday. They lived 
in a caravan. In the early years they were paid very little, and in the last three years they had no 
longer received any wages, apart from €50 a week. When they demanded their money, the sus-
pect replied that he would pay them later. One day, they went to demand their money again and 
then returned to the caravan. To frighten them, the defendant set the caravan on fire.
The court ruled that this was abuse of the vulnerable situation, stressing that the fact that the 
workers had personally offered their services did not affect the abuse. The workers were liv-
ing in the country illegally, were employed illegally and depended on the suspect’s benevolence. 
They were employed in degrading conditions, as was demonstrated by the failure to comply 
with the agreements on payment and the miserable accommodation (the caravan) the defendant 
had provided them with. The aggravating circumstance of abuse of a vulnerable situation was 
also deemed to exist because the employees were staying illegally in Belgium, were employed 
illegally and were subject to the whims of the employer. Furthermore, the victims had no genu-
inely acceptable choice but to suffer the abuse: they continued to work because the defendant 
promised to pay their back wages, which they would not receive if they stopped working.

228 Bruges Correctional Court, 19 June 2007, 14th chamber. Exploitation – in Belgium a violation of human dig-

nity (see the section headed ‘Exploitation’ for an explanation of this term) – requires that the offenders have 
profited or wanted to profit from the human trafficking activity. Such intention to profit was manifested in 
this case by low wages, long working days and poor accommodation.

Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

529

In this case, therefore, there was no requirement that abuse of a vulnerable position assumes 
a certain initiative or action on the part of the perpetrator, as was suggested by the appeal 
court in Den Bosch in the Chinese restaurant case.233 In the countries studied, whether a 
person agreed to the exploitation is irrelevant for a finding of human trafficking if there were 
means of coercion and such means are required by the relevant law.234

In the US, ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’ in not explicitly included in any article on exploita-
tion. The vulnerable position of the victim is far more important for establishing whether the 
coercion used forced the victim to allow himself or herself to be exploited.235 In this context, 
the American legislature and case law refer to personal characteristics and surrounding fac-
tors, although these can vary depending on the article concerning exploitation. For example, 
there is no special protection for illegal immigrants, children and mentally impaired persons 
in the old, and almost unused, human trafficking provisions on ‘peonage’ and ‘involuntary 
servitude’.236 However, 18 USC par. 1590 (c) (1) ‘Trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, 
involuntary servitude, or forced labour’ does provide that the means of coercion ‘abuse of 
the law or legal process’ is a provision actually intended to protect vulnerable persons with 
an illegal status. In American case law,237 this position was also adopted with respect to 18 
USC par. 1589 ‘forced labour’: illegal aliens should be regarded as a particularly vulnerable 
group.238

Exploitation
In the EU Framework Decision and the Palermo Protocol, exploitation is specified as encom-
passing forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, and servitude. The 
four American provisions on economic exploitation express these specifications in terms of

238 In fact, it is also regarded as an aggravating factor in the US when a vulnerable person is affected by a crime. 
The question can the arise whether the involvement of a vulnerable victim of human trafficking can have a 
general effect of increasing a sentence since it is already more or less discounted in (the nature of) the offence 
and the maximum sentence. The court in the Calimlin case decided that this question should be answered 
objectively rather than subjectively, since if a victim belongs to a group of people who are in general vulner-
able to becoming victims of human trafficking, the American courts must discount the relevant aggravating 
circumstance in the sentence, regardless of whether the victim can also be regarded (on the grounds of the 
nature of the victim) as particularly vulnerable. In this case, the victim was a member of the group illegal 
aliens, who are often victims of human trafficking. Purely on those grounds, they must be regarded as vul-
nerable victims. USA v. Elnora M. Calimlin en Jefferson N. Calimlin, US Court of Appeals, seventh circuit, Nos.

intent, specifically for the purpose of ‘forced labour’, ‘involuntary servitude’, ‘peonage’ and 
‘slavery’. Loosely translated, it seems possible to conclude from the history of the American 
legislation that the provision on ‘involuntary servitude’ is deemed to cover the most serious 
cases of human trafficking.239 Victims of less serious cases – but still cases that involve, at the 
least, ‘severe forms of worker exploitation’ – are protected by the ‘forced labour’ provision 
(18 USC par. 1589), the lower limit of which forms the boundary between criminal law and 
labour law.240 In a nutshell, in the American situation there is a division between criminal 
exploitation of labour (18 USC par. 1581, 1583, 1584, 1589) on the one hand, and human traf-
ficking per se for the purpose of criminal exploitation of labour, on the other (18 USC par. 
1590). The decisive factors in American case law are still only (1) whether the employer got 
the employee to perform work or services, (2) by applying one of the means of persuasion or 
coercion specified in the various human trafficking provisions of the USC and (3) whether 
the employer did so ‘knowingly’. In contrast to the Dutch courts, with the exception of the 
American appeal case Bradley and O’Dell,241 the American courts do not seem to have gone 
on to enquire whether there was an excessive situation or such a violation of fundamental 
human rights that one could speak of exploitation. Very probably this was connected with 
the evidence in the relevant cases.

In Belgian legislation, exploitation is defined as a violation of human dignity. The legislation 
and case law that were studied in Belgium seem to show that exploitation or a violation of hu-
man dignity require that the offender profited or wanted to profit from the human traffick-
ing activity. Such an intention to profit is manifested by circumstances relating to the work, 
the living environment and the wage, but not solely illegal work or illegal employment.242 
For example, a wage that is manifestly not in proportion to the very large number of hours 
worked, possibly without a day off, or the provision of unpaid services, are described as 
working condition that are in violation of human dignity.243 The absence of a clear legal defi-

239 It is now clear from American case law that ‘peonage’ is seen in American legal practice as an element of 
‘involuntary servitude’. Taylor v. State of Ga. US Ga, 1942, 62 S.Ct. 415, 315, US 25, 86 L.Ed. 615. In fact, every 
case that has been prosecuted as a ‘peonage’ case could also have been brought for ‘involuntary servitude’.

243 The wage that is lower than the average monthly minimum income, as referred to in a collective labour 
agreement concluded in the Belgian National Labour Council, can be an incontrovertible indication of eco-
nomic exploitation for the fact-finding judge. There can also be working conditions that are not compatible 
with the standards laid down in the law of 4 August 1996 on the welfare of workers in the performance of 
their work. Depending on the specific circumstances of the case, the fact-finding judge has to decide on the 
existence of this element. See the explanatory memorandum to the proposal for a law to amend various 
provisions with a view to strengthening efforts to tackle human trafficking and people smuggling, Parl. St.,

nition of precisely what is meant by human dignity could give judges too wide a margin for 
interpretation; the term could be construed in different ways, which could again ultimately 
lead to evidentiary problems.244 On the other hand, the advantage of the broad definition 
is that it can cover various forms of exploitation. In Belgium, it is often the working condi-
tion linked to the conditions under which workers are housed that are decisive for deciding 
whether there was human trafficking,245 as the following case shows.

Exploitation in terrace building246

Two suspects with Belgian nationality were suspected of exploiting workers, mainly Bulgar-
ians. The East European victims worked for a company that built terraces and driveways and 
installed fences. The employees were paid €5 to €6 an hour, worked 10 to 12 hours a day and 
lived in caravans on site, but €50 to €70 a month was withheld for accommodation, water and 
electricity.

The Correctional Court in Bruges ruled that ‘intended or actual exploitation’ in the final para-
graph of Article 433quinquies (1) of the Belgian Criminal Code meant that a person intended 
to profit or did profit from the human trafficking activity. The profit or intention to profit was 
manifested in this case by the low wages, long working hours and poor accommodation. The 
conditions under which the illegal workers were actually employed, their accommodation and 
the long hours worked by these persons demonstrated that the suspects abused the ‘precarious 
situation’ – as defined in Article 433septies (2) of the Belgian Criminal Code – in which these 
persons found themselves. The hourly wage paid was significantly lower than the minimum 
hourly wage in the sector. Nevertheless, clients were billed four times the net amount paid to 
the workers.
The court found the defendants guilty under Article 433quinquies (1)(3), with the aggravating 
circumstances under Article 433septies (2) and (6) of the Belgian Criminal Code. The two de-
fendants were sentenced to prison terms of 18 months and 12 months, respectively. Both were 
also fined €1,000. The court noted that the suspects had acted purely and solely with the intent 
of earning money without concern for the living conditions of the illegal employees.

If the victim does not have the freedom or does not reasonably feel that he or she has the 
freedom to escape from the working situation, this can constitute exploitation under Dutch 
law. This is the case even if withdrawal is, in practice, possible, but the victim’s subjective ap-
praisal forms an obstacle to doing so.NRM5 In one case known to BNRM, an American court 
considered the argument put forward by the defence that the employees were not forced to 
continue working and that they could have fled to escape it. The court rejected this defence 
with the finding that the point was whether the person in question could reasonably believe 
that there was compulsion to continue working.

Possibility to escape the situation247

In this case the prosecution put forward the following reasoning: “The fact that [the victim] may 
have had an opportunity to escape is irrelevant if the defendants, using one or more of the prohibited 
means discussed earlier, made Martinez reasonably believe that she could not leave or that she would 
suffer serious harm if she did so. A victim who reasonably believes she cannot leave is under no af-
firmative duty to try to escape.” The court rejected the suspect’s defence that the employees were 
not forced to continue working and that they could have fled with the finding that the point was 
whether the person in question could reasonably believe that there was compulsion to continue 
working. According to the court, that was the case here.
An important issue in the Bradley and O’Dell case was the following instruction given by the 
judge to the jury: “[…] that government need not prove physical restraint, such as the use of chains, 
barbed wire, or locked doors to establish the offense of forced labor; and the fact that the victim may 
have had the opportunity to flee is not determinative of the offense of forced labor if the defendants 
placed the victim in such fear or circumstances that he did not reasonably believe he could leave”.248

In a number of Dutch judgments, the court ruled that it could not be established that the 
employees had no reasonable choice but to work for the suspects, or that they were free to 
leave.249 Belgian and Norwegian judges seem to assume more readily than the Dutch courts 
that victims have no realistic alternative than to submit to the human traffickers.250 For exam-
ple, a Norwegian court argued that if a person is actually being exploited it does not matter 
how he or she found himself in that situation and any consent to it is irrelevant. The victim’s 
consent can be annulled by the abuse of his or her vulnerable position. In deciding whether 
the person is in such a position, according to the Norwegian court, the victim’s situation 
before the exploitation is relevant, but it is also possible to consider the victim’s situation at 
the time of the exploitation.

Exploitation of Travellers251

On 4 July 2008, the first judgment in a case involving other forms of exploitation was rendered 
in Norway. Both the suspects and the individuals who worked for them were British and be-
longed to the ‘Travellers’ community. Travellers come originally from Ireland, lead a wander-
ing existence and often work in the informal economy. The suspects recruited young people 
– one of whom was underage – from the street. The young people had problems and some were 
scarcely able to look after themselves because they had been banished from their homes and 
because of unemployment, homelessness and health problems. They agreed to the proposed 
work, laying asphalt and tiles for private individuals, first in the United Kingdom and later in

Norway and Sweden. The suspects paid their journey and housed the four to six employees in 
a single caravan. They worked 12 hours a day, six days a week. Most of the victims earned the 
equivalent of €11 plus board and lodging a day. On Sundays and days when there was no work 
they went from door to door looking for work. Although witnesses made different statements 
on the subject, the court found it credible that the suspects had used physical violence or the 
threat of violence against the victims.252

The court ruled that in this case the consent of the victims was annulled by the abuse of their 
vulnerable position. The court then stated that “[…] merely the conditions of work that the 
accused has admitted mean that there exists an ‘exploitation’, and key topics in any evaluation 
of whether this occurred in abuse of a vulnerable situation or not will be what their life situa-
tion was prior to the exploitation, and the situation in which they were exploited”. The living 
conditions of the victims before the exploitation were such that there was abuse of a vulnerable 
situation in this case. The victims were homeless at the time and their only income was social 
security benefits. Several of the victims also had serious personal problems. The victims ap-
peared to the judges to be ‘young people who were hardly able to look after themselves’. Dur-
ing the exploitation, the abuse of the victims’ vulnerable situation was shown by the low wages, 
the violence and threats, the long working days and the poor living conditions, including that 
fact that they were repeatedly moved to different places. Although they did not lack food and 
clothing, there was exploitation in this case by means of abuse of a vulnerable situation.

Another point, according to the court, is whether the victims ‘have been subjected to forced 
labour’. The court interpreted ‘forced labour’ as work that a person does not start voluntarily 
and/or cannot withdraw from. The court found this latter aspect had been proved in this case, 
partly because of the victims’ multiple dependency on the suspects,253 the threat of violence if 
they were to run away and their lack of money. Given the situation in which the victims found 
themselves during the exploitation, they could not stop voluntarily. Under those conditions, 
they were therefore subject to forced labour.

The suspect received a prison sentence of 18 months, with deduction of the time spent on re-
mand.254 The perpetrator had to pay each of the victims just over €1,100 for emotional injury. 
In establishing the amount of compensation, the court took into account the conditions under 
which the victims were living before the exploitation. The profits were also confiscated and a 
car was seized by the government.

Nature of the work
As mentioned in §12.6.1, the Dutch courts have not yet ruled on a situation in which a person 
is induced by means of coercion to make him or herself available to perform sexual acts with 
only the suspect as a form of human trafficking. In Belgium, the Centre for Equal Oppor-

252 The judgment states that two victims who cooperated with the investigation and prosecution received police 
protection. The district court found that there was no proof of death threats being made by the suspects.

253 A relationship of multiple dependency arose because the victims were at an unknown location in a strange 
country and found it difficult to make themselves understood, among other things. The victims depended on 
the suspects for food and shelter. Only one victim had a valid passport. 

254 The suspect had been in provisional custody for seven months. The court suggested that there were also pu-
nitive aspects to the fact that the suspect had no contact with the outside world during his period in custody, 
apart from a monthly telephone call with his wife, who gave birth during the period he was on remand. The 
suspect was also an English-speaking illiterate, so the time he spent in provisional custody was described as 
unusually difficult for him.

534

tunities and Anti-racism (CGKR), which publishes an annual report on human trafficking, 
prompted a discussion of this topic. In its annual report for 2007, the CGKR said that under 
the old human trafficking provision, Article 77bis of the Aliens Act, the court based their 
central analysis on abuse of a precarious situation. Situations involving sexual slavery out-
side the context of prostitution could also fall under this broad definition. In the new human 
trafficking provision, Article 433quinquies of the Belgian Criminal Code, sexual exploitation 
is confined to prostitution and child pornography. The CGKR gave the example of the fol-
lowing case.

Sexual acts with suspect255

In this case, there was said to be a network through which the suspect arranged for attractive 
young female and male workers to come to Belgium by offering the prospect of generous terms 
of employment. Once they arrived in Belgium, the young women had to work 14-hour days, 
sometimes without being paid and in atrocious accommodation. In addition, the young women 
had to satisfy the defendant’s numerous sexual demands.

The district court and the appeal court found that human trafficking for the purpose of econom-
ic exploitation and rape had been proved but that sexual exploitation had not been proved.

According to the CGKR, the court file clearly shows that the suspect also arranged for the 
young women to come in order to satisfy his sexual urges.256 Economic exploitation was 
therefore not the suspect’s sole intention. On the basis of this case – in which it acted as a 
civil party – the CGKR wondered whether the judgments would have been different if the 
definition of the offence of human trafficking had related to every form of sexual exploita-
tion and not just to exploitation in prostitution. The Dutch legislation (Article 273f (2) of 
the Dutch Criminal Code) in fact treats other forms of sexual exploitation, in addition to 
prostitution, as a form of exploitation. The question posed by the CGKR therefore does not 
seem to apply to the Dutch situation.

12.5 Conclusions

This section outlines areas where problems arise in the subjects discussed in (the Dutch ver-
sion of) this chapter and subjects that deserve special attention.

Identification and perception
Growing attention is being devoted to identifying other forms of exploitation. For example, 
the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment produced a fact sheet entitled ‘Labour and 
Exploitation’ to raise awareness among potential victims. However, although Dutch legisla-
tion makes no distinction between sexual and other forms of exploitation, in practice there

535

are differences in how they are identified, investigated, prosecuted and tried, mainly related 
to the perception and recognition of situations of other forms of exploitation. The impres-
sion is that other forms of exploitation are seen as ‘less serious’ than sexual exploitation. In 
principle, the seriousness of the exploitation does not depend on the sector in which it oc-
curs.

It also seems that the care for victims of other forms of exploitation creates or could create 
practical problems, especially since the numbers involves are sometimes substantial. Victims 
of other forms of exploitation are not always reported to CoMensha.

Other forms of exploitation obviously occur. There must therefore be an adequate response 
to excesses from the entire chain of relevant actors.

Investigation and prosecution
In practice, however, investigative agencies still know relatively little about the problem of 
other forms of exploitation. There is no clear picture of the scale of the problem, the condi-
tions under which people are forced to work and the extent to which criminal organisations 
are involved. Other forms of exploitation are described as a blank spot in the National Threat 
Assessment 2008. The relevant agencies (the Labour Inspectorate, SIOD, the various police 
forces) do not always exchange warnings of exploitation. The Labour Inspectorate only oc-
casionally reports signs to the SIOD. Furthermore, combinations of different signs of ex-
ploitation are not always recognised as potential instances of human trafficking. The circum-
stances are more usually regarded as a series of isolated instances of breaches of labour and 
administrative law. Because the various agencies fail to make the connection between all of 
the various events, either within the organisation itself or together with other agencies, they 
fail to see it as a possible case of exploitation.
The public prosecution service’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Of-
fences does not always pick up information from investigations or does not always conduct 
an investigation into human trafficking, despite the fact that the public prosecution service 
has made human trafficking a priority. The failure to act on signals is also connected with 
the fact that the scope of exploitation has not yet been clearly defined in jurisprudence. This 
makes it difficult for investigative services and the public prosecution service to estimate 
which situations the courts will regard as human trafficking.
To stimulate an integrated approach towards other forms of exploitation, the public pros-
ecution service has started a pilot project with the police in the Zuid-Holland-Zuid region.
Training courses in human trafficking have been provided for employees of various depart-
ments in the Labour Inspectorate. The SIOD has made the fight against other forms of ex-
ploitation a priority and it recently produced an internal programme entitled ‘Programme to 
strengthen the approach to human trafficking’.
Certification of SIOD investigators had not yet been introduced when this report was writ-
ten. The division of the Labour Inspectorate devoted to working conditions has also not yet 
had any human trafficking training even though poor working conditions can be a sign of

536

human trafficking. On the other hand, WAV inspectors and AMF inspectors have received 
training in human trafficking.

Text of the law
Not for the first time has the question has arisen of whether the text of Article 273f Dutch 
Criminal Code should be amended to clarify the scope of other forms of exploitation. The 
text of the law is certainly not straightforward. This is due, among other things, to the fact 
that the text is taken almost verbatim from international provisions. The explanatory memo-
randum to article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code provides little help for the courts, to 
whom the further interpretation has consciously been left. Studying the legislation and case 
law in a number of other countries shows that the legal practice in those countries faces simi-
lar problems, while their legislation, although always based on the Palermo Protocol, differs 
in certain respects. Countries in which other forms of exploitation have long been punish-
able (such as Belgium and the US) have meanwhile gained a lot of experience in prosecuting 
these forms of human trafficking. Judges in the Netherlands could perhaps learn from simi-
lar cases abroad. An international databank of judicial rulings might be a solution. Amend-
ing the act would not solve the problems relating to the interpretation and recognition of 
what constitutes other forms of exploitation.

Case law
Although the scope of the offence of human trafficking in the sense of other forms of ex-
ploitation has not yet been clearly defined in case-law, a number of trends have emerged in 
the jurisprudence. Three of the 12 cases of other forms of exploitation to date have led to 
convictions for human trafficking. In the judgments studied, the finding of fact failed most 
often on the elements of exploitation or the intention of exploitation and the coercive instru-
ment ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’. It is possible that the workplace (behind the front door 
or at a business location that is part of the formal economy) and the commercial nature of 
the relationship between the perpetrator and victim influences where the judge draws the 
line between poor employment practices and exploitation. It is also possible that convinc-
ing evidence of exploitation is easier to supply if the victim’s physical integrity is violated by 
physical violence than by, for example, physically harmful work or an exhausting working 
regime.
As regards the criterion that the victim does not or does not reasonably feel that he or she 
is free to escape from the labour situation, the subjective perception of a lack of liberty has 
raised complications in a number of judgments. Courts still seem to deal differently with 
the question of whether the worker had a reasonable alternative to becoming involved in the 
situation of exploitation. In other countries the judge seems to be more willing to assume 
that the victim had no real alternative than to work for the exploiter.
In four of the 12 cases studied in the Netherlands the victims/employees were involved in 
criminal offences closely related to the situation of exploitation. In two of these cases, the 
victims were prosecuted for them. This fact is interesting in the context of the possibilities 

NMR Ch12.indd   536 09-06-10   00:12



Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

537

provided by the non-punishment principle (see Chapter 6). In the two judgments that lead to 
acquittal on charges of human trafficking, the court, in finding that that there was no ques-
tion of exploitation, did mention the criminal nature of the work, but the judgment did not 
show that the court had attached any weight to the fact that the work the workers had to 
perform was punishable.
In half of the cases that were examined, according to the indictment sexual services were 
also performed by the employees/victims. One case involved sexual services with a third 
party for payment; in the five other cases, the employees/victims were sexually abused by the 
defendants themselves. The question that arises is whether providing sexual services for a 
single person under compulsion, outside the sex industry, can fall within the scope of article 
273f of the Dutch Criminal Code. No court has yet ruled on this issue. A similar discussion 
has arisen in Belgium.
Practice also seems to confirm that there is an increased risk of exploitation in certain forms 
of ethnic entrepreneurship and that exploitation also occurs within relationships and/or 
families. There is little certainty about the extent to which cultural background can be taken 
into account in a judgment in a case involving other forms of exploitation.

Risk sectors and risk groups
Several groups at risk of other forms of exploitation are discussed in Chapter 12. What 
stands out is that people from Central and Eastern European countries and people living il-
legally in the Netherlands often work through mala fide employment agencies, which makes 
them vulnerable to exploitation. Although certified employment agencies are guilty of fewer 
abuses than non-certified companies, the percentage is still relatively high. This is therefore 
another area of concern.
Domestic staff employed by diplomats face an additional risk of exposure to exploitation be-
cause the immunity of diplomats complicates prosecution in the event of abuses. The Minis-
try of Foreign Affairs has taken various steps to improve the position of the domestic staff of 
diplomats. For example, domestic workers are given instructions, which include pointers on 
human trafficking. However, the instructions are given verbally; there is no written informa-
tion, such as the telephone numbers of organisations that can help victims of human traffick-
ing, the police or the ministry. This make is it more difficult for a domestic worker to contact 
the appropriate agencies if he or she experiences a situation of exploitation.
Exploitation within marriage is another area of attention. There are no details available on 
the nature and scale of it.

Human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal 

13.1 Introduction

The topic of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal was addressed in NRM5. 
This examination was prompted by the fact that as of 1 January 2005, Section 273f of the 
Dutch Criminal Code can also be applied to human trafficking for the purpose of organ re-
moval. In the case of human trafficking with regard to organs, the description of the offence 
not only includes the removal of organs, but also for example the arranging and/or brokering 
of international travel for the purposes of illegally removing an organ and the recruitment 
and/or misleading of donors.1

The exploration of the topic in NRM5 consisted of two surveys. The first involved a litera-
ture study on the legal framework for organ transplants in the Netherlands, the international 
organ trade, the question of whether Dutch people are involved in this and the ethical debate 
on the different ways in which organs are available for transplant. 
The second survey, among transplant surgeons and coordinators, was focused on the ques-
tion of whether there were Dutch kidney patients in the Netherlands who had wanted to, 
tried to or did in fact purchase a transplant kidney in the Netherlands or abroad. The findings 
indicated that organs were not being traded in the Netherlands but that greater vigilance is 
needed on this topic. Medical tourism and organ tourism may be more common in the Neth-
erlands than previously assumed. 

Delineation of terms
There have been various indications in the past year that Dutch (kidney) patients may be 
making use of the commercial trade in organs inside and outside the Netherlands. As argued 
in NRM5, organ trade is not the same as human trafficking but can, in practice, coincide with 
it within the same body of facts. It is also indicated in NRM5 that insurance companies’ ex-
periences with organ tourism by Dutch kidney patients have not yet been investigated. The 
emphasis of this chapter is therefore not only on human trafficking and organ trade, but also 
on organ tourism and the Dutch insurance system. Since the organ trade or certain forms 
thereof primarily concern kidney donation, the emphasis of this chapter is on these organs

are indications that in the past, organs of executed prisoners in China were sold without 
the permission of the deceased or their relatives by (individuals within) the Chinese govern-
ment.2 The Chinese government recently acknowledged that most donor organs in China 
come from prisoners sentenced to death.3

The question arises however of whether these cases also involve human trafficking for the 
purpose of organ removal. Under Dutch law, that is not the case if the people have already 
died.NRM5 Post-mortem organ removal is a violation of Section 9 of the Organ Donation Act 
(WOD) and Section 80 of the Burial and Cremation Act, if and insofar as no declaration of 
intent from the donor is available.

Working definitions used in this chapter
 – Commercial organ donation (‘transplant commercialism’)*: policy or practice whereby or-

gans are seen as a marketable good, which includes the sale and purchase for any material 
gain.

 – Medical tourism: travelling abroad to receive an organ for implant there without material 
gain.

 – Human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal**: using certain (coercive) means to re-
cruit, transport or house another with the aim of removing that person’s organs or having 
them removed.

 – Organ**: component of the human body or human foetus with the exception of blood or 
reproductive cells.

 – Organ trade**: the offering for sale and actual sale of an organ, the purchase of an organ and 
the brokering and/or deliberate transplant of a traded organ for profit, between buyer and 
seller.

 – Organ tourism (‘transplant tourism’)*: travelling abroad to receive an organ for implant there 
whereby organ trading and/or commercial organ donation is made use of, or when use of the 
resources (organs, professional healthcare providers and transplant centres) for the trans-
plant to the foreign patient undermines the capacity of the country in question to provide 
transplant services to its own population. 

2 Shimazono (2007) cites a 2005 study which states that a Chinese medical centre performed 450 kidney and 
liver transplants for non-Chinese patients from 19 countries. According to the official country report on 
China from the Department for the movement of persons, migration and alien affairs, asylum and migra-
tion affairs division on 24 March 2009, p. 59 and Huang et al., 2008, p. 1938, in 2007 China adopted the 
Regulation on Human Organ Transplantation which states that organ donors, even executed prisoners, must 
explicitly give permission for organ removal. There are indications however that such illegal practices con-
tinue. Matas & Kilgour, 2007, talk about deliberate government policy whereby organs are purchased from 
executed prisoners. Special prisoners are also reportedly selected for this, with a view to removing organs. 
Such cases can be said to involve human trafficking.

geëxecuteerden toe], Het Parool, 27 August 2009; “China to fit abuses in organ donation” [China gaat mis-

 – Organ transplant**: the complete process starting from the preparations for the surgical 
transfer of an organ from one person to another, including the preservation and storage of 
the organ in the interim.

*  Based on the Draft glossary on donation and transplantation from the World Health Organi-
sation4 

**  According to NRM5

Recent scientific and normative literature from the 2007-2009 period is discussed in §13.2. 
Findings from qualitative and quantitative studies on the nature and scope of the interna-
tional organ trade are described in §13.2.1. The empirical research into these organ trans-
plants sketches out a picture of organ donors from underdeveloped countries who surrender 
a kidney for financial reasons to wealthy patients needing organs. §13.2.2 briefly describes, 
from a normative perspective, a few new contributions to the ethical discussion on the per-
missibility of different forms of organ donation. 

The relevance for the Netherlands of the ethical discussion on the permissibility of different 
forms of organ donation emerges from the case described in §13.3. In 2007 a Dutch insur-
ance company reimbursed a Dutch woman who underwent a kidney transplant in Pakistan. 
At the time Dutch politicians raised the question of whether this kind of development was 
desirable. In §13.3.1 the role played by the Dutch insurance system in reimbursing the costs 
of organ donation procedures abroad and the corresponding legislation is discussed. At the 
root of the international organ trade (as well as organ tourism) and human trafficking for the 
purpose of organ removal is the shortage of organ donors. §13.3.2 discusses in more detail 
the government’s approach to reducing this shortage. 
The last subsection (§13.3.3) shows that, in addition to the Pakistan case above, there were 
two other signals that failed to provide points of departure for further investigation in rela-
tion to human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. There are also more concrete 
indications that the (international) organ trade is occurring on a limited scale in the Nether-
lands. Vigilance is advised therefore: the organ trade in the Netherlands could take off, pos-
sibly accompanied by cases of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, since the 
shortage of suitable donors is still pressing. 

The fact that Dutch health insurers are bound by various European and international trea-
ties with regard to reimbursing the costs of organ transplant procedures abroad is discussed 
in §13.3. Not only do such documents have an effect on national jurisdictions, the empirical 
findings and normative standpoints cited earlier have also had repercussions on (recent) in-

ternational regulations from various organisations. §13.4 contains a very brief description 
of the European and international legal framework concerning the organ trade and human 
trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. 

13.2 Empirical and normative framework

The results of qualitative and quantitative studies into the effects of organ tourism on the 
organ provider in organ-exporting countries are first discussed. These findings may help 
determine a standpoint on the permissibility of organ tourism. Although there is consen-
sus on the criminalisation of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, this and 
other forms of organ trade are the subject of discussion. Since NRM5 already addressed the 
medical-ethical discussion on commercial organ transplants, this section does not touch on 
the various perspectives again, but does address the contributions published between the 
years 2007-2009. 

13.2.1 Empirical research

Little empirical research has been conducted into the organ trade and human trafficking for 
the purpose of organ removal. The available results indicate that the circumstances in which 
organ donations occur in certain countries point to forms of organ trade and possibly even 
human trafficking. 

Commissioned by the World Health Organisation, Shimazono (2007) conducted a litera-
ture study in which he brought together the qualitative and quantitative data from available 
studies on organ trade. The scope and consequences of the international trade in organ-im-
porting5 and organ-exporting6 countries were described on the basis of 51 scientific articles 
and 243 media reports.7 As such, Shimazono’s study is the only summarising report with 
such an extent of information on the organ trade and human trafficking for the purpose of 
organ removal.8 

5 Shimazono cites countries such as Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United 
States as examples. 

6 Organ-exporting countries are, for example, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, the Philippines, India, Iraq, 
Iran, Israel, Moldavia, Pakistan, Peru and Turkey.

7 Fifteen ‘other’ documents are also used, according to Shimazono. The nature of these is unknown.
8 The Council of Europe is currently conducting a multidisciplinary international study into organ trade and 

human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, see the Council of Europe’s Action to combat traffick-
ing in human beings, CM/Inf(2008)28, 9 June 2008. This study from the Council of Europe had not yet 
been published when this report was written. In addition, the European Parliament states that Europol has 
not carried out any study into organ sale and organ trade because it argues that there are no cases that can 
be supported with documentary evidence. The European Parliament countered this by stating that docu-
ments show that organ trade is indeed a problem for EU member states. See: Resolution of the European 
Parliament of 22 April 2008, Organ donation and transplantation: policy measures on the EU level, P6_
TA(2008)0130.

Scope and forms of organ tourism
Although qualitative studies on the scope of the organ trade are still very scarce, Shimazono 
estimates the number of kidney transplants as a result of organ trade and human trafficking 
at five percent of the total number of live kidney transplants performed worldwide.
Shimazono distinguishes four forms of international organ trade, which also includes organ 
tourism (see Figure 13.1).

Figure 13.1 In mode 1 a recipient travels from country B to country A where the donor and the transplant 
centre are located. In mode 2 the donor from country A travels to the recipient and transplant centre in B. 
Mode 3 is the situation in which the recipient and the donor travel from country A to the transplant centre in 
country B. In mode 4 the donor travels from country A and the recipient from country B to the transplant 
centre in country C.

Consequences of organ tourism for donor and recipient
Shimazono also looked at the effects and consequences of undergoing an organ transplant in 
organ-exporting countries. Based on thirteen studies, he concluded that the recipient runs a 
heightened risk of medical complications. The chance of survival and the body’s acceptance 
of the new organ are also substantially lower than prescribed by internationally accepted 
standards. 
In response to the three quantitative studies, Shimazono wrote about the economic and 
medical consequences that the organ trade has for the paid kidney donors in the organ-ex-
porting countries of Egypt, India and Iran. He revealed that poverty is usually an economic 
motive for paid donors to surrender a kidney. The financial benefit from the organ donation 
proves to be short lived. In Egypt, 78% of the paid donors had spent the money received 
within five months after donation. 73% of them were unable to engage in as much labour-

544

intensive work. In India, families of paid kidney donors had a lower income in general. It also 
emerged that most donors (93%) had surrendered a kidney to pay a debt, but that 75% still 
had a debt after the donation. In Iran, 65% indicated that the organ donation had negative ef-
fects on (the practice of) their profession. In the three countries, a large majority of the paid 
donors reported that the organ donation had caused their health to deteriorate. Shimazono 
states that these findings are consistent with the results of qualitative studies carried out in 
other organ-exporting countries. Paid donors from these countries also indicated that they 
suffered from depression, regret and discrimination9. They also often had no access to medi-
cal after-care. A 2007 survey of kidney donors in Pakistan showed that 90% were illiterate 
and 70% performed debt labour. Respondents stated that paying off a debt was the most 
important motive for surrendering a kidney. For the rest, 88% of them reported that their 
financial situation did not improve after the kidney donation and regretted the decision to 
sell the organ.

The findings above relating to organ trade are in contrast to research by Zuidema10 into altru-
istic donors in the Netherlands. None of the altruistic kidney donors from the study experi-
enced medical or psychosocial complications of a permanent nature after the donation. Nor 
did any of them regret his decision after the fact.11 This is true both for persons who donated 
a kidney to someone they knew and for kidney donors who had never and would never meet 
the recipient of the organ.12 This conclusion is also supported by similar research among 
5,000 altruistic kidney donors who in fact indicated they had experienced an improvement 
to their self confidence, relationship and quality of life after the donation.13 

9 Shimazono does not elaborate on where this discrimination in relation to paid kidney donation originates 
from or how it is expressed.

10 Zuidema et al., 2009.
11 Reasons cited for donors to surrender a kidney include the fact that some altruistic donors know patients in 

their immediate or broader environment who have a kidney disease or must undergo dialysis. Others indi-
cated that they knew seriously ill (kidney) patients (who they were unable to help).

12 Zuidema et al., 2009, describes five ways in which live kidney donation takes place at the Erasmus Medical 
Centre in Rotterdam. Good Samaritan kidney donation: live donation of a kidney to an unknown recipient 
(non-directed altruistic donation). Non-directed donation: a living donor anonymously donates a kidney to 
a recipient on the waiting list; directed donation: a living donor donates a kidney to an acquaintance with 
whom he or she does not have any particular emotional or family relationship (at the Erasmus Medical Cen-
tre, Good Samaritan donors can also opt for this directed form of donation); Donor-exchange programme: 
couples where one partner is not compatible with the other for the purposes of donation exchange a donor 
kidney with another couple; Domino couple-exchange programmes: a Good Samaritan donor gives a kidney 
to a recipient of an exchange couple that could not find a suitable donor in the exchange programme, and the 
donor from this couple, who has already indicated they are willing to donate, gives a kidney to a patient on 
the waiting list.

13.2.2 Ethical discussion

Although there is consensus in the scientific debate on the impermissibility of human traf-
ficking for the purpose of organ removal, the ethical discussion on the (international) organ 
trade and organ tourism continues. Few insights have been added in relation to this topic 
since NRM5. Various authors for instance, who are also cited in NRM5, state in new ar-
ticles that organ trade and organ tourism are equivalent to human trafficking for the pur-
pose of organ removal. It is notable striking in this discussion that a number of the authors 
who became involved in the ethical discussion serve (together) at regulatory organisations 
or organisations with an important advisory function. As such, the current debate on the 
international level (2007-2009) is not characterised by a variety of innovative opinions or 
perspectives.

Impermissibility of organ tourism
The empirical research results discussed in §13.2.1 are regularly used to argue in support of 
the assertion that organ tourism is usually a form of human trafficking. 
The worldwide shortage of available organs from altruistic donors is seen as the root cause 
of the organ trade and organ tourism. Consequently, people with a weak socioeconomic sta-
tus in organ-exporting countries are exploited since patients want to evade waiting lists for 
organ transplants in their own (organ-importing) countries.14 It is concluded that the organ 
provider’s social determinants – poverty, debts, a vulnerable social position or illiteracy – are 
a reflection of social inequality between the donor and recipient and compel the donor to sell 
an organ.15 Because of these determinants, there is no autonomy or freedom of choice for 
the organ provider. For this reason it is claimed that there is usually a case of coercion and 
exploitation.16 
Various experts also indicate that regulations are sidestepped or violated in both organ-ex-
porting and organ-importing countries in the event of organ tourism.17 There are indications 
that organised crime plays a role in the worldwide trade in organs.18 
There are also a number of practical objections to the organ trade for the organ recipient. 
This can include the lack of essential donor information from the organ provider and an 
impairment of the usual doctor-patient relationship.19

Criticism
Evans20 believes that one should be cautious in taking a definitive position concerning organ 
tourism as a form of human trafficking. Although Evans subscribes to the practical objec-
tions and empirical studies that point to exploitation and coercion, he claims that many argu-
ments against organ trade are ethnocentric and only represent a Western view. Evans warns 
that such an approach will not solve the actual problem – the shortage of altruistic organ 
donors – but only contribute to worsening diplomatic relations between countries. 
What is striking about this assertion is that in the 2007-2009 period at least, a number of 
organ-exporting countries (China21, the Philippines22 and Pakistan23) took measures to coun-
ter organ tourism, while in various organ-importing countries like Israel24, Singapore25 and 
the United States26 voices are being heard and/or regulations have been introduced to allow 
forms of commercial organ transplant.27

In the Netherlands too there are proponents of financial incentives for donation by live do-
nors. The Council for Public Health and Care (RVZ) stated in 2007 that altruism and pay-
ment can go hand in hand.28 The Council claimed that a concrete reward could give this form 
of donation a significant boost. A life-long exemption from paying health insurance premi-
ums would in that case be the most suitable form of reward. According to the RVZ, there is 
less of a risk that someone would donate an organ in order to get money if the reward is free 
health insurance. The Association of Dutch Health Insurers is adverse to this however, since 
it could appeal to people in financial need.29

13.3 Developments in the Netherlands

It is concluded in NRM5 that there are currently few indications that organ trade or hu-
man trafficking for the purpose of organ removal occurs in the Netherlands. The report 
did warn about the possible increase in organ tourism by Dutch patients and the need for 
vigilance with regard to any donations that may not be entirely voluntary and donations in 
exchange for financial compensation at Dutch transplant centres.NRM5 A number of develop-
ments have taken place in the Netherlands since that report which support these points for 
concern.
Following a case in which a Dutch kidney patient travelled to Pakistan for a transplant, it is 
becoming clear what role the government allocates the Dutch insurance system with regard 
to combating and preventing organ tourism. In §13.3.1, relevant developments with regard to 
regulation in this area are discussed. 
The Master plan for Organ Donation is then discussed in §13.3.2. In this subsection the gov-
ernment’s angle of approach and action plan to reduce the shortage in organ donations is 
discussed. The relevance of this for human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal is 
clear from the rationale behind the penalty provision of the relevant Organ Donation Act 
– to combat commercial transplant practices. After all, commercialisation can result in in-
voluntary removals.NRM5

In §13.3.3, incidents of international organ trade and human trafficking for the purpose of or-
gan removal in the Netherlands and the responses to these from the police and public pros-
ecution service are described.

13.3.1 Insurance system in the Pakistan case

The RVZ report above and the response to this from the Association of Dutch Health Insur-
ers demonstrate that the discussion on commercial organ transplants is a topical one in the 
Netherlands as well. In its broadcast on 21 January 2008, television programme Netwerk 
showed a case of organ tourism in which a Dutch kidney patient underwent a transplant in 
Pakistan. A Dutch health insurer had reimbursed the patient the costs of the kidney trans-
plant. The research from Shimazono showed that in Pakistan, these kinds of transplants can 
involve organ trade. There have also been incidents in this country known to involve human 
trafficking for the purpose of organ removal.30 
Members of parliament posed questions in response to the broadcast to Minister Klink of 
Public Health, Welfare and Sport on the permissibility of a kidney transplant in Pakistan and 
reimbursement by a health insurer of the costs of such a transplant.31 In his answers to these 
parliamentary questions, the minister reported that under the Healthcare Insurance Act the

health insurer is not required to investigate whether the donor was paid more for the organ 
than the income lost as a result of the operation. Nor did the information at hand provide 
sufficient indications to conclude that the case involved a criminal offence under Dutch law. 
The permission to remove organs in exchange for payment is void in the Netherlands on 
grounds of Section 2 of the Organ Donation Act. 

Punishability of (international) organ trade
Section 32 of the Organ Donation Act is relevant for the punishability of organ trade in the 
Netherlands and by Dutch persons abroad. The following actions are made punishable of-
fences in this section:

 – intentionally causing or facilitating a person to grant a third party permission to remove 
an organ while the donor is alive in exchange for payment that exceeds the costs, includ-
ing lost income, that are a direct consequence of the removal of an organ (a commercial 
compensation); 

 – the public offering of compensation for an organ that amounts to more than the costs, 
including lost income, that are a direct result of the removal of an organ (a commercial 
compensation).32 

In this case the circumstances in which the donor surrendered his kidney are not known. As 
a result it is not clear whether the kidney patient’s action has criminal law consequences in 
the Netherlands. The patient had paid the compensation to the Pakistani hospital and not 
the kidney donor. As such there was no direct connection between the contested action (the 
payment of a kidney donor) and the performance that arose from the health insurance agree-
ment (the reimbursement of the costs of the kidney transplant).

With regard to the payment of the health insurer’s compensation to the kidney patient, 
the Healthcare Insurance Act stipulates that a compensation must be paid out regardless 
of whether the organ was paid for or not. The minister stated that “a kidney transplant is 
covered by health insurance if the insured person needs this transplant and this transplant 
is performed in a medically responsible manner. This does not alter the fact that [the health 
insurer] could have refused to reimburse the costs on grounds of the Civil Code by claiming 
that the compensation was unacceptable in accordance with the criteria of reasonableness 
and fairness or at odds with good morals or public order. In order to successfully appeal in 
court to these provisions of the Dutch Civil Code, the insurer has, in any event, in the context 
of its burden of proof, the difficult task of discussing the specific circumstances concerning 
the patient and his transplant in Pakistan.”

Healthcare Insurance Board 
The Healthcare Insurance Board had indicated to the relevant health insurer in a number of 
considerations33 concerning the reimbursement of the costs of the kidney transplant that it 
was possible for the health insurer to refuse to reimburse the costs of kidney transplants in 
Pakistan on grounds of the Civil Code.34 Section 3:40 of the Civil Code prescribes after all 
that a legal act that, by its substance or purport, is at odds with good morals or public order 
is void. The Board deemed that a situation in which kidneys donated in exchange for pay-
ment are used falls within the territory of good morals.35 The Board stated: “This applies all 
the more since in the Netherlands it is also at odds with the standards of the (written) law. 
This use of kidneys donated in exchange for payment regardless of where this took place can 
be at odds with good morals. The question here is whether payment to the donor under any 
circumstances can be considered at odds with good morals. If the agreement is reached with 
the full consent of the donor and in accordance with the laws of the relevant country, could 
that verdict be different from the verdict in cases where there is a case of pressure (such as 
coercion, violence, deceit or abuse of circumstances)? This verdict primarily relates however 
to the agreement with the donor, or the treatment agreement.”

The Board also concluded that “evident consent of the donor, if this is already presumed, 
[can] make it more difficult to decide that reimbursement of the transplant costs contravenes 
good morals”. Although organ trade in Pakistan was still legal in 2007 at the time of the inci-
dent36, the discussion seems relevant here as well whether one can speak of the exploitation 
and coercion of donors if they feel forced by miserable circumstances to surrender their kid-
ney. The Board stated that in such a consideration, the individual case must be examined and 
that this will not always result in the same outcome. The Board concluded with the statement 
that the health insurer had to make the decision independently in this case.

Healthcare Insurance Act
In the Parliamentary Document on Organ transplants abroad dated 3 November 2008, 
Minister Klink informed parliament that in consultation with the Minister of Justice he had 
decided to amend the Healthcare Insurance Act such that the insurer must refuse to reim-
burse costs of procedures if there is serious doubt about the ethical permissibility of the 
transplant.37 This legal measure will be taken on 1 January 2010, the minister said. Another 

33 The Board did not give the health insurer any advice, but instead shared a number of considerations, since 
it is not within its authority to answer the main question (Does a kidney transplant abroad fall within the 
coverage of a basic policy if a kidney donated in exchange for payment is used?). 

34 Healthcare Insurance Board AaZ, 1 October 2007. 
35 Good morals should regarded as the standards of unwritten law perceived as fundamental in a certain social 

constellation, whereby morality is central.
36 Organ transplants for foreigners have been banned since the introduction of the Transplantation of Human 

Organs and Human Tissue Ordinance 2007. This Pakistani law stipulates penalties and prison sentences for 
those who trade in organs or unlawfully remove them (according to the conditions that are set in the Trans-
plantation of Human Organs and Human Tissue Ordinance 2007).

change concerns the Healthcare Insurance Decree.38 This amendment means that a kidney 
transplant performed outside the EU or the countries that are party to the Agreement on 
the European Economic Area only falls within the insured performance of the Healthcare 
Insurance Act if the organ has been donated by a blood relative, spouse or registered part-
ner. According to Minister Klink, this could result in fewer people seeking refuge in buying 
a kidney.39

13.3.2 Master plan for Organ Donation

As described above, the enormous shortage of donors is at the root of the organ trade and hu-
man trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. This shortage is only expected to increase 
in the coming years.40 In order to respond to this, the Master plan for Organ Donation was 
set up in 2008 by the Organ Donation Coordination group.41 The Coordination group saw 
the low degree of registration in the system at the time as the root of the shortage of donors. 
For this reason, the options for financial incentives for live donation were investigated. This 
would result in limiting the prohibition on organ trade as described in the Organ Donation 
Act. The relevance of this for human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal is clear 
from the rationale behind the penalty provision of the WOD – to combat commercial trans-
plantation practices. After all, commercialisation can result in involuntary removals.42 NRM5

The Coordination group investigated the different aspects of and support among the Dutch 
population for various remuneration systems43 for live donation. It emerged from this that 
there is insufficient support among the population for the inclusion of financial incentives. 
Another finding was that financial incentives are both ethically and legally undesirable. The 
Coordination group stated that the appeal to the immaterial symbolic value of the integrity of 
the human body outweighs the material value and commercialisation of the body. The legiti-
macy for a doctor cooperating with a financially motivated organ donor would also lapse.44 
In addition to the foregoing ethical arguments, the legal latitude for most forms of financial 
incentives is also lacking, both on the national (WOD) and European level45.

Biomedicine of the Council of Europe (Treaty Series 1997, 113). See §13.3.2. In her policy letter on Ethics on 7 
September 2007, the State Secretary for Public Health, Welfare and Sport stated her intention to ratify the 
this convention in the near future. The convention in question had not yet been ratified when this report was 
written.

Human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal

The Coordination group concluded by stating that the financial encouragement of live dona-
tion must be rejected. It also concluded that by extension, live donation involving payment of 
the donor abroad is undesirable.46 
The government follows this line taken by the Coordination group in the Master plan.47

13.3.3 Incidents, investigation and prosecution

In its Instruction on Human Trafficking48 the public prosecution service states that illegal 
organ removal does not seem to occur in Western Europe. The literature study cited in the 
Instruction49 dates from 2004 and pertains to organ trade. With regard to organ trade, the 
researchers in question hardly found any reliable information that related concretely to the 
Netherlands. It was concluded that there mainly seemed to be a great many rumours.50

As indicated below, there are now indeed signs and indications of the existence of organ 
trade and organ tourism in the Netherlands.

Incidents
It emerges from the Pakistan case cited above that since NRM5, there has been at least one 
case known in which Dutch citizens took part in organ tourism. 
In 2009 it emerged that the organ trade might also be taking place in the Netherlands. The 
programme Undercover in Nederland showed that people would be willing to surrender a 
kidney in exchange for payment.51 In such cases the organ provider would pretend during 
the medical check-in procedures to be a friend of the recipient with an altruistic motive for 
enabling the transplant. 
There are also kidney patients in the Netherlands who place advertisements in hopes of find-
ing an altruistic live donor.52 Although legal,53 this example shows the desperation of patients 
and such advertisements may invite organ trade.

It is not only the media that play a role in detecting organ trade. Doctors, hospitals, municipal 
health authorities and the Public Health Inspectorate could also contribute to these efforts. 
The public prosecution service points out that such authorities and individuals may pick up 
on an indication, during a consultation with a patient or when examining or performing 
surgery on a patient, that the patient might be being coerced into allowing the removal of 
the organ. In such cases they should alert the patient to the possibility of filing a report and

the assistance that welfare services can provide. They too can file the report of ascertained 
abuses themselves.54

It is doubtful however whether Dutch doctors would file a report in the event of ascertained 
cases of organ tourism. They may have doubts about providing care to patients in the pe-
riod following the transplant abroad, but also in assessing whether the situation contravenes 
their own professional standards (and possibly Dutch law). There are indications that Dutch 
doctors are in fact confronted with organ tourism. From interviews with a surgeon, eight 
nephrologists and four transplant coordinators from the Netherlands it emerged that they 
knew a total of 27 people who had undergone a transplant in the past ten to fifteen years in 
organ-exporting countries like China, India, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan.55

Investigation
It is unknown whether human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal actually occurs 
in the Netherlands. BNRM received two signals from police in 2006 and 2007 concerning 
the possible involvement of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. The in-
formation available did not provide the responsible investigation services with any point of 
departure for further investigation. CoMensha also registered one possible case of human 
trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, in September 2007. This involved a man of 
Indian background who had told police that he was being forced to surrender a kidney. Ulti-
mately the man left the country for an unknown destination. 
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on a case that took place between Septem-
ber 2002 and October 2004. This case centred on a violation of Section 209a of the Czech 
Penal Code. This provision relates to the unauthorised treatment of human tissue and or-
gans of persons who are already deceased. The suspects in the matter were employees of the 
Czech tissue bank, who were in contact with an organised group from the Netherlands.56 

Public prosecution service
BNRM is not currently aware of any cases in which the public prosecution service started 
prosecution with regard to human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. In the In-
struction on Human Trafficking, the public prosecution service states that illegal organ re-
moval does not seem to occur in Western Europe.57 The Instruction deals very summarily 
with the removal of organs as a form of human trafficking. 

54 Instruction on Human Trafficking (2008A022), Government Gazette 2008, 235.
55 See Ambagtsheer, 2007. Many of the patients were born outside the Netherlands or had some other sort of 

foreign background. Ethnic networks and the internet played an important role in facilitating paid organ 
transplants abroad.

in the Czech Republic, 2009, p. 15. Incidentally it is not reported whether the suspects were in fact convicted 
under the relevant Section 209a of the Czech Penal Code. Nor is anything about the nature of the organised 
group mentioned.

13.4 International regulations

The relevant national legislation concerning organ trade and human trafficking for the pur-
pose of organ removal was described in NRM5. The report at hand also focused in the fore-
going sections on a number of recent changes to national regulations for combating organ 
tourism and organ trade. As indicated by the Master plan on Organ Donation, Dutch legisla-
tion is bound by a number of treaties on the European and international level. There are also 
various other (legally non-binding) directives and declarations drafted by organisations that 
work internationally with organ donation or to combat organ trade and human trafficking 
for the purpose of organ removal. 

In 2009 a study prepared jointly by the UN and the Council of Europe was published on 
the trade in organs and tissue, which includes human trafficking for the purpose of organ 
removal.58 This study gives an overview of the state of affairs, examines existing measures to 
combat organ trafficking and explores possible further steps to combat this phenomenon, 
including the possible establishment of new international regulations.59 For this reason the 
international legal framework is not described in detail here; for such a description, see the 
relevant study by the Council of Europe. 

Legal research by BNRM indicates that the call on governments to take measures to remedy 
the shortage of available organs and work away waiting lists for patients is a common theme 
throughout the European and international legal framework. Relevant European and inter-
national documents also state that human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal must 
be combated.
The European and international regulations differ in the extent of detail and on a number of 
definitions. The most far-reaching regulation from the Council of Europe60 for instance de-
clares that cell, tissue and organ donation may only take place on altruistic grounds, whereby 
any expenses must be reimbursed. In this context a decision to donate an organ must take 
place on the basis of informed consent and both the party providing the organ and the party 
receiving it must have access to all the necessary medical after-care. 
Differences can be found in the description of the human body parts to which the relevant 
regulations apply. The Declaration of Istanbul – drafted by The Transplant Society and the 
International Society of Nephrology – purely relates to (parts of) organs. The Council of Eu-

rope61 and the World Health Organisation62 also talk about human tissue and cells. Blood 
(and blood products) are not part of the definitions concerning organ trade and human traf-
ficking. This does not mean that such activities – blood trade63 and human trafficking for the 
purpose of removing blood (and blood products)64 – do not occur.

13.5 Conclusion

This section identifies where the bottlenecks with regard to the topics discussed in this chap-
ter are located and what topics in particular deserve attention.

The topic of organ trade generates interest in the Netherlands. The news media regularly de-
vote attention to it. It is an important point of concern internationally as well. There is hardly 
any information available on the actual occurrence of the phenomenon in the Netherlands. It 
was already noted in NRM5 that vigilance is necessary. This is still fully the case. 
There are for example indications that people travel from the Netherlands to organ-export-
ing countries. In order to detect possible abuses in the sphere of human trafficking, vigilance 
is necessary from facilitating, supporting and executive authorities in connection with organ 
donations, such as medical personnel and health insurers, concerning the origin of an organ 
in the event of, in particular, medical tourism. 
Further investigation into organ trade, organ tourism and human trafficking for the purpose 
of organ removal in the Netherlands may be able to offer support on this point. 

In her policy letter on Ethics on 7 September 2007, the State Secretary for Public Health, 
Welfare and Sport stated her intention to ratify the Convention on Human Rights and Bio-
medicine of the Council of Europe. That has not yet happened. 

61 The Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, on Transplantation of Organs and 
Tissues of Human Origin (2002) is a supplement to and specification of the general provisions of the Conven-
tion on Human Rights and Biomedicine. The term ‘tissue’ is made more explicit in this protocol and also 
includes human cells, but does not include blood (or blood products), foetuses or reproducible organs.

62 In the report Human Organ and Tissue Transplantation from 2009 the World Health Organisation presents 
new Guiding principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation. Guiding Principle 5 prescribes that 
cell, organ and tissue donation may only take place voluntarily – for altruistic reasons – and rejects the trade 
in these human body parts. Any costs incurred by the donor may be reimbursed. 

63 A gang in the Chinese province of Guangdong engaged in the illegal trade in blood. They sold the blood 
of at least two hundred paid donors to blood banks. The donors gave blood much more frequently than 
permitted, sometimes as often as ten times per month. The blood was then sold on with false donor names 
and subjected to little screening. The gang primarily used poor migrants from the countryside who had 
gone to the urban areas in hopes of improving their situation. “Blood gang rounded up in China” [“Bloed-
bende” opgerold in China], Brabants Dagblad, 9 April 2007, www.brabantsdagblad.nl/algemeen/bdbuiten-

64 In March 2008 Trouw reported on a situation that sounds like human trafficking. Five people were arrested 
in the Indian city of Gorakhpur on suspicion of having held fifteen indigent people hostage and selling their 
blood to private clinics. The victims, who were too weak to stand, had been lured to Gorakhpur with the 
promise of high paying work. The leader of the gang reportedly earned approximately 50,000 rupees (790 
euros) per day from the trade. “Indian suspects of blood trading arrested” [Indiase verdachten van handel in

Recommendations

14.1 Introduction

In its previous reports the NRM has made recommendations on a number of key issues. The 
subjects included: giving sufficient priority to practical efforts to tackle human trafficking; 
ensuring that the agencies with a role in tackling human trafficking have sufficient capacity; 
creating the right attitude among agencies confronted in one way or another with human 
trafficking; raising awareness of human trafficking and its manifestations among profes-
sionals and the public; the provision of care for victims and the registration of victims; and 
education and training for professionals. Progress has been made on these issues in many 
respects. Nevertheless, they still require attention. This chapter contains a new set of recom-
mendations, some of them constituting an updating of recommendations made in previous 
reports.

The NRM feels that the Human Trafficking Task Force has an important role to play in fol-
lowing up the recommendations. The task force was established to remove obstacles to the 
effective implementation of policy against human trafficking that have been found to exist 
in practice. It is for that reason that the task force consists of representatives of the agencies 
that play a key role in tackling human trafficking. The task force is asked to promote the im-
plementation of policy.

The Dutch policy against human trafficking is laid down in the National Human Trafficking 
Action Plan (NAM; December 2004) and the additional measures adopted in 2006. The task 
force has also written an Action Plan, which was most recently updated in a Progress Report 
in September 2009. In the action plan, the task force enumerated ten specific measures to 
address problems it had identified. In this way, the task force is making an essential contribu-
tion to tackling human trafficking. Despite the existence of the action plan, the policy prin-
ciples that are laid down in the NAM still apply. The action plan and the additional measures 
failed to devote specific attention is underage victims.

As regards the earlier recommendation concerning the availability of sufficient capacity, it 
has to be remembered that capacity is not a goal in itself but that it is always important to 
assess whether the policy objectives in this important area can be achieved with the available 
resources. Factors such as priorities, attitude, awareness and training naturally play a promi-
nent role in this regard. For example, it is important in this context that human trafficking 
teams already formed by the police are not abolished since otherwise the expertise they have 
gained will be lost.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

556

One of the recommendations in the Fifth Report of the NRM was that the public prosecu-
tion service should give practical effect to its policy priority of fighting human trafficking, 
Major steps have been taken to address human trafficking in the sense of sexual exploitation. 
However, there are still shortcomings in the investigation and prosecution of other forms 
of exploitation (exploitation outside the sex industry). It is therefore necessary to formulate 
specific measures to address these other forms of exploitation and carry them out in prac-
tice.

Earlier reports also drew attention to the so-called facilitators: individuals and organisations 
that are not directly involved in human trafficking but who consciously or unconsciously 
contribute to it through their work. Examples are forgers of documents, fraudulent employ-
ment agencies and job placement agencies, and financial and legal advisors, but also doctors 
for instance. There are also many more occupations that could become facilitators. One ex-
ample is tattoo artists, since some human traffickers have their victims tattooed. This profes-
sional group could also be alert to possible signs of trafficking.

There are a large number of partners in the anti-human trafficking chain. Several years ago 
the police decided to evaluate its own performance in tackling human trafficking by intro-
ducing the Police Force Monitor. Other agencies could do the same and by doing so accept 
responsibility for their own performance in this field.

The new recommendations relate to legislation, aliens policy, enforcement and local policy, 
awareness and identification of human trafficking, training and education, help for victims, 
investigation, improving the quality of crime-reporting, prosecutions, trials, the registration 
of victims, data collection and the human rights approach.

The recommendations are arranged by subject and differ in terms of their urgency. For ex-
ample, some recommendations can be carried out relatively easily and quickly, while others 
will require more effort.

14.2 The recommendations

Legislation
1. It is important that the Act on the regulation of prostitution lays down rules to harmo-

nise the policies of municipalities to prevent the so-called waterbed effect.
2. The aggravating circumstance for sentencing based on the age of sexual majority (which 

is 16 in the Netherlands) is irrelevant for human trafficking, in the sex industry or oth-
erwise. The age prescribed in article 273f (3) (2) of the Dutch Criminal Code should be 
raised to 18.

3. It should be made possible by law for a decision on a claim by an injured party that is 
submitted in accordance with article 51b of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure to be 
made at the same time as the decision on the demand for an order to confiscate criminal 
assets.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   556 09-06-10   00:13



Recommendations

557

Aliens policy
4. In ground a of Chapter B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines the words ‘have 

led to a conviction’ should be replaced by the words ‘to have led to a prosecution’’. Conse-
quently, ground b would lapse and the explanatory memorandum will have to be amended. 
If ground a is amended, guarantees will have to be created to ensure that the victim remains 
available and willing to cooperate with an investigation and prosecution. Given the terms 
of the regulation, this amendment will not necessarily lead to more applications for con-
tinued residence being granted. It would significantly shorten the period of uncertainty for 
victims about their future. It might also make victims more willing to report offences. The 
decision to prosecute is also an objective criterion with respect to a person’s status as vic-
tim. Finally, this amendment would also resolve the problem that it is not easy for victims 
to submit the judgment in the human trafficking case relating to them.

5. Decisions based on immigration law concerning victims who are also offenders should 
take account of a person’s status as a victim and the relationship between the offence 
committed by the victim and the human trafficking situation. Every victim who cooper-
ates in the criminal investigation of a human trafficker should be entitled to the rights 
under the B9 regulation, in principle even if the victim has criminal antecedents. In the 
case of a victim who has committed a criminal offence, that person’s status as a victim 
and the relationship between the offence and the human trafficking situation should also 
be explicitly taken into account in reaching a decision to declare that person an undesir-
able alien or on the right to continued residence and it is not enough to simply refer to a 
conviction as a ground for the decision.

6. Steps should be taken to ensure that the agreement to create security files to allow repa-
triation to proceed in a responsible fashion is actually complied with. The premise that 
when reportingh human trafficking leads to a conviction of the defendants it is estab-
lished in law that repatriation of the victim to the country of origin involves risks (B16/7, 
ground a) should also apply for complainants who are witnesses.

Enforcement and local policy
7. Municipalities should take the initiative for a ‘chain approach’ to human trafficking – 

which is not limited to dealing with the loverboy problem – directed by a single official. 
The logical solution for smaller municipalities that are unable or unwilling to adopt their 
own chain approach is to cooperate with larger municipalities. The VNG can provide the 
necessary support in establishing a chain approach.

8. A care coordinator should be appointed in every region.
9. A ‘comprehensive approach’ is required to guarantee the effectiveness of efforts to tackle 

human trafficking in the sex industry. Elements of such an approach are:
 – improved control of the licensed prostitution sector to prevent human trafficking, 

including the investment of time in building up a relationship of trust with the pros-
titutes working in the sector and making thorough enquiries about signs of human 
trafficking;

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   557 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

558

 – a crack down on illegal prostitution;
 – clear written agreements concerning the allocation of tasks between the police and 

municipalities.
10. Municipalities on one hand, and police and the public prosecution service on the other, 

should improve the provision of relevant information to each other. Municipalities, the 
police and the public prosecution service should also monitor the various initiatives that 
have already been taken in this regard and try to ensure the sharing of information actu-
ally yields results.

Awareness and identification
11. Indications of human trafficking in the sense of exploitation in sectors other than the sex 

industry should be reported immediately to SIOD/EMM by the Labour Inspectorate 
and by other inspectorates and investigative agencies. The instructions to the Labour 
Inspectorate about which indications inspectors should report immediately to SIOD/
EMM, and when, should be tightened up. This could also involve comparison of the da-
tabases of the Labour Inspectorate and the SIOD.

12. Identification of other forms of exploitation by all the relevant agencies needs to improve. 
Specifically, this means that the Labour Inspectorate (in the workplace), the SIOD (in 
the workplace), the aliens police and the Koninklijke Marechaussee (at the time of the 
detention of aliens), the IND (during the asylum procedure) and Repatriation and De-
parture Service (in aliens detention centres) can be expected to be proactive in making 
enquiries about and otherwise searching for signs of human trafficking.

13. In light of the sector’s vulnerability to human trafficking and the unwillingness of vic-
tims to report offences, an effort should be made to establish more ‘eyes and ears’ in the 
prostitution sector. To realise this it is important for all relevant agencies, including the 
Labour Inspectorate, the fire brigade and the municipal health service, to scrutinise the 
applicable licensing conditions. The chain approach could play a role in this. Operators 
and managers of sex establishments and prostitutes should also be informed of how they 
can report abuses and their responsibility to do so.

14. The Child Protection Council and child care services should be alert to signs of human 
trafficking, for example recognising and responding to signs of victims of loverboys, of 
victims among Roma children and in their advice on sentencing of underage victims as 
offenders.

15. Following recommendation 33 in NRM5 for the continuation of the publicity campaign 
on exploitation in the sex industry entitled Appearances are deceptive, a permanent public 
information campaign should be started to raise awareness about other forms of exploi-
tation.

16. When they are being issued with a visa, domestic staff employed by diplomats should be 
given written information, in addition to a verbal explanation, about their rights, includ-
ing the telephone numbers and addresses of relevant agencies, the police and the Minis-
try of Foreign Affairs for the event that they face exploitation.

Recommendations

559

Training and education
17. Police officers in executive positions, who can all encounter human trafficking, should 

be well informed about what human trafficking (including other forms of exploitation) 
involves and about the signs that could indicate human trafficking, and how they should 
make a record of these signs so that human trafficking can be traced and dealt with on 
the basis of information.

18. Every agency that could be confronted with victims of human trafficking should receive 
training in how to recognise signs of human trafficking and the exploitation of victims. 
Specifically, working conditions inspectors should be trained in how to identify other 
forms of exploitation and that human-trafficking training should start soon for SIOD in-
vestigators. It is also important to repeat the training and also provide it for new inspec-
tors and investigators. Joint training for the Labour Inspectorate (labour market fraud 
and working conditions inspectors) and the aliens police could help to increase their 
awareness of each other’s powers and duties and of their respective roles when potential 
victims of forms of exploitation outside the sex industry are discovered.

19. A course should be developed for the public prosecution service and the judiciary cover-
ing the entire spectrum of human trafficking. Professional meetings, as the SSR calls 
them, should also be organised.

20. With regard to the application of the non-punishment principle, the problems of victims 
of human trafficking who are also suspected of offences should be regularly reviewed by 
the police, the public prosecution service, the judiciary, lawyers, aid agencies, the Child 
Protection Council, the probation service and the IND. For example, the problems fac-
ing victims who are suspects and the non-punishment principle should be covered in 
courses and during training.

Help for victims
21. An early start should be made with the pilot project on category-oriented shelter, in which 

a distinction should be made between the various groups of victims in terms of gender, 
age and the nature of their exploitation. The pilot project should also encompass the shel-
ter provided for underage victims. The key aspects of that part of the project should be a 
pedagogic climate, small groups, safety and education. Existing practical know-how and 
expertise should be used in the design and operation of these shelters.

22. The capacity for providing shelter for victims should be increased, including the capac-
ity of residential (closed or protected or open) youth care as well as the capacity for ac-
commodating both minors and adult victims who can move on from the initial shelter.

23. The agencies concerned with forms of exploitation outside the sex industry should make 
agreements about who is responsible for arranging help for possible victims of those 
forms of exploitation. As mentioned in the Council of Procurators General’s Instruc-
tions on Human Trafficking, during specific actions detailed plans should be drawn up 
specifying which agency will do what and when so that victims do not fall through gaps 
in the system.

560

24. The nature of human trafficking is changeable and the authorities should therefore 
conscious of potential ensuing changes in the categories of victims. The help provided 
should respond accordingly.

25. The Human Trafficking Task Force is advised to devote particular attention to underage 
victims.

Investigations
26. The reference framework on human trafficking prepared by the police, which contains 

useful measures and standards for handling human trafficking cases, should be adopted by 
every police force. Every police force should have a specialist human trafficking team.

27. The teams in the police forces that review which cases will be dealt with should assume 
that – in accordance with the Instruction on Human Trafficking – human trafficking 
cases must always be investigated.

28. It should be made clear which division of the police organisation will handle human traf-
ficking investigations (including cases of non-sexual exploitation) so that it is not nec-
essary to ‘shop around’ with cases. This recommendation applies for both individual 
police forces and the Supra-regional and National Criminal Intelligence Services, which 
must also earmark sufficient capacity for human trafficking cases.

29. Non-location-bound prostitution (for example via Internet and escort agencies) should 
also be controlled. This is difficult, since methods that formerly seemed effective now ap-
pear to be less successful, and effective control in only possible at national or international 
level. New methods should be developed and experts in electronic media should be hired. 
One instrument that could help in this respect is a multimedia covenant (similar to the 
covenant on erotic advertisements) requiring sex businesses to give their licence number 
and the address of their establishment in advertisements. This instrument is only useful, 
however, if the information can also be verified. Another idea might be to require these 
sex businesses to have a permanent telephone number, which is also used by clients.

30. When all of the forces were directly represented in it, one of the functions of the Dutch 
police’s National Expert Group on Human Trafficking was to encourage and motivate 
forces for whom human trafficking was less of a priority. The group should continue to 
perform that role in the new, decentralised structure.

31. Information should be supplied to Europol in accordance with the agreements that have 
been made, with a view to increasing international cooperation between police forces, 
both operational and in terms of sharing information. This will yield a greater insight into 
the methods employed by human traffickers and what needs to be done to combat them.

Improving the quality of crime-reporting
32. In connection with the fact that some reports of human trafficking provide few if any 

leads for an investigation, take up capacity in terms of personnel (the public prosecution 
service and police) and reception facilities, but ultimately cannot be solved, the follow-
ing recommendations are made. In the short term, the existing rules should be left as

Recommendations

561

they are but the procedures (a decision not to prosecute, objection) should be speeded 
up as far as possible. Further research should be conducted into the reasons for the ab-
sence of leads that can be investigated and the unwillingness of victims to report human 
trafficking. There should also be a pilot project, involving a small number of reporting of 
crime that provide few leads for an investigation, in an attempt to improve the quality of 
the crime-reporting and to assess whether this could produce more grounds for investi-
gation. Such a pilot project could also investigate whether more specific form of help in 
category-oriented shelters could help to produce better reports.

Prosecution
33. Attempted human trafficking is seldom prosecuted. Nevertheless, the case-law of the 

Supreme Court on attempted human trafficking provides an adequate basis for doing so. 
The public prosecution service is advised to address this issue. A successful prosecution 
for attempted human trafficking could have a preventive effect.

34. It is recommended that the public prosecution service should not decide not to prosecute 
a human trafficking case until after it has reported the case to the EMM for comparison 
with other ongoing human trafficking investigations and received feedback.

35. In cases involving exploitation outside the sex industry, a consolidated approach is im-
portant. This means that both human trafficking and the related criminal offences (of-
fences under the Economics Offences Act, the Aliens Employment Act and the Mini-
mum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act) are tried by the same forum at the 
same time so that the judge has a complete picture of the human trafficking.

36. The fact that a person is a victim of human trafficking should be made a ground for de-
clining to prosecute in accordance with the non-punishment principle.

37. A provision should be inserted in the Instructions on Human Trafficking that when a 
victim commits a criminal offence the fact that the suspect is a victim must be noted in 
the official report. If it is decided to prosecute a suspect who is also a victim, the public 
prosecutors in the cases against the human trafficker and the victim should inform each 
other of their appointment.

38. Financial investigations are almost always conducted in human trafficking cases. It is 
important for the judge that decides on the victim’s claim as an injured party to have 
the financial report. The public prosecutor can either bring the claim for confiscation of 
criminal assets at the same time as the main case or submit the financial report during 
the hearing of the main case.

Trial
39. There should also be judges that specialise in human trafficking. Given the number of 

cases on an annual basis, attention should also be given to finding ways of retaining the 
accumulated expertise.

40. Guidelines should be developed for the purposes of consistency of sentencing in human 
trafficking cases.

Registration of victims and data collection
41. Besides serving as a reporting centre for notifications by victims, CoMensha should also 

actively collect information and keep records about the further progress of the cases 
involving registered.

42. All of the relevant agencies should report all victims of all forms of human trafficking to 
CoMensha. This means that:

 – not only the police and public prosecution service must report, but also all the other 
relevant agencies;

 – not only victims of sexual exploitation must be reported, but also victims of other 
forms of exploitation

 – not only aliens must be reported, but also Dutch victims.
43. Data from the public prosecution service should be structured in such a way that in-

formation can be derived from it about the occurrence of the different forms of human 
trafficking (sexual exploitation, exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry and 
for the purpose of organ removal).

44. It is recommended that a so-called cohort analysis should be carried out to provide in-
sight into the entire course of the proceedings in registered cases.

45. A computerised system should be developed for keeping centralised and standardised 
records of all (potential) victims of human trafficking who have submitted an application 
or are known to the IND. The register should maintain a distinction between initial deci-
sions, decisions on objections and decisions on objections after appeal.

Human rights approach
46. Provisions concerning help to and protection of victims in the new EU Framework Deci-

sion should not lead to restrictions on what has been achieved in the Council of Europe’s 
Convention on Action against Trafficking Human Beings (2005).

47. For the purposes of a human rights approach to combating human trafficking, a strategy 
should be developed for dealing with the effects these measures against human traffick-
ing can have on human rights and collateral damage should be avoided as far as possible 
in the implementation of new policy.

Summary

15.1 Introduction

Efforts to tackle human trafficking are receiving a lot of attention, both in the media and in 
politics. The perception of human trafficking as a serious problem has, if possible, actually 
increased and a wide range of measures are being taken to tackle it. For example, a task force 
has been created, the police and public prosecution services have made human trafficking 
a priority and there is more specialist help available for victims. Another development has 
been the introduction of a programmatic approach designed to identify areas in which prac-
tical barriers can be placed in the way of human traffickers. The organisations that provide 
help for victims are also cooperating more closely with partners in the chain by sharing in-
formation and referring victims.

Human trafficking takes place covertly. Even the victims are often unwilling to report their 
exploitation, which is why efforts to prevent human trafficking depend so heavily on identify-
ing and responding to signs that it is occurring. It is therefore essential to raise awareness. It 
is crucial that signs of possible abuses are recognised. Employees of the police forces and of 
various government inspectorates are being trained in this. However, numerous other profes-
sionals can also encounter situations involving exploitation. It is vital to find ways of inform-
ing these professional groups about the problem and how they can identify the signs.

This summary follows the order of the chapters in the report: legislation (§15.2), interna-
tional developments (§15.3), victims and help for victims (§15.4), B9 and continued residence 
(B16/7) (§15.5), victims as offenders and the non-punishment principle (§15.6), the adminis-
trative and integrated approach to human trafficking (in the sex industry) (§15.7), investiga-
tion (§15.8), suspects and offenders (§15.9), the public prosecution service and prosecution 
(§15.10), case-law on exploitation in the sex industry (§15.11), exploitation in sectors other 
than the sex industry (§15.12) and human trafficking with a view to organ removal (§15.13).

15.2 Legislation

15.2.1  Sentences

The sentences for human trafficking were increased with effect from 1 July 2009. Since then 
the maximum prison sentence for human trafficking without aggravating circumstances has 
been eight years. Persons convicted of any aggravated form of human trafficking face a sen-
tence of at least a imprisonment for up to twelve years.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

564

Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (the B9 regulation) has also been 
amended in several respects. For example, in April 2009 a new description of the target 
groups appeared, which was intended to reflect more clearly that the B9 regulation applies 
identically to (potential) victims of human trafficking who work or have worked in the sex 
industry and (potential) victims of human trafficking subjected to other forms of exploita-
tion (article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code). The period of reflection is now also avail-
able to victims and potential victims who enter the country through Schiphol airport. These 
most recent amendments to the B9 scheme apply with retroactive force from 1 January 2009. 
Chapter 5 contains a summary of the operation of the current B9 regulation and the rules for 
continued residence (Chapter B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines).

15.2.2  Bill to regulate prostitution and tackle abuses in the sex industry

An important development in the legislative field was the publication of the draft bill to regu-
late prostitution and tackle abuses in the sex industry. Under the terms of this bill, every sex 
business must be licensed. At the time this report went to press it was not yet known when 
the bill would be sent to parliament. Although the advisory report of the National Rappor-
teur on Trafficking in Human Beings (NRM) on the bill is attached as an appendix (see ap-
pendix 5) and still applies in full, this section also refers to some of the issues and problems 
raised in that report which still need to be addressed.

A positive aspect of the bill is that it creates a national framework within which every mu-
nicipality must adopt rules governing sex businesses and independent prostitutes. This will 
reduce the discrepancies between municipal policies on prostitution, and hence the differ-
ences in supervision and enforcement that human traffickers can take advantage of. However, 
uniform rules and consistent policy are also crucial in tackling human trafficking and from 
that perspective municipalities are still given too many options, with all the risks that entails. 
The proposal to link licences to activities rather than to an establishment will greatly help 
in the fight against human trafficking. The proposal corresponds to a large extent with the 
recommendation in the NRM’s Fifth Report (2007) calling for the formulation of a national 
legislative framework for prostitution policy based on the principle that every municipality 
must set rules for all establishments where commercial sexual transactions are undertaken 
or where commercial facilities are provided for such transactions to be undertaken with or 
for a third party.

The scope of application of the bill is not yet entirely clear. For example, the scope of the 
term ‘sex businesses’ is very wide when seen in the context of the draft explanatory memo-
randum. At the same time, the current title of the draft bill seems to be restrictive (‘to regu-
late prostitution and some other forms of sex-related business activity’). The title of the bill 
should itself reflect the fact that it also encompasses new and future forms of commercial 
sexual activity, of which webcam sex, where sexual acts are performed commercially for a 
third party on the Internet, is just one example.

Summary

565

Furthermore, an independent prostitute is defined as a prostitute who does not work ex-
clusively for a prostitution business. This definition, and the explanatory note to it, raises a 
number of questions relating, for example, to the definition of ‘prostitution business’. For 
example, how can it be determined that a person is working only for a prostitution business 
and not at least partially for themselves? This distinction is particularly important in light 
of the proposal to make registration mandatory. That requirement is currently confined to 
prostitutes who work independently. The distinction would be less relevant if all sex workers 
had to register.

According to the proposal, the register of sex workers will include their names and address-
es, a telephone number and a copy of their passport. The question is whether this is enough. 
A comprehensive system should also include a passport photograph and a record of the type 
of sex work performed (for example, at home or as an escort) and the workplace if the sex 
work is performed at a specific location. Given the sensitivity of these details, access to and 
use of this information must be accompanied by sufficient safeguards for the privacy of the 
individuals concerned.

The bill does not provide for an intake interview during the registration process, even though 
besides generating information this would provide an opportunity to identify possible signs 
of human trafficking. Holding such an interview would meet the obligation of government 
bodies to investigate the relevant facts before taking action.

The introduction of a national register will make it possible to enforce tighter supervision 
of the escort service industry and make it easier to regulate companies that advertise on the 
Internet. The register should also include a record if a licence, or an extension of a licence, is 
refused, together with an explanation of the reasons for the refusal. Other licensing authori-
ties and regulatory authorities (municipalities) should also have access to this information. 
Supervisory authorities should have round-the-clock access to the register.

Under the terms of the bill it is an offence for a prostitute to work for a prostitution business 
that does not have a licence or to work independently as a prostitute without being registered 
or to advertise without a registration number. Making it a punishable offence for sex work-
ers to work without being registered or to advertise without a registration number is in itself 
correct as the logical cornerstone of the duty to register. However, it should not as a matter of 
course be a criminal offence for a prostitute to work in an unlicensed establishment. It would 
seem more logical for the municipality to deal with this offence with an administrative fine, 
which is more in line with the policy principle that criminal law will not be used unnecessar-
ily against victims.

One problem that remains is that the bill says nothing about the obligation of local authori-
ties to take action or about the allocation of tasks between the local authority and the police. 
This vacuum increases the risk that the provisions of the law will not be adequately super-
vised and enforced. However, it is worth noting here that the Human Trafficking Task Force 
is preparing a strategy document on this point.

15.2.3 Other legislation

Chapter 2 also discusses the Police Data Act and Police Data Decree, the Aliens Employ-
ment Act, an amendment to the Housing Act, the Public Nuisance (Administrative Fine) Act 
and the Closed Youth Care Act.

Pending legislation includes bills to implement relevant international law, such as the Coun-
cil of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) and the 
Council of Europe’s Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation 
and Sexual Abuse (the Lanzarote Convention, 2007). Other relevant pieces of legislation are 
bills to enhance the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, a draft bill to expand the 
possibilities for confiscating illegally obtained profits and a bill on the liability of companies 
for temporary employees that they hire.

15.3 International developments

Human trafficking also remains an important theme in various international forums. The ac-
tivities of international governmental organisations – the United Nations (and the International 
Labour Organisation), the European Union (EU), the Council of Europe and the Organisation 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – highlight particular concerns on a number 
of topics, including exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry, the root causes of hu-
man trafficking and the demand side of human trafficking. Vulnerable groups such as women 
and children also receive special attention at the international level. Child pornography is also 
being addressed in the development of instruments to tackle sexual and other forms of exploi-
tation of children. Continued attention is also being given to combating human trafficking in 
connection with the deployment of troops and civilians to areas of conflict.

Various international organisations, in particular the EU and OSCE, have explicitly referred 
to the importance of countries adopting a national action plan against human trafficking. 
There are growing calls for states to appoint a national rapporteur or create a similar mecha-
nism to monitor measures that have been taken and to evaluate policy.

During Sweden’s EU presidency, the first steps have already been taken to establish a net-
work of national rapporteurs and similar mechanisms with meetings in Stockholm and Vi-
enna in 2009. It is not yet clear how the network will evolve in the future. A similar meeting 
was also held in Brussels.

A crucial aspect of efforts to tackle international human trafficking is the collection of reli-
able data. Various international initiatives have been taken in this context, including steps to 
formulate international standards for data collection. To this end, a set of indicators about 
which national governments should provide information for the purposes of internation-
al comparison is being developed. There is not yet a single formal international standard. 
Moreover, many of the standards that have been developed up to now require the collection 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   566 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

567

of a lot of data, much of which is difficult to gather, with the likely consequence that the in-
formation supplied is incomplete and of poor quality. This creates the impression that while 
various international organisations are engaged in developing international data-collection 
systems different standards are being developed because of inadequate cooperation.

On paper, the international legal instruments are now very extensive. However, many coun-
tries are not yet party to instruments such as the UN Protocol against trafficking in persons 
and the underlying UN Convention against transnational organised crime. But these instru-
ments form an important basis for international cooperation in criminal law, particularly 
with countries outside the EU, including countries whose nationals have also been regis-
tered as victims of human trafficking in the Netherlands, such as China and India.

The EU should also continue to highlight the importance of ratifying these instruments, for 
example in the context of the external dimension of the justice and home affairs policy. A 
third of UN member states are still not parties to the UN Protocol.

Although most countries have made human trafficking in the sex industry a criminal of-
fence, few have done so with respect to human trafficking in other sectors (trafficking for 
forced labour) or human trafficking whose victims are men. Even states that have ratified 
the UN Palermo Protocol generally lag behind in its implementation due to the absence of 
comprehensive national legislation, a lack of resources for law enforcement and a lack of 
political will.

The Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) 
has also not been widely ratified. Even the Netherlands has not done because of its intention 
to amend the law to expand jurisdiction over human trafficking.

The European Commission’s evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Trafficking in Human Be-
ings shows that tackling human trafficking must remain high on the EU’s agenda. On a posi-
tive note, the Netherlands is continuing to press strongly for this (see also recommendation 
58 in the NRM’s Fifth Report), since the evaluation of the EU’s action plan shows that there 
is a wide gap between current legislation and its implementation in practice in Europe.

In March 2009, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new Framework De-
cision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. However, the adoption and implemen-
tation of the proposal for the new framework decision should not be at the expense of the 
ratification of the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings (2005). Provisions concerning help for and protection of victims in the proposal must 
not curtail what has been reached in the Council of Europe’s Convention. The proposal for 
a new EU framework decision must also not weaken the willingness to implement the provi-
sions of the Council of Europe’s Convention.

The EU Directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-coun-
try nationals, which entered into force on 20 July 2009, is also important for efforts to tackle 
human trafficking. This directive prescribes a number of minimum standards for sanctions 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   567 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

568

and measures against employers of subjects of third countries living illegally in a country. 
These minimum standards will probably require an amendment of Dutch law.

It is nowadays clear, both nationally and internationally, that human trafficking has to be 
regarded as a violation of human rights. This is also reflected in the work of the various 
bodies, including those of the UN, that supervise enforcement of human rights. It is a mark 
of progress that tackling human trafficking is now an explicit element of the Netherlands’ 
foreign policy on human rights. The human rights strategy in Dutch foreign policy should, 
however, more clearly reflect the fact that human trafficking also affects adults who are ex-
ploited in sectors other than the sex industry.

It is important for countries, like the Netherlands, that address human trafficking as a human 
rights issue to anticipate the potential effects of measures to prevent human trafficking on 
those same human rights and to avoid collateral damage as far as possible. A strategy needs 
to be formulated for achieving this. A relevant factor in this context is that a number of inter-
national bodies that monitor compliance with human rights argue, also with respect to the 
Netherlands, that the provision of help to victims should not depend on their cooperation 
with the investigation, criminal or otherwise, of human trafficking.

15.4 Victims and help for victims

15.4.1 Shelter

There is a shortage of capacity to provide shelter for victims. It is not always possible to pro-
vide immediate shelter, not just for specific categories of victims of human trafficking such 
as men (usually victims of exploitation other than sexual), minors and victims suffering from 
particular problems such as psychiatric disorders or addiction, but even for female victims of 
exploitation in the sex industry. The waiting time can range from several days to weeks and 
even months.

Everyone concerned agrees in principle on the importance of providing shelter specially tai-
lored to the specific circumstances of the different groups of victims. The Human Traffick-
ing Task Force’s Action Plan proposed a pilot project on this topic, but unfortunately it has 
been delayed. The progress report on the action plan published on 9 September 2009 stated 
that in principle the pilot project is intended for all victims – women, men, any accompany-
ing children and minors – whether they are Dutch or of another nationality. This leaves open 
the question of whether a distinction will be made between the sexes and between the vari-
ous age groups in the facilities provided for category-based shelter. Category-based shelter 
does not mean that the distinction will no longer be made in these shelters. However, minors 
are not regarded as the primary target group of the pilot scheme, as is apparent, for example, 
from the fact that the tender for the project refers primarily to adult victims and does not 
cover essential aspects of care for minors, such as providing education and a pedagogical 
climate.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   568 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

569

The purpose of the project is in fact to determine how a system of shelter and care can be 
designed for each individual group of victims, specifically including closed or protected fa-
cilities for underage victims, within an overall system of open and enclosed facilities. The 
project can incorporate the experience that has already been gained with facilities estab-
lished for specific categories of victim such as Asja and MEISSA and in the Secured Care 
pilot project. It is important in this context that the pilot project should also explicitly be for 
underage victims, including girls for whom shelter in a closed or protected facility is most 
appropriate. Incidentally, it is unclear why agreement between the Ministry of Justice and 
the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport is required for underage victims. Primary respon-
sibility for them would seem to rest with the Minister for Youth and Family. Another aspect 
requiring attention is the capacity, or lack of it, for enclosed youth care.

Examples of facilities established for particular categories of victim are the Asja van Fier 
Fryslan centre for girls aged between of 14 and 24, and De Roggeveen and MEISSA cen-
tres run by the Amsterdam Human Trafficking Coordination Centre, which possess specific 
expertise and employ special methods. The two-year Secured Care pilot project started in 
January 2008. This project represents an attempt to offer protection for underage aliens who 
may be at risk of disappearing and being exploited. This is also a small-scale shelter.

There is also a trend towards the creation of private care accommodation, particularly for 
underage victims of human trafficking. There are risks associated with these initiatives how-
ever praiseworthy they may be. Shelters of this type demand specific expertise and a profes-
sional context. A lack of expertise can cause a lot of additional harm for this target group.

15.4.2 Groups at particular risk

Chapter 4 discusses several groups that are particularly at risk of becoming victims of hu-
man trafficking. They include women from the ‘La Strada’ countries, women and girls in 
asylum-seeker centres and the mildly mentally handicapped.

Special attention is devoted to Roma children. It is not easy to respond adequately to indica-
tions of human trafficking involving this group of children, partly because of the specific 
cultural context, the legal complexity of the problem, the risk of stigmatising the Roma as a 
group, the possible involvement of the parents in the exploitation and the absence of a body 
to coordinate the activities of the various agencies concerned with the problem. One thing 
that is clear is that the problem can only usefully be addressed proactively and from a Euro-
pean perspective.

15.4.3 Registration

The responsibility for keeping a national register of (suspected) victims has been delegated 
to the Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha). However, the registration 
is incomplete and needs to be improved. The Ministry of Justice has provided CoMensha 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   569 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

570

with additional funds for this purpose. As part of the Human Trafficking Task Force’s action 
plan, CoMensha has already submitted a plan for a project to improve the registration of 
victims. Together with the agencies that provide information, CoMensha will explore what 
information needs to be registered. CoMensha will also press for a commitment that the 
data will actually be supplied.

15.4.4 Care coordinator

The care coordinator manages the care providers and other partners in the chain and is re-
sponsible, among other things, for arranging suitable shelter and care.

Many regions still do not have a care coordinator. The task force says in its action plan that it 
will encourage municipalities to appoint a regional care coordinator.

15.4.5 Compensation

When the court makes an order for the payment of compensation in criminal proceed-
ings it is collected for the victim by the Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB). Between 
2000 and 2003 the CJIB was involved in between three and five human-trafficking cases 
annually. That number has risen significantly since 2003 to between nine and seventeen 
cases.

Chapter 11 also illustrates the difficult of actually recovering damages for victims. Although 
an order to pay compensation does mean that the victim does not personally have to chase 
the perpetrator to recover the money, the procedure offers no guarantee of an early settle-
ment or even that the money will ultimately be recovered.

It is important in this context that the bill designed to strengthen the position of the victim 
in criminal proceedings makes provision for the payment of an advance on compensation 
by the Violent Offences Compensation Fund. The Minister of Justice has explained that this 
provision is intended for victims of violent crimes and sexual offences. The offences actually 
covered by the scheme will be specified in a later Order in Council but it stands to reason that 
the scheme will also apply for victims of human trafficking.

15.4.6 The Violent Offences Compensation Fund

In assessing applications from victims (at present only victims of sexual exploitation), the 
Compensation Fund mainly considers the extent to which the applicant was so dependent 
as to be persuaded to perform sexual acts with third parties. Circumstances that can influ-
ence the decision are: the victim’s passport was confiscated; the victim had to surrender all 
or most of the earnings, the victim was under constant supervision or locked up, the vic-
tim’s freedom of movement was constrained or the victim was intimidated or assaulted. The 
Fund received 25 applications from victims of human trafficking in 2007, 18 of which were 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   570 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

571

awarded. In 2008, 19 applications were submitted, one of which was rejected because the 
Fund found on the basis of statements by the victim and further investigation of its own that 
human trafficking had not been shown to be a case of human trafficking.
In its action plan, the task force proposes measures to increase the use of the compensation 
fund.

15.5 B9 and continued residence (B16/7)

15.5.1	 Clarification	of	the	B9	regulation	and	associated	agreements

The B9 regulation gives certain rights to victims of exploitation in the sex industry, but 
equally to victims of exploitation in other sectors. However, the terms of the regulation were 
not entirely clear with regard to the identification of victims of ‘other forms of exploitation’. 
In April 2009, the relevant passages were clarified without revising the policy. This is a sig-
nificant improvement since, particularly in the case of exploitation in sectors other than the 
sex industry, government agencies do not always seem able to recognise signs of human traf-
ficking and do not always know how the B9 regulation should be applied. Obviously, it is not 
only the police and special investigative services that have to immediately inform an alien of 
the rights laid down in the B9 regulation. The Labour Inspectorate must also do so if it dis-
covers aliens who are not living legally in the Netherlands in a workplace. The Instructions 
on Trafficking in Human Beings for the public prosecution service and the police further 
state that victims of human trafficking must be reported to CoMensha for the purposes of 
arranging shelter and coordinating care. However, it should also be clear to other agencies 
such as the Labour Inspectorate and the Social Intelligence and Investigation Service (SIOD) 
that they have to report victims to CoMensha and what the procedure is for doing so. The B9 
regulation recommends that in preparing actions targeted at illegal aliens the police should 
expressly consider the possibility of human trafficking and make preparations for providing 
care for possible victims. This can be done by contacting CoMensha before the actions take 
place. However, this is not mentioned in the public prosecution service’s Instructions on 
Trafficking in Human Beings.

To avoid any misunderstanding on this point, it should be clear that all government agencies 
must report all victims of all forms of human trafficking to CoMensha. In other words:

 – not only the police and OM must report victims, but also all other relevant agencies;
 – not only victims of sexual exploitation should be reported, but also victims of other forms 

of exploitation;
 – not only aliens should be reported, but also Dutch victims.

It is very important that all relevant government agencies are aware of the policy rules and 
associated agreements and pursue the same policy. Naturally, there has to be agreement on 
which government agency is responsible for (potential) victims. This can be achieved by 
making firm agreements in which tasks, powers and responsibilities are clearly allocated.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   571 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

572

There is sometimes also confusion about the differences in the B9 regulation between vic-
tims and witnesses, for example over the period within which the IND has to decide on an 
application for residence.

There is regular overlap between criminal law and immigration law. A striking feature in this 
respect is the serious gaps in the knowledge of the other area of law among practitioners in 
each of these domains.

15.5.2 ‘Chanceless’ B9 applications

There are victims who provide so little information when they report an offence that the 
case cannot ultimately be solved. The police and public prosecution service devote a lot of 
capacity to these complaints because every human-trafficking case has to be investigated. 
There is a suspicion that some individuals who are not actually victims seize on the B9 
regulation as a last resort to secure continued residence. Every complaint must be treated 
with care, however, quite simply because it is so often difficult to recognise victims. There 
is no ready-made solution for the problem of balancing the need to respect the substantial 
interests of genuine victims on the one hand and the strain imposed on resources, includ-
ing the accompanying use of facilities for shelter and assistance, by possible abuses of the 
regulation on the other. What could prove very useful would be to explore all of the cir-
cumstances surrounding the reporting of human trafficking in more detail. In that con-
text, it is regrettable that the public prosecution service’s research department (WBOM) 
has discontinued the study ‘Human Trafficking: Chain, Victim and Knowledge Perspec-
tive’. The public prosecution service in The Hague has done the right thing by drawing up 
a practical plan describing precisely what has to be done at each step of the process from 
the time of an informal interview to the decision not to prosecute or to investigate the case 
further.

The introduction of shelter for specific categories of victims and arranging adequate legal 
advice can be expected to increase the willingness of victims to report offences.

15.5.3  Linking of right of residence to reporting of offence/cooperation with 
criminal proceedings

Their cooperation with a criminal investigation is a precondition for granting a (temporary) 
residence permit to victims and witnesses in human-trafficking cases.

Aliens are informed that they can report an offence or otherwise cooperate with the inves-
tigation immediately, but that under the B9 regulation they can also do so after a period of 
reflection, during which they have up to three months to calmly consider their decision.

It is important to make a distinction between the likelihood of a possible prosecution for 
human trafficking and the possibility that a person is a victim of human trafficking. Even if a 
report does not provide any good leads and the investigation does not lead to a prosecution, 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   572 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

573

the complainant may still be a victim. An unbelievable story does not necessarily mean that 
the individual concerned is not a victim of human trafficking. The human trafficker may have 
instructed the victim to apply for B9 status and provided her with a story for that purpose. 
The victim may also be reluctant to provide specific facts out of fear of the human trafficker. 
In deciding whether there is too little evidence of human trafficking, therefore, what needs 
to be considered is not just whether there is sufficient evidence for an investigation but also 
whether there are indications that the individual concerned is a victim.

15.5.4 Objections

An alien must inform the police within fourteen days of being notified that a case will not be 
prosecuted further whether he or she will object to the appeal court against that decision pur-
suant to article 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure. It is unclear how this can be recon-
ciled with the fact that no period is stipulated for filing an objection as such in article 12 of the 
Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure (except in the case of a notification that a prosecution will 
not proceed, in which case the period is three months). The period of two weeks prescribed in 
the B9 regulation for informing the police of whether or not an objection will be lodged is only 
relevant in connection with the consequences for entitlement to residence. The deadline says 
nothing about the period within which an objection actually has to be submitted.

BNRM’s survey of objections relating to human trafficking shows that the objection was re-
jected in 43 of the 44 cases investigated. Although many of the complaints contained no leads 
or insufficient grounds for an investigation, according to the appeal court the police never-
theless often conducted a detailed investigation. The appeals court therefore found that the 
police had generally done their work well.

Since the middle of 2008 the appeals court in Amsterdam has explicitly considered whether 
or not the case was reported to the Expertise Centre on Trafficking in Human Beings and 
People Smuggling (EMM). Other appeal courts could follow that example.

The average period that elapsed between the receipt of an objection and the decision of the 
appeal court ranged from six to nine months.

15.5.5  Continued residence (Chapter B16/7 of the Aliens Act Implementation 
Guidelines)

The changes that have been made since August 2006 to the rules for continued residence 
after the termination of a residence permit under the B9 regulation are largely connected 
with observed shortcomings in the rules and a desire to relax the policy. The revised policy 
simplifies the rules both for the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and for vic-
tims and it seems legitimate to expect that the changes will shorten the period of uncer-
tainty for victims. Nevertheless, there do seem to be some problems with the implementa-
tion of the policy in practice. One problem concerns the flow of information between the 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   573 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

574

authorities involved in the criminal investigation of human trafficking (the police and public 
prosecution service), the IND and the alien or her authorised representative. IND officials 
sometimes have to take a great deal of trouble to discover the status or the outcome of the 
investigation or the trial in a human-trafficking case. That information can be crucial for 
victims given the potentially serious implications for their residence status. Both the Aliens 
Act Implementation Guidelines and the Instructions on Trafficking in Human Beings of 
the Council of Procurators-General require the public prosecutor to notify both the IND 
and the victim as soon as a decision is made not to proceed with the prosecution or the 
final judgment is rendered. This rule is not always followed. There is often miscommunica-
tion, particularly when it is decided to discontinue a prosecution for human trafficking. The 
cases indicate that there is confusion about the notification to the individual concerned and 
the conditions attached to filing an objection. This is an area where the care coordinator 
could perform a useful role.

An alien who wishes to invoke ground a in the B16/7 regulation (a conviction for human 
trafficking or for another offence in an indictment that included human trafficking as a 
result of which there is an assumption in law that there are risks attached to repatriation to 
the country of origin) must personally submit a copy of the court’s judgment to show that 
he or she qualifies for continued residence. However, the victim is not a party to the pro-
ceedings and therefore does not have a copy of the judgment and may not even be aware 
of it.

Since the amendment of the B16/7 provision, the prime responsibility for deciding whether 
a person is a victim has shifted from the judge to the public prosecutor, since even acquittal 
on a charge of human trafficking but a conviction for other offences constitutes grounds for 
continued residence. In practice, victims remain uncertain about the decision on a request 
for continued residence for an extended period, even though it is already clear at the time 
of the prosecution that the public prosecution service regards them as victims. The victim 
would be spared a lot of time and uncertainty if the rule were amended to allow an appli-
cation for continued residence to be submitted as soon as the public prosecution service 
decides to summons a suspect. This practical amendment might also encourage victims to 
make a report of the crime with sufficient leads to launch a prosecution. It would then be 
necessary to create sufficient guarantees to ensure that the victim remains available and will-
ing to cooperate with the investigation and prosecution.

To help improve the method of assessing whether a victim should be granted continued resi-
dence for reasons of safety, in 2005 the partners in the chain agreed to start preparing ‘safety 
files’ on registered victims. However, in practice no safety files have yet been compiled. Nor 
is there any evidence that the IND regularly performs a risk analysis of its own before decid-
ing whether a victim can be required to return to his or her country of origin.

The IND’s decisions to allow continued residence for urgent reasons of a humanitarian na-
ture generally provide no insight into the considerations on which they are based.

15.6 Victims as offenders and the non-punishment principle

International legislation devotes a lot of attention to the problem of victims of human traf-
ficking who have also committed or are suspected of committing a criminal offence and 
the associated principle that under certain circumstances they should not be prosecuted 
or punished (the non-punishment principle). At the same time, it is clear that the scope of 
this principle has not yet been clearly defined, as is apparent from the varying definitions of 
the principle in different international instruments. Non-punishment provisions in inter-
national instruments relating purely to migration-related crime are very limited and do not 
cover the problem of victims of human trafficking who may be involved in various types of 
criminal activity in a human-trafficking situation. Cases studied in the Netherlands and in 
several other countries show that victims of human trafficking can be involved in a variety of 
offences in a human-trafficking situation.

The Netherlands has chosen not to adopt a specific non-punishment provision for victims 
who are also suspects. There are, however, various grounds in the Netherlands on which 
it may be decided not to prosecute or not to punish these victims who are also suspects. 
The non-punishment principle can be applied in Dutch legal practice with reference to the 
interpretation of the principle in the various international legal instruments. To avail of 
the possibilities arising from the non-punishment principle, however, it is important that 
victims are also identified as such by all of the relevant agencies in the chain. In practice, 
it is difficult to identify victims of human trafficking, particularly when those victims are 
initially suspected of a criminal offence committed in the human-trafficking situation. Fur-
thermore, the risk of prosecution can cause victims of human trafficking who are suspected 
of offences to think of themselves more as offenders than victims and so not make a com-
plaint. Even if a person is identified as a victim, it seems that in practice the relevant actors 
are not always aware of the existence of the legal possibilities of refraining from punishing 
or prosecuting the victim. Awareness of the problem and knowledge of the legal possibili-
ties are therefore crucial for applying the options for victims ensuing from the non-punish-
ment principle in practice.

Exploitation of victims in criminal endeavours is a form of human trafficking that is still not 
always recognised as such. In the case of exploitation in criminal activity, BNRM is particularly 
aware of offences against the Opium Act committed under compulsion or pressure in a human-
trafficking situation. For example, victims of loverboys and other human traffickers are some-
times forced to commit drug-related offences. Minors are particularly vulnerable to exploita-
tion in crime; victims in this category seem to commit theft and drug offences more often than 
other offences. This may be connected with a different system of sanctions for minors.

It is important to be aware that offences committed by victims are not always carried out 
under compulsion by the human trafficker. Victims will sometimes commit a crime, such as 
shoplifting, as a way of escaping from the human trafficker, as has occurred in the UK. There

was a case in Austria where a victim destroyed her passport for the same reason. How to deal 
with this problem is an issue that needs to be addressed.

Quite apart from the consequences under criminal law, offences committed by victims in a 
human-trafficking situation can have consequences for their status under immigration law. 
For example, BNRM is aware of a case of a convicted victim who did not receive a B9 resi-
dence permit although she cooperated fully with the criminal investigation into her human 
traffickers, who were in fact also convicted of the offence.

Another problem is that victims who are also convicted offenders run the risk of being de-
clared undesirable aliens and consequently being placed in aliens’ detention and deported. 
The possible consequences under immigration law for the residence status of victims who 
are also offenders are therefore an area of concern.

15.7	 	Administrative	and	integrated	approach	to	human	trafficking	(in	
the sex industry)

There have been several positive developments in this area. As part of the efforts of the Hu-
man Trafficking Task Force to improve supervision of the prostitution sector, a protocol/
manual on ‘supervision of the licensed prostitution sector’ is being written in consultation 
with the Ministry of the Interior and municipalities.

15.7.1 Prostitution sector

Since the legalisation of prostitution, there are now three sectors: the illegal, the legal li-
censed and the legal unlicensed. The idea that has been put forward of curtailing the licensed 
sector is in itself (in other words, without additional measures) an ineffective way of prevent-
ing human trafficking and abuses, since it could cause a shift to illegal forms of prostitution, 
which are more difficult to monitor and regulate through policy.

Prostitution, legal and illegal, takes many forms, and developments in the sector follow in 
rapid succession. To deal effectively with the effects of this in the form of human trafficking, 
an integrated approach incorporating administrative measures as well as criminal sanctions 
is required. One aspect that shows the need for this is the fact that in many places exploita-
tion in (illegal) prostitution is sometimes unconsciously facilitated, for example by hotels. 
New measures could be taken to address this, although experience shows that a crack down 
on one form of prostitution almost immediately causes activities to shift to other segments 
of the prostitution sector.

It is generally accepted that one of the aims of the policy should be to increase the ability of 
prostitutes to control their own lives so that they are less likely to become victims of human 
trafficking. However, it has to be noted in that context that this scarcely follows in those 
cases where human traffickers use severe means of coercion.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   576 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

577

A point that needs to be considered in any measures that are taken is that many prostitutes 
do not speak Dutch.

15.7.2 Prostitution policy and administrative enforcement

The aforementioned effect – that dealing with forms of exploitation in prostitution quickly 
leads to the relocation of illegal activities – is reinforced by the fact that municipalities are al-
lowed to formulate their own policy on prostitution. Consequently, there is no uniform pol-
icy towards the prostitution sector. For example, certain forms of prostitution are licensed 
in one municipality but not in another. Many municipalities also fail to adequately formulate 
and monitor the prostitution policy and its administrative enforcement. This is not helped 
by the hands-off approach of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG). Smaller 
local authorities in particular are sometimes reluctant to tackle human trafficking, either be-
cause they do not realise the urgency of the problem or because they do not feel they have 
sufficient powers.

The municipalities are responsible for pursuing an adequate prostitution policy. The police 
play an important role in the supervision and prevention of illegal prostitution. But in many 
municipalities there is no clear division of tasks between the local authority and the police. 
The powers to exercise supervision can differ from one local authority to another, and in 
some cases no powers have been delegated at all. This encourages human traffickers to be 
calculating in planning their activities.

Other agencies besides the local authority itself also have a role in supervision, including the 
fire brigade, the tax authorities and the Labour Inspectorate. There are numerous indica-
tions that not all of them perform their supervisory duties in the prostitution sector prop-
erly. These additional ‘eyes and ears’ are sorely missed. That is regrettable in a sector which 
is very sensitive to human trafficking, tackling which depends very much on identifying the 
signs. Illegal prostitution is often difficult to identify simply because it is difficult to prove 
that sexual acts are being performed commercially with third parties.

Oversight is particularly difficult in the case of forms of prostitution that occur outside clubs, 
as in the case of escort services and prostitution offered on the Internet. The effectiveness 
of the labour-intensive ‘hotel procedure’ in controlling escort services appears to have weak-
ened, perhaps because the method has become too well known. It is questionable whether 
the escort-service industry can be controlled at all. The control of licensed prostitution busi-
nesses does not in fact guarantee that human trafficking can be eradicated from them. Nor 
are the administrative controls in the prostitution sector always carried out properly. The 
superficial inspection of a prostitute’s papers, for example, will not expose exploitation. It 
requires holding interviews in a safe setting.

The Erotic Advertisements Covenant, under which anyone placing advertisements for erotic 
services must give their licence number or VAT number in the advertisement, has scarcely 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   577 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

578

any effect in curbing exploitation since its scope is too narrow (it only covers some printed 
media) and because the numbers are not checked.

15.7.3	 Administrative	approach	to	organised	crime/human	trafficking

The instrument of the administrative report (the written notification from the police to the 
executive of a municipality that in the course of their duties they have discovered facts and 
circumstances relevant for the municipality’s enforcement of human-trafficking policy) 
does not work properly. The police do not seem to have sufficient capacity to write good 
reports. The reports usually contain no information on which the municipalities can base 
specific action. For their part, municipalities also sometimes fail to pass on useful informa-
tion to the police.

15.7.4 Integrated approach

The programmatic approach, which involves systematic cooperation between chain part-
ners, is useful and necessary, but a number of pilot projects revealed that in terms of execu-
tion it needs to improve. In practice, the partner organisations do not cooperate, or at least 
not in the envisaged manner. Organisations are often unclear about what precisely they are 
required to do, or what they are expected to do does not match their priorities. Consequently, 
scarcely any information has been gathered about companies or agencies that unconsciously 
play a role in human trafficking. The integrated approach to human trafficking is not univer-
sally followed, partly because the partners concerned do not perceive human trafficking to 
be a problem and are therefore not willing to invest in a joint approach. Even partners that do 
adopt the integrated approach are sometimes hesitant. There is in fact no overview of how 
widely the integrated approach is followed; it is not known how many municipalities have 
adopted a chain approach to human trafficking, what similarities and differences there are 
between them and how effective they are.

A care coordinator for victims of human trafficking is sorely missed in various police regions.

15.8 Investigation

15.8.1 Policy and organisation

In practice, police forces do not all give the necessary priority to human trafficking. The Ref-
erence Framework on Human Trafficking (2008) published by the police’s National Human 
Trafficking Expert Group (LEM) contains useful guidelines for the police in how to handle 
human-trafficking cases and it is highly recommended that all forces adopt these guidelines. 
However, it is unclear whether and how the forces can be obliged to do so. This subject may 
be addressed in the next Police Force Monitor on Prostitution and Trafficking in Human 
Beings (2009/2010).

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   578 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

579

The various forces share information about their strategies and policies in the LEM. Since 
2007, meetings of the LEM have not been attended by experts from all the forces but only 
by a select few (alternately with and without external partners). As a result, the LEM is in 
danger of losing its usefulness in prompting and motivating police forces.

15.8.2 Identifying and investigating signs

It is often difficult to identify victims of human trafficking as such. It is in any case impor-
tant that any visible signs of human trafficking are spotted. It is quite possible that this does 
not always happen, but it is unclear on what scale. To identify signs of human trafficking 
properly it is important that both members of the public and employees in every level of 
organisations that may be confronted with human trafficking (including the police) know 
what it involves, can recognise victims and know how to act on a suspicion of human traf-
ficking. That situation has not been reached yet. There is still room for improvement in the 
capacity of various agencies, including municipalities, the IND, chambers of commerce, the 
police, doctors, operators of sex establishments, social workers and others to identify signs 
of human trafficking.

There are many different manifestations of human trafficking (including sexual exploitation, 
non-sexual exploitation and the loverboy problem). Each of them requires, partially at least, 
a different approach. Efforts to address human trafficking outside the sex industry in par-
ticular are still in their infancy and call, in some cases, for a change of attitude on the part of 
the relevant organisations (aliens police, the IND and the Ministry of Justice’s Repatriation 
and Departure Service (DT&V)). It is still not universally accepted that very serious forms 
of human trafficking can also occur in sectors outside the sex industry and that just as much 
priority should be devoted to identifying and investigating them. The police forces constant-
ly have to make choices in establishing priorities. The decision on where to deploy capacity 
is not always made in favour of tackling human trafficking. The administrative supervision 
of the prostitution industry also requires manpower and is not always – as has been agreed 
– facilitated by municipalities. The result is that some warnings of human trafficking are not 
investigated and investigations are dropped.

Many police forces have formed specialist teams to investigate human trafficking, but other 
divisions (such as the regional criminal investigation teams) also conduct investigations. It is 
evident that they sometimes lack knowledge and expertise of human trafficking. In regions 
without a specialist human-trafficking team, information about human trafficking is not al-
ways gathered properly and investigations seem to be more difficult to conduct. Detectives 
trained in dealing with human-trafficking cases are not always available to hear complaints.
It is not only identifying victims of human trafficking that is difficult, but also securing their 
cooperation with investigations and prosecutions. Victims are unwilling to report offences 
and their reports sometimes contain very few leads for an investigation. For successful inves-
tigations it is also important to use alternative solutions and strategies, such as accumulating 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   579 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

580

evidence from other sources. As stated in the Instructions on Human Trafficking, all investi-
gating teams should include detectives specialising in financial crime.

Human trafficking is always a local phenomenon but is frequently organised by international 
gangs. Cooperation with the police in other countries is therefore vital but little is known about 
this. There are also problems with international cooperation, for example because of differ-
ences in legal systems and interests. International cooperation is also very time-consuming.

15.8.3 Information and follow-up

It is important for the investigation of human trafficking to make use of information avail-
able to other partners in the chain, although naturally the provisions of the Personal Data 
Protection Act have to be observed. Nevertheless, the sharing of information seems to raise 
various obstacles for investigations into human trafficking. Some of these barriers are tech-
nical in nature and relate, for example, to computer systems. But others can be traced to at-
titudes. These obstacles must be removed as far as possible in view of the importance of the 
information and the need to share it.

The EMM, which acts as the national repository of information about human trafficking 
provided by all of the agencies involved in its supervision, control and investigation and in 
providing assistance to victims, does not function satisfactorily. On the one hand not all of 
the information is supplied, and on the other the information that is available is not prop-
erly analysed and processed. The disappointing output then undermines the motivation to 
provide information. The Human Trafficking Task Force commissioned a study into the ex-
change of information between police forces and the EMM. The resulting report, ‘Trade; 
you’ll pay for this’, led to the decision to start a pilot project with the Regional Information 
and Expertise Centres (RIECs) in Rotterdam and Groningen designed to improve the flow 
of information between the RIECs and the EMM.

The importance of the exchange of information between international police forces is grow-
ing all the time. By merging and analysing operational information from different countries 
it is possible to learn more about the methods used by human traffickers and how they are 
tackled. In the EU this is a task for Europol but the exchange of information through Eu-
ropol is not optimal. The Netherlands can play its part by adhering to the agreements on the 
provision of information to Europol.

15.8.4 Victims

The police naturally have a duty of care towards any victims of human trafficking they en-
counter during investigations. The victims must be given shelter. A practical problem fac-
ing the police is the shortage of places in (suitable) shelters and the occasional difficulty of 
reaching the relevant aid agencies. The police are also required to clearly inform victims of 
their options and their rights and to give them the opportunity to report the offence. There 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   580 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

581

are quite a few indications that victims who wish to report an offence are not always given 
the opportunity to do so by the police and that victims are not kept properly informed of 
progress with the police investigation.

15.9 Suspects and perpetrators

15.9.1	 Striking	figures

Dutch people comprised (in 2007) the largest group of suspects (95 out of 280 suspects) 
and the largest group of convicted persons (24 out of 73 convicted human traffickers). This 
illustrates once more that human trafficking does not necessarily have an international di-
mension. Interestingly, 30% of the suspects and 28% of convicted perpetrators were not in 
custody at the time of their trial.

15.9.2 Loverboy method

Human traffickers are quick to adapt their methods in response to changing circumstances or 
a crack down by the government. The so-called loverboy method provides an example of this. 
The popular image of a young man seducing vulnerable young Dutch girls into forming such 
a deep commitment that he can then get them to work in prostitution for him is no longer so 
clear cut. The practice is no longer confined to young men, nor exclusively to vulnerable young 
girls nor even only to seduction techniques; the methods are also used in transnational human 
trafficking and in exploitation outside the sex industry. The changeability of human traffick-
ing practices calls for an awareness of the changes that can occur in the group of victims. It is 
regrettable that it is not possible to derive sufficient information from the data of the public 
prosecution service about the extent to which loverboy methods are used.

15.9.3 Facilitators

Efforts to tackle human trafficking depend not only on receiving signals from individuals and 
agencies that are, coincidentally or otherwise, confronted with human trafficking. Another 
important factor is that numerous individuals and institutions consciously or unconsciously 
assist human trafficking by directly or indirectly facilitating it. In the well-known Sneep case, 
a ‘consultancy firm’ handled the defendants’ administrative affairs and a real estate company 
organised cars, mobile phones and accommodation. Doctors performed breast enlarge-
ments and abortions. Tattooists applied tattoos to the women involved.1

Professional groups that may become entangled with organised crime include taxi drivers, 
lawyers, civil-law notaries, employees of travel agencies and hotels and builders of websites. 
Culpable involvement in the narrow sense (intentional) occurs rarely, by contrast with the 

1 KLPD, Schone Schijn [Keeping up Appearances] (2008).

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   581 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

582

failure to observe standards of care (culpable involvement in the wider sense). Besides these 
private parties, employees of social services, municipalities, chambers of commerce, the 
IND, the Labour Inspectorate, the tax authorities and the police can also play a role.

The so-called barrier model could be used to explore ways of removing the basic conditions 
for human trafficking, while at the same time identifying the conscious and unconscious 
facilitators.

15.9.4 Internet

A special effort is needed to devise methods of preventing the many possibilities that the Inter-
net affords to human traffickers to commit their offences while easily avoiding detection.

15.9.5 Pekari and Koolvis

The Pekari project and the ensuing Koolvis case were innovative in several respects. For ex-
ample, the scale of the international cooperation was unprecedented and for the first time 
there was successful cooperation with the country of origin of the perpetrators and the vic-
tims (through the organisation NAPTIP). This probably ensured that the entire criminal or-
ganisation was identified rather than just a part of the organisation that could be replaced. 
Furthermore, the cultural context in which human trafficking in Nigeria occurs was antici-
pated by employing the services of a Nigerian priest. However, the ‘waterbed effect’ remains 
a persistent problem in human trafficking, in Nigeria and elsewhere. Human-trafficking or-
ganisations do not recognise borders so cross-border cooperation is essential if they are to 
be tackled effectively.

15.10 The Public Prosecution Service and prosecutions

The public prosecution service has been very ambitious in its use of criminal law to tackle 
human trafficking in recent years. However, human-trafficking cases do not automatically 
reach the public prosecution service. To realise its ambitions, the public prosecution service 
must actively pursue cases. This is why human trafficking is one of the areas in which the 
public prosecution service has decided to intensify its policy. In the new regions established 
by the public prosecution service prosecutors have been appointed who can devote 50% of 
their time to human-trafficking cases. These regional officers will also have a role in securing 
human-trafficking cases. The Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Offences 
recently assigned the human-trafficking portfolio to a prosecutor and an advocate-general 
has also been assigned the human-trafficking portfolio. Coordination on cases in the public 
prosecution service takes place in the ‘portfolio owners meeting’.

Aspects that demand attention are the need to safeguard continuity in the public prosecution 
service, especially where there is a rapid turnover among the specialist officers, and to ensure 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   582 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

583

there is sufficient capacity. There still seems to be too little time in terms of practical imple-
mentation. It is important that there is sufficient expertise and capacity at the local level to 
support the regional officers.

The Instructions on Human Trafficking were amended and clarified on several points on 1 
January 2009.

Since 2005, exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry and certain activities relating to 
the removal of organs have also been made criminal offences under the heading of ‘human traf-
ficking’. It has therefore become relevant to gather statistics on the occurence of these forms of 
offence. The text of article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code makes it impossible to distil this 
information from the OM data on the individual sections and subsections of that article. What 
is known is that several cases in 2006 and 2007 involved exploitation in sectors other than the 
sex industry and that no cases involving the removal of organs have yet been brought.

In 2007, 61% of the prosecutions for human trafficking led to a conviction for at least human 
trafficking. Between 2003 and 2007, there was a noticeable downward trend in the number 
of unconditional prison sentences of more than four years. This trend seems to contradict 
the growing political awareness of the seriousness of human trafficking, which led among 
other things to the raising of the sentences from 1 July 2009.

For the first time, this report presents the data on appeals. Of the 265 appeals heard in cases 
involving human trafficking between 1997 and 2007, the defendants were convicted wholly 
or partially for human trafficking in 237 cases (89%). Over the entire period, a prison sen-
tence of more than four years was imposed in 19% of the appeals. In 5% of the cases in first 
instance in 2007 prison sentences of more than four years were imposed.

The figures presented in Chapter 10 relate to the public prosecution service’s performance 
in a particular period (2003-2007). A constraint of this system is that it provides no insight 
into how cases were handled from beginning to end. A cohort analysis should therefore be 
conducted to provide this information.

The Council for the Judiciary is considering the question of whether cases of a particular 
type should be concentrated in specific courts. Human trafficking is one of the areas men-
tioned in this context.

15.11 Case law concerning exploitation in the sex industry

Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code is not a straightforward article. It is multilayered. 
The history of international treaties and knowledge of the methods used by perpetrators and 
the problems facing victims are also relevant for the interpretation and application of this 
provision.

The investigation into Dutch case law on human trafficking in the sex industry shows dis-
crepancies in how various legal aspects are interpreted and a lack of uniformity in the evalu-

ation of the context of violence, coercion, deception and the possibility for victims to escape 
from their situation. Statements by victims, and above all their internal consistency, play an 
important role in weighing the evidence. It is noteworthy in this context that judges some-
times actively look for an explanation for inconsistencies in the statements by victims. This 
suggests that in these cases the judges have recognised the specific problems associated with 
the statements of victims in human-trafficking cases. The impression to emerge from the 
almost 200 judgments since January 2007 that were studied is that even where there is a find-
ing that coercion has been proved, the Dutch prostitution policy sometimes seems to play 
a role in the evaluation of whether a victim could reasonably have made a different choice. 
This is perhaps explicable on the grounds of the explanatory memorandum of the original 
proposal for article 273a of the (old) Dutch Criminal Code, in which the comparison was 
made with the ‘articulate Dutch prostitute’. However, this comparison can only refer to the 
situation where the prostitute is already working in prostitution and cannot be a factor in 
assessing the ‘freedom of choice’ to enter prostitution. The number of acquittals in human-
trafficking cases is high, even by comparison with the number of acquittals in rape cases for 
example. Contrary to what might be expected, the study showed that this is only partially 
due to the absence of reliable statements by victims and witnesses.

For some years now there has been talk of establishing a training course on human traffick-
ing. The Training and Study Centre for the Judiciary (SSR) has already produced a basic 
and an advanced course. The original idea was for a course made up of six modules covering 
international legislation, the immigration law background, the social context and the legal 
problems and concluding with a professional forum. The course has not yet been launched, 
however, and judges only sporadically attend the existing courses.

There is no specialisation in human trafficking in the judiciary, although the public prosecu-
tion service has now started appointing specialist regional public prosecutors.

The number of human-trafficking cases brought before the district courts annually has 
ranged from 100 to 150 in the last few years. The accumulation and retention of sufficient 
specialist knowledge and expertise is not promoted by allocating them among nineteen 
courts. The creation and retention of expertise would be enhanced by concentrating human-
trafficking cases in a single court.

BNRM study showed a variation in both the sentences demanded and the sentences imposed 
in human-trafficking cases. There seems to be a need for guidelines. Basic principles for the 
appropriate sentence for human trafficking were formulated for the first time in the Sneep 
case. These were a prison sentence of eight to ten months for each victim, depending on the 
duration of the exploitation, the level of violence used and the role of the suspect. In that con-
text, a period of exploitation of nine months was regarded as ‘relatively short’. Interestingly, 
aggravating circumstances are seldom explicitly mentioned either by the public prosecution 
service in the indictment or by the judge in the particulars of the offence. BNRM’s study 
did not encompass provisional custody. What the judgments did show is that 30% of the

Summary

585

defendants and 28% of those convicted were not being held in custody at the time of the trial. 
BNRM intends to study this subject in more depth.

Studying the judgments in criminal trials yields a lot of information. For example, most of the 
judgments in 2007 involved human trafficking cases in which victims were forced to work in 
prostitution in the Netherlands. Almost three-quarters of the convicted perpetrators were 
pimps. Half were involved in recruiting victims and 35% escorted victims to the Netherlands 
from other countries. Roughly a quarter had to guard the victims and slightly fewer than a fifth 
were responsible for transporting the victims to and from the workplace. A minority of the per-
petrators, 5%, operated a sex business. These perpetrators often performed several different 
roles. It is impossible to tell whether the sex businesses were licensed, unlicensed or illegal.

The judgments that were studied show that it is particularly difficult for victims to secure 
compensation for material damage. This is often loss of income. In the majority of the judg-
ments these claims (or this part of the claim) were felt to be too complicated and the victims’ 
claims were declared inadmissible. Nevertheless, a slight change has been apparent in the 
more recent judgments, particularly when a financial report has been prepared for the claim 
for the confiscation of illegally obtained profits and it is available at the time of the trial. A 
problem, however, is that the claim for confiscation of criminal assets is often not raised at 
the time of the main trial. There is room for improvement there. The financial report could 
also be submitted to the judge for the purposes of the decision on the injured party’s claim. 
Finally, the injured party’s claim, submitted for the hearing of the main trial, could also be 
adjourned to be dealt with at the same time as the later claim for confiscation of criminal as-
sets. The law would have to be amended to allow this.

The study of the case law shows that in cases where the court declares that attempted human 
trafficking has been proved the offence was in fact committed. Scarcely any prosecutions for ‘at-
tempted human trafficking’ as such were found. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence of the Supreme 
Court on attempted human trafficking does provide scope to press this charge more often.

A successful prosecution at an earlier stage could have a preventive effect.

15.12 Exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

15.12.1	 Identification	and	perception	of	exploitation	in	other	sectors

Growing attention is being devoted to identifying forms of exploitation outside the sex in-
dustry. For example, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment produced a fact sheet 
entitled ‘Labour and Exploitation’ to raise awareness among potential victims. However, al-
though Dutch legislation makes no distinction between sexual and other forms of exploita-
tion, in practice there are differences in how they are identified, investigated, prosecuted and 
tried. These discrepancies are mainly related to the perception and recognition of situations 
of other forms of exploitation. The impression is that other forms of exploitation are seen as 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   585 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

586

‘less serious’ than sexual exploitation. In principle, the seriousness of the exploitation does 
not depend on the sector in which it occurs.

It also seems that care for victims of other forms of exploitation creates or could create prac-
tical problems, especially since the numbers involved are sometimes substantial. Victims of 
other forms of exploitation are not always reported to CoMensha.

Other forms of exploitation obviously occur and every relevant actor should therefore re-
spond adequately to excesses.

15.12.2 Investigation and prosecution of other forms of exploitation

In practice, however, investigative agencies still know relatively little about the problem of 
other forms of exploitation. There is no clear picture of the scale of the problem, the condi-
tions under which people are forced to work and the extent to which criminal organisations are 
involved. The other forms of exploitation are described as a ‘blank spot’ in the National Threat 
Assessment 2008. The relevant agencies (the Labour Inspectorate, the Social Intelligence and 
Investigation Service (SIOD), the police) do not always notify one another of indications of 
exploitation. The Labour Inspectorate only occasionally reports signs to the SIOD. Further-
more, combinations of different indications of exploitation are not always recognised as poten-
tial instances of human trafficking. The circumstances are more usually regarded as a series of 
isolated instances of breaches of labour and administrative law. Because the various agencies 
fail to make the connection between the various events, either internally or through consulta-
tion with other agencies, they fail to see them as a possible case of exploitation.

The public prosecution service’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Offenc-
es does not always act on information from investigations or does not always conduct an 
investigation into human trafficking, even though the public prosecution service has made 
human trafficking a priority. The failure to act on indications of human trafficking is also 
connected with the fact that the scope of the element ‘exploitation’ has not yet been clearly 
defined in case law. This makes it difficult for investigative services and the public prosecu-
tion service to assess which situations the courts will regard as human trafficking.

The public prosecution service has started a pilot project to encourage the adoption of the 
integrated approach towards other forms of exploitation with the police in the Zuid-Hol-
land-Zuid region.

Training courses in human trafficking have been provided for employees of various depart-
ments in the Labour Inspectorate. The SIOD has made the fight against other forms of ex-
ploitation a priority and it recently established an internal ‘Programme to improve efforts to 
tackle human trafficking’.

Certification of SIOD investigators had not yet been introduced when this report was written. 
Although working-conditions inspectors can also come across evidence of human trafficking, 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   586 09-06-10   00:13



Summary

587

such as poor working conditions, the responsible division of the Labour Inspectorate has also 
not yet received any training in identifying human trafficking. On the other hand, Aliens Em-
ployment Act inspectors and the Labour Market Fraud inspectors have received training.

15.12.3 The text of the law

Not for the first time, the question has arisen of whether the text of article 273f of the Dutch 
Criminal Code should be amended to clarify the scope of other forms of exploitation. The 
text of the law is certainly not straightforward. One reason for this is that the text is taken 
almost verbatim from international provisions. The explanatory memorandum to article 
273f of the Dutch Criminal Code provides little help for the courts, to whom further inter-
pretation was consciously left. A survey of the legislation and case law in a number of other 
countries shows that the legal practice in those countries faces similar problems and that the 
legislation in the various countries, although always based on the Palermo Protocol, differs 
in certain respects. Countries in which forms of exploitation outside the sex industry have 
long been punishable (such as Belgium and the US) have meanwhile gained a lot of experi-
ence in prosecuting these forms of human trafficking. Judges in the Netherlands could per-
haps learn from similar cases abroad. An international database of judicial rulings might be 
a solution. Amending the act would not solve the problems relating to the interpretation and 
appreciation of what constitutes other forms of exploitation.

15.12.4 Case law on exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry

Although the scope of the offence of human trafficking involving forms of exploitation in 
sectors other than the sex industry has not yet been clearly defined in case law, a number of 
trends have emerged in the jurisprudence. Three of the twelve cases involving these forms of 
exploitation to date have led to convictions for human trafficking. In the judgments studied, 
the elements most often found not to have been proved were (the intention of) exploitation and 
coercion through ‘abuse of a vulnerable position’. It is possible that the workplace (behind the 
front door or at a business location that is part of the formal economy) and the degree to which 
the relationship between the perpetrator and victim is commercial influence where the judge 
draws the line between bad employership and exploitation. It is also possible that convincing 
evidence of exploitation is easier to supply if the victim’s bodily integrity is violated by physical 
violence than by, for example, physically harmful work or an exhausting working regime.

As regards the criterion that the victim does not or does not reasonably feel that he or she 
is free to escape from the working situation, the subjective perception of a lack of liberty 
raised complications in a number of judgments. Judges still seem to deal differently with the 
question of whether the worker had a reasonable alternative to becoming involved in this 
situation of exploitation. Judges in other countries seem to be more willing to assume that 
the victim had no real alternative to working for the exploiter.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

588

In four of the twelve cases studied in the Netherlands the victims/employees were involved 
in criminal offences closely related to the situation of exploitation. In two of these cases the 
victims were prosecuted for those offences. This fact is interesting in the context of the pos-
sibilities provided by the non-punishment principle (see Chapter 6). In the two judgments 
that led to acquittal on charges of human trafficking, the court, in finding that that there was 
no question of exploitation, did mention the criminal nature of the work, but it was not ap-
parent from the judgment that the court had attached any weight to the fact that the work the 
workers had to perform was punishable.

In half of the cases that were examined, according to the indictment sexual services were also 
performed by the employees/victims. One case involved commercial sexual services with a 
third party; in the five other cases the employees/victims were sexually abused by the defend-
ants themselves. The question that arises is whether the performance, under compulsion, 
of sexual services with a single person, outside the sex industry, can fall within the scope of 
article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code. No court has yet ruled on this issue. A similar dis-
cussion has arisen in Belgium.

Practice also seems to confirm that there is an increased risk of exploitation in certain forms 
of ethnic entrepreneurship and that exploitation also occurs within relationships and/or 
families. There is little certainty about the extent to which cultural background can be taken 
into account in a judgment in a case involving other forms of exploitation.

15.12.5 Risk sectors and risk groups of other forms of exploitation

Several groups at risk of other forms of exploitation are discussed in Chapter 12. What 
stands out is that people from Central and Eastern European countries and people living 
illegally in the Netherlands often work through male fide employment agencies. This makes 
them vulnerable to exploitation. Although certified employment agencies are guilty of fewer 
abuses than non-certified companies, the percentage is still relatively high. This is therefore 
another area of concern.

Domestic staff employed by diplomats face an additional risk of exposure to exploitation be-
cause the immunity of diplomats complicates prosecution in the event of abuses. The Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs has taken various steps to improve the position of the domestic staff 
of diplomats. For example, domestic workers are given instructions, which include pointers 
on human trafficking. The instructions are given verbally. There is no written information, 
such as telephone numbers of social workers, the police or the ministry. A domestic worker 
is therefore perhaps unable to contact the appropriate agencies if he or she experiences a 
situation of exploitation.

Exploitation within marriage is another area of attention. There are no details available on 
its nature and scale.

15.13	 Human	trafficking	with	a	view	to	organ	removal

There is interest in the subject of organ removal in the Netherlands. The news media regu-
larly report on it. It is also an important topic at the international level. There is scarcely any 
information about the actual occurrence of the phenomenon in the Netherlands. The Fifth 
Report of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings already noted the ur-
gency of remaining alert. That still applies.

For example, there is evidence that persons from the Netherlands travel to organ-exporting 
countries. With a view to possible abuses in relation to human trafficking it is important for 
facilitating, support and executive agencies, such as medical personnel and health insurers, 
to remain alert to the origins of organs for organ donations, particularly in the case of medi-
cal tourism.

Further research into the trade in bodily organs, organ tourism and human trafficking with 
a view to organ removal in the Netherlands may be helpful in this regard.
In her letter concerning the policy on Ethics on 7 September 2007, the State Secretary for 
Health, Welfare and Sport stated that she intended to ratify the Council of Europe’s Bio-
medical Convention. This has not yet been done.

Explanation of research methods used

For this report, BNRM conducted its own research on a number of subjects. This appen-
dix explains the objectives of the research, the research questions and the research methods 
used. The subjects studied were:
Criminal case law on exploitation in the sex industry
1. Criminal case law on exploitation outside the sex industry
2. The non-punishment principle
3. Shelved cases
4. The PPS data research
5. Information about the B9 regulation
6. Possible abuse of the B9 regulation
7. Objections pursuant to Article 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure
8. Continued residence

1. Criminal case law on exploitation in the sex industry

Objective and research questions
The aim of this research was to acquire a more complete picture of recent Dutch case law on 
human trafficking in the sex industry. Case law on exploitation in other sectors (‘other forms 
of exploitation’) is not covered.1

A number of subjects were studied in more depth’, including the assessment of judges of the 
reliability of the statements made by victims, the grounds for sentencing, the sentences and 
compensation claimed by and awarded to victims.
The research questions were formulated as follows:

 – what factors play a role in deciding whether a statement by a witness is or is not reliable?
 – how is human trafficking punished and what reasons are given for the sentences im-

posed?

Research method
The study embraced a quantitative and a qualitative element. The quantitative part of the 
study covered only judgments rendered in first instance in 2007. The qualitative part encom-
passed all judgments rendered since then that have been published on www.rechtspraak.nl. 
With the cooperation of the LOVS, BNRM received all judgments rendered in 2007 that 
had not been anonymised. A so called ‘LJN’ number is given for all judgments that were also 
published on www.rechtspraak.nl.

1 On this point, see Chapter 12.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   595 09-06-10   00:13



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

596

To answer the research questions, BNRM studied the 108 judgments in first instance in 
2007, as well as the judgments that were published on www.rechtspraak.nl from 2007 up to 
and including 30 June 2009. This was a total of 184 rulings, including judgments of appeal 
courts and the Supreme Court.2

The quantitative analysis is limited to judgments in first instance in 2007. This approach was 
chosen because BNRM had access to all judgments rendered in first instance in 2007, as 
was shown by a comparison with the public prosecution service’s national database, which 
contains information about the prosecution of suspects from the 19 district offices.3 The da-
taset for the quantitative analysis was a collection of 108 judgments in criminal cases against 
suspects of human trafficking in the sex industry.
According to the data from the public prosecution service in the Netherlands, in 2007 the 
courts dealt with 120 criminal cases involving human trafficking in first instance (see Chap-
ter 10). BNRM ignored 12 criminal cases for this study, for example because a number of 
cases involved human trafficking relating to other, non-sexual, forms of exploitation.4 The 
quantitative part of the study is therefore based on 108 judgments rendered in human traf-
ficking cases relating to sexual exploitation.

Reservations about the quantitative part of this study
The quantitative part of the study sketches a single year of human-trafficking case law; it 
covers judgments rendered in first instance by the district courts in 2007. Not all of the 108 
judgements that were analysed are, or were at the time of the study, final and irrevocable.
The 108 judgments do not necessarily involve 108 different cases of human trafficking or sets 
of facts. On a particular date, the same district court might have rendered judgment in hu-
man trafficking cases against different defendants who were involved in the same set of facts. 
In that sense, there were ultimately 65 different human trafficking cases, involving between 
one and seven suspects, and a total of 108 suspects.
Not all district courts rendered judgments in a human trafficking case in 2007. The 108 judg-
ments studied were rendered by 13 district courts.5

In the quantitative part of the study, facts are noted insofar as they were explicitly mentioned 
in the judgments. Consequently, the absence of a factor or a fact in a judgment does not nec-
essarily mean that the judge did not take it into account.

2 These are 108 judgment rendered by district courts in 2007, seven judgments of appeal courts and the Su-
preme Court in 2007 that were published on rechtspraak.nl, and 69 judgments of district courts and appeal 
courts from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2009 that were published on rechtspraak.nl.

3 It also showed that one judgment received by BNRM was not included in the PPS data: Groningen District 
Court, 3 April 2007 (unpublished).

4 For the purpose of the analyses, 12 criminal case were ultimately ignored for the following reasons: seven 
cases concerned human trafficking in relation to other, non-sexual exploitation; one case concerned people 
smuggling rather than human trafficking; and one case was not heard because the PPS was declared inadmis-
sible. Three case were joined with other cases at the hearing; the substance of the judgments is included but 
they are not counted separately, so these three cases are not to found in the figures.

5 The district courts in Assen, Breda, Dordrecht, Maastricht, Roermond and Zutphen rendered no judgments 
in human trafficking cases in 2007.

The 108 judgments that were analysed fall into one of the following categories: abridged 
judgments – with or without grounds for conviction or acquittal –, abridged judgments with

2. Criminal case law concerning exploitation outside the sex industry

Objective and research questions
The study into case law concerning other forms of exploitation was divided into two parts. 
First, all Dutch case law relating to other forms of exploitation was studied and analysed. Also 
was examined how other countries deal with the prosecution of other forms of exploitation.
The aim of the study of Dutch case law was to gain an impression of the development of the 
jurisprudence and identify the problems relating to the prosecution of human trafficking 
outside the sex industry. On the basis of the identified problems, was then analysed how oth-
er countries have criminalised human trafficking, where problems arise in the prosecution 
of the offence in other countries and how they could be solved. The aim of the comparative 
international legal survey was to learn what legislation other countries have adopted with 
respect to other forms of exploitation and how that legislation is applied by the courts.

Research method
All of the judgments concerning other forms of exploitation that have rendered up to now 
in the Netherlands were studied (see §12.6). In most cases, the public prosecutor’s closing 
speech, the pleadings, the record of the court proceedings and the summons were also stud-
ied. A number of hearings were also attended and in a few cases the public prosecutor or 
judge was interviewed.

6 Two of these judgments also contained a separate finding with the evidence.

Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

598

The countries selected for the international comparative survey was based in part on the fact 
that – like the Netherlands – they are parties to the UN Palermo Protocol and/or are bound 
by the EU Framework Decision (2002). Both instruments require countries to criminalise 
human trafficking on the basis of similar definitions. This part of the survey covered Bel-
gium, France, Norway and the United States.
In the international comparative survey the place of the criminalisation of other forms of 
exploitation in the national legislation was reviewed and was investigated which forms of 
human trafficking are included in national legislation. Also the definitions of offences relat-
ing to other forms of exploitation were studied. Where possible, a number of judgments in 
cases involving other forms of exploitation in each country was studied and analysed, with 
the emphasis on aspects that had caused prosecutions to fail in the Netherlands, such as the 
definition of the component (intention of) exploiting and the (coercive) means of the misuse 
of a vulnerable position. Various experts in the different countries were consulted by tel-
ephone and e-mail for an explanation of the interpretation of judgments and legislation. The 
information about legislation and case law in the US is largely based on research carried out 
by Anje van Delden at BNRM’s request.

Reservations to the study
The international comparative survey was not intended to provide a comprehensive over-
view of international case law. By studying legislation and a number of judgments, an at-
tempt was made to indicate how courts in other countries deal with possible problems in 
some areas. One criterion used to select countries was the availability of judgments in Eng-
lish, French and German. The selection made might mean that interesting legislation and 
case law in other countries has been ignored. The fact that no judgments at all were available 
from Germany and the United Kingdom meant that these countries were not covered in the 
study. BNRM was only able to secure a very small number of judgments from France and 
Norway.7 This was connected with the fact that little or no use has been made of the central 
articles on human trafficking in the legislation of these countries in recent years. In addition, 
judgments in these countries are not published and available. Requests for judgments from 
agencies in these countries ultimately proved difficult. For the description of case law in a 
number of countries, therefore, some secondary sources in the sense of comparative legal 
surveys, were used. The ILO’s Casebook of Court Decisions in 2009 was useful for France, 
although it does not include the precise terms of the court judgements.8

Part of the survey of Belgian case law was taken from the annual report of the Centre for 
Equal Opportunities and Anti-Racism, which has also published a number of (original) 
judgments on its website that were used for this exploratory study. A drawback of making 

7 According to the Trafficking in Persons Report 2009, there was one case in Norway concerning other forms 
of exploitation. Three cases were studied for France: Cour de Cassation Chambre criminelle, 3 decembre 2002, 
N de Decision: 97/8641, ECHR – Siliadin versus France (which was reported on in NRM5) and Cour d’appel 
Poitiers, 26 fevrier 2001, N de pourvoi: 02-81453 (Procureur de la Republique v. Monsieur B.)

such a pre-is that it can give a distorted impression. Third, it is unclear what influence these 
judgments will have on future exploitation cases in Norway and France. Another obstacle 
is the Norwegian language. In this chapter, an unofficial English translation of the texts of 
the law made by the University of Bergen was used , which was approved by the Norwegian 
Ministry of Justice.9 A drawback of this is that some English equivalents of Norwegian legal 
terms are more an approximation than a precise translation.10

3. The non-punishment principle

Objective
To gain an impression of the nature of the problems facing victims who are also perpetrators 
of criminal offences connected with the human trafficking situation, BNRM investigated 
cases in the Netherlands and abroad. BNRM also studied national and international legisla-
tion and literature to explore the possibilities of the non-punishment principle. The aim was 
to use the results to describe the problems and recommend solutions.

Research method
Besides studying national and international legislation and literature, BNRM looked for 
cases. In the Netherlands, the cases were acquired from the police, social services, the legal 
profession and the public prosecution service. Most of the information was retrieved from 
written documents such as official reports of the police and judicial rulings. The cases stud-
ied were also explained verbally by the person who had brought the case.
The cases in other countries were acquired through personal interviews with the public pros-
ecution service, the police, NGOs and other relevant organisations. Most cases in the com-
parative legal survey came only from a verbal source, without underlying documentation. 
The information on legislation in the various countries came from the interviews, supported 
by a study of the text of the law and additional documents. For the study of the problems in 
other countries, it was decided to focus on neighbouring European countries. Because the 
role of the legality principle plays a fairly prominent role in the international debate about 
the non-punishment principle, three countries (Germany, Italy and Austria) in which pros-
ecution is based on that principle were studied. The selection of countries was also based 
on the fact that some countries have already ratified the Convention of the Council Europe 
(2005), which contains a legally binding provision on the non-punishment principle.
We wish to express our special thanks to interviewees in the Netherlands and abroad who 
provided these cases for us.

600

Reservations to the study
The study was not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of cases in which victims 
of human trafficking were involved in the commission of criminal offences. That is also not 
possible, since there is no agency in the Netherlands or in other countries that keeps records 
of all victims who are involved in a criminal offence. Because the cases often came from a 
single source, much of the information was provided verbally and a lot of information was 
not recorded in writing by the organisations from which the information came, it is possible 
that the descriptions of the cases do not all give a complete and faithful account of the events. 
However, this does not detract from the objective of the survey, which was to provide an in-
sight into the nature of the problems facing victims who are also offenders.
To find respondents for the interviews in the various countries, BNRM attempted, in any 
case, to interview respondents in the public prosecution service and NGOs in each coun-
try. However, in Germany, only one public prosecutor was interviewed and no respondents 
from NGOs were available. There was no response to requests for interviews from Sweden. 
For this reason, it was decided not to include Sweden in the study. A number of respondents 
were interviewed in the other countries. It has to be noted that every respondent has a per-
sonal view of the problems, which could colour the information.

4. Shelved cases

Introduction
For years BNRM has been hearing of human trafficking cases that were not or could not be 
dealt with by the police, so-called ‘shelved cases’.11 Reasons given for this include a lack of re-
sources and the failure to give priority to human trafficking. An unknown number of shelved 
cases are eventually dropped because the time limit for prosecuting them has lapsed. This 
information from the police, the public prosecution service and the social services, among 
others, led us to conduct this study.

Objective
To gain an insight into the number and nature of human trafficking cases shelved by the 
police.

Research questions
Questions about indications of human trafficking received by the police:

 – What indications were received during a period of two months?
 – Which of these indications contained leads for an investigation?

11 Shelved cases are cases that are not dealt with immediately. However, there is not yet a clear definition of 
shelved cases. Police offices use the term in different ways. In this study, the term shelved cases refers to 
indications that do provide sufficient leads for an investigation but are not followed up or do not lead to an 
investigation. A case can be shelved at various stages of an investigation.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   600 09-06-10   00:14



Appendix 2

601

Questions about the timing of decisions:
 – What indications do or do not lead to follow-up action, and what action is taken?
 – What factors are taken into consideration?
 – Where and how is the decision made?
 – How are decisions taken on whether to start or continue an investigation?

Questions about how efforts to tackle human trafficking are organised:
 – How are efforts to tackle human trafficking organised within the region?

Research method
For practical reasons, eight police forces were selected for this study. The selection is not 
entirely representative of all police regions, but the regions were chosen to reflect various 
features and circumstances in different regions. For example, factors taken into account in 
the selection of the police forces were:

 – the number of indications of human trafficking received in 2006 (source: Police Force 
Monitor 2007 – underlying questionnaires). The selection included, in any case, one po-
lice forces with almost no indications of human trafficking and one force that was unable 
to provide this information;12

 – the number of indications that did or did not lead to an investigation (source: Police Force 
Monitor 2007 – underlying questionnaires);

 – the assessment of the approach to human trafficking (green, orange, red) (source: Police 
Force Monitor 2007);

 – the size and location of the police region.

The regions selected on the basis of these criteria were: Amsterdam-Amstelland, Gelder-
land-Midden, Groningen, Limburg-Noord, Noord-Holland-Noord, Rotterdam-Rijnmond, 
Twente and Zuid-Holland-Zuid.
The number of indications/complaints received by the selected police forces in the period 
from 1 January 2007 to 1 March 2007 (two months) was determined and the cases were ana-
lysed in terms of the nature of the indication and the existence of leads for investigation.13 
Then was examined which indications were dealt with (and how) and which were not, in-
cluding the times at which relevant decisions are made. What decision were made? Why was 
it decided to conduct an investigation or not? By whom?

12 This complies with a request from LEM (on 20 February 2008).
13 In principle, this was done with the relevant officials in the region. There may in fact be some debate about 

whether there are leads for an investigation. In those cases, the advice of an objective, external expert can be 
sought.

5. The PPS data research

Introduction
At BNRM’s request, analyses are carried out each year on part of the PPS national database 
devoted to ‘human trafficking’, which contains information provided by 19 district offices of 
the PPS about the prosecution of suspects.14 The analyses give an impression of the course of 
the proceedings in first instance. PPS data contain information about cases and offences. By 
contrast with police investigations, for the purpose of prosecution a (criminal) case is under-
stood to mean the case against a single suspect. Criminal cases against individual suspects 
may involve multiple offences. The results of the research are presented in Chapter 9 (Sus-
pects and offenders) and Chapter 10 (The Public Prosecution Service and prosecution).

Objective and research questions
The objective of the study was to provide insight into the prosecution of suspects of THB in 
the Netherlands. The research questions were:

 – How many cases relating to THB were registered with the PPS?
 – How often are under-age victims involved?
 – What is the breakdown of the suspects in terms of gender, age and country of origin?
 – What is the breakdown of persons convicted of THB in terms of gender, age and country 

of origin?
 – What offences other than THB are those persons suspected of?
 – How did the PPS deal with cases?
 – How did the courts settle cases?
 – How often do the various parties lodge an appeal against judgments of the court?
 – What trends have occurred over time with respect to THB?

Research method
The cases in which THB is registered (as one of the offences) were selected from the overall PPS 
database. The analyses do not follow a particular cohort. Instead, the analysis reviewed how 
many cases were registered and how many were dealt with by the PPS or settled by the courts.15

Additional remarks
The PPS data only include the principal charges in the indictment. Furthermore, if there are 
several principal offences in the charges only the first offence is registered in the PPS data.
This means not only that the PPS data provide only a limited impression of the total number 
of THB offences (namely that portion that comes to the attention of the police and is re-
ferred to the PPS) but also that the portion of the information that does reach the PPS and 
that may play a role in the course of the prosecution is not to be found in the PPS data. It is 
not known how much information may be lost in this way.

14 The analyses are carried out by the Statistical Data and Policy Analysis Division (SIBA) of the Ministry of 
Justice’s Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (WODC).

15 This means that they are not necessarily always the same cases.

6. B9 data

Objective and research questions
In principle, every year BNRM analyses the databases supplied by the IND containing the 
records of all applications for and awards of residence permits under the B9 regulation (B9 
residence permits). For various reasons, this report only covers the granting of permits. This 
decision is explained below, together with the research method.
The research questions are:

 – How many victims/witnesses were granted a B9 residence permit?
 – What are the (background) characteristics of persons with a B9 residence permit?
 – How many B9 residence permits were granted in each police region?

Research method
At BNRM’s request, the IND – the agency where requests for a residence permit under the 
B9 regulation are submitted – provided databases with records of all contacts in which the 
B9 regulation played a role. These databases contain records of all B9 residence permits that 
were granted (even if this was only done at a later stage, for example, after an objection or an 
appeal procedure and where a permit was granted on other grounds). BNRM aggregated all 
the files at a personal level.16 This database was further analysed. Because of omissions in the 
system, caused by the transfer of the administrative system for aliens to the IND, the report 
only covers the period from 2005 onwards.

Reservations to the study
Several additional reservations need to be expressed about the database used in the study. 
First, the IND does not consistently and/or uniformly register whether applications for and 
awards of residence permits are linked to the B9 regulation. Consequently, it can occur that a 
person who applies for a B9 residence permit is registered as receiving a residence permit on 
other grounds (for example ‘residence with partner’, or ‘working in the EU’). The reverse also 
occurs: persons who do not apply for a B9 residence permit but are granted one at the time 
of their first registration. Assuming that persons who were given a B9 classification either in 
the application or in the granting of a permit invoked the B9 regulation, all these persons are 
included in the analysis. Since the IND has no special procedure for automatically and manda-
torily registering an appeal to the B9 regulation as a ground for a residence permit, it is possible 
that not all victims who invoke the B9 regulation were traced (and included in the database).17

Second, the B9 regulation provides for a temporary residence permit for both victims and 
witnesses of human trafficking who make a complaint of human trafficking. The IND does 
not register whether a person receives a B9 residence permit as a victim or a witness. In fact, 

16 After all, a person can have more than one procedure with the IND, and have multiple contacts with the IND 
during each procedure.

17 Persons who were counted in this study could in fact have been categorised differently by the IND, because 
there were, at some point and possibly together with other grounds for residence, linked to B9 regulation, 
because the IND classifies persons according to the first mentioned purpose of residence.

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   603 09-06-10   00:14



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

604

a witness could just as easily be a victim, since it is clear from various sources (including Van 
Dijk, 2002) that victims of human trafficking are more likely to make a statement as a witness 
than a complaint as a victim.
Third, the B9 data only relate to victims and witnesses of human trafficking living illegally 
in the Netherlands, since only they need to have their residence in the Netherlands legalised 
for the purposes of the investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, the IND databases only 
contain details of persons who qualify for a temporary residence permit because they have 
made a complaint of human trafficking. Victims who are still making use of the reflection 
period are not registered by the IND.

7. Possible abuse of the B9 regulation

Introduction
Foreigners who have to leave the Netherlands or have no prospect of securing residence sta-
tus sometimes claim – at the last moment – to be victims of human trafficking or are recog-
nised as such, for example by lawyers or social workers. They make a complaint of human 
trafficking, but these complaints contain few if any leads and investigations based on them 
can therefore seldom be successfully completed. However, resources (sometimes consider-
able) have to be devoted to these cases, because according to the Instruction on Human Traf-
ficking they must be investigated. Some of those concerned suspect that the B9 regulation is 
abused in order to secure a temporary residence permit. BNRM has researched this problem 
and organised a (computer-supported) expert meeting to brainstorm on possible solutions.

Objective
To gain an insight into the factors that lead to suspicions of abuse of the B9 regulation and to 
explore possible solutions.

Research questions
Description of case:

 – How did the police become aware of the case?
 – What did the claim of human trafficking involve?
 – What was the previous history of the (possible) victim of human trafficking?
 – Were there indications of human trafficking in the victim’s previous history?
 – Were there leads for an investigation or indications of human trafficking?

Course of the case:
 – What follow-up actions were taken by the police?
 – How did the case end?
 – What was the role of the public prosecution service?
 – Were there omissions on the part of the police?

Doubts:
 – Why are there doubts or suspicions of abuse of the B9 regulation?
 – What were the effects of these doubts?
 – Solutions:
 – What possible solutions are there for dubious cases?

Research method
For this study, every case in which the police suspected abuse of the B9 regulation were ex-
amined. This produced 88 cases in 2007 and in 2008 in 13 police regions. Sixteen cases were 
selected at random to be studied in more detail. The following table shows the origin of the 
victims, their gender and the nature of the (planned) exploitation.

* In two cases, the complainant had not yet actually worked in the sex industry. The suspect had announced that this was the intention.

In 12 of the 16 cases, the complainants were from Africa (seven of them from Nigeria), in four 
the complaints were from China. The complainants included 14 women and two men. The 
research questions were answered for these 16 cases.

Expert meeting
BNRM organised an interactive, computer-supported expert meeting with 14 representa-
tives of the police, the public prosecution service, social services, the legal profession and the 
IND to further discuss the nature of the problem and to brainstorm on possible solutions. 
This meeting took place on 10 February 2009.

Additional research
Another six cases of former unaccompanied underage aliens who made complaints of human 
trafficking in 2006 were also studied. There were complaints from the social services about 
how these cases were handled. We therefore examined how these cases had been handled by 
the police and public prosecution service in accordance with the principle of hearing both 
sides: the social workers explained the complaints they had and the police then explained 
how the investigation was conducted and responded to the complaints. The social workers 
then gave their response. The descriptions of cases resulting from this study are included in 
this report where relevant. We also discussed cases they had complaints about with social 
workers at conferences and meetings.

8.  Objections pursuant to Article 12 of the Dutch Code of Criminal 
Procedure

Objective
The aim of the study was to gain an insight into:

 – the characteristics of human trafficking cases in which it was decided not to prosecute 
and against which decision an objection was made under Article 12 of the Dutch Code of 
Criminal Procedure;

 – the settlement of these cases.

Research method
For this study was looked at the judgments (final decisions) and underlying files of the Ar-
ticle 12 proceedings relating to human trafficking that were dealt with by three of the five 
appeal courts from 1 January 2007 and in which a decision was made before April 2009. The 
three selected appeal courts (Amsterdam, Den Bosch and The Hague) are considered to be 
representative of all five appeal courts.18 The judgments and files were analysed on the basis 
of a questionnaire.
This study encompassed a total of 44 judgments (final decisions).19 The following table gives 
a summary of the number of judgments of each appeal court that was studied, broken down 
by the year in which the objections were heard.20

Total 12 17 15 44

The length of the objection procedure from the time the notice of objection was received to 
the time the appeal court rendered judgement ranged from two and a half months to four-
teen months, and averaged nine, seven and a half and six months in Amsterdam, Den Bosch 
and The Hague respectively.

18 It is impossible to give a complete picture of all objections relating to human trafficking before all five ap-
peal courts because in Leeuwarden, at the time of the study, it was not possible to filter out only objection 
proceedings relating to human trafficking.

19 The documents in these files could include: the written notice of objection, an official report from the public 
prosecutor stating the reasons for the decision not to prosecute, the written report of the Advocate General 
and the official reports of the police.

20 Because the objection procedure can take more than a year, this means that the objections reported as being 
handled in a particular year could include objections that were already submitted the year before.

9. Continued residence

Objective
The most important objective of this study was to examine, from a comparative perspective, 
how the new rules on continued residence after B9 work in practice and to what the objec-
tives of the changes in the rules have been achieved.
Having observed that few applications were made for continued residence, with an earlier 
policy change the Minister for Immigration Affairs and Integration had intended to make a 
number of improvements: to make it easier to decide on an application for continued resi-
dence, to accelerate decisions and to clarify and improve the position of the victim. The ex-
pectation was that these changes would lead to more applications. It was also the intention 
to bring the policy more into line with the policy on continued residence in general (Article 
3.51 of the Aliens Decree).

Research questions
 – By whom is continued residence after the B9 procedure requested?
 – The following characteristics of the applicants were investigated as far as possible: the 

country of origin, the type of exploitation (including sector), gender, age, length of stay in 
the Netherlands, duration of the exploitation, length of stay with B9 status, status in the 
criminal investigation (complainant /witness), any special circumstances (psychological 
problems, for example).

 – How often is the permit granted and on what grounds, and how often is an application 
rejected and why?

 – What circumstances and factors are put forward by the applicant and which are taken into 
account by the IND (a possible conviction for an offence other than human trafficking in 
the trial, for example)?

 – Was reference made to an official report on the subject, a so-called safety file and/or a let-
ter from the public prosecutor in the file, and if so, what value was attached in practice to 
this documentation in estimating the risk of repatriation?

 – Are considerations concerning the burden of proof included in the procedure and are gen-
eral grounds for refusal applied?

Research method
This study consisted largely of a study of the files. BNRM asked the IND – the agency to 
which requests for residence permits under the B9 regulation and B16/7 regulation are sub-
mitted – to supply the files relating to applications for continued residence on expiry of the 
B9 regulation in 2006. There were 34 files. Lawyers and IND officials were also asked for 
additional information (in writing or in an interview).

Reservation to the study
The study concerned applications for continued residence in 2006.
The policy on continued residence after B9 was revised again during BNRM study.

Annex 3
Notes to tables and statistics

1 Notes to tables

This report contains many tables. These notes contain some remarks that are important for 
the interpretation of the tables.
The tables do not always come to precisely 100% because figures are rounded off. To make 
the tables easier to read, however, the totals are always given as 100%.
If a column in a table contains numbers, the letter N is used at the top of the column to de-
note the word ‘number’.
In the tables a dash (–) is used to represent the number zero and to indicate that the associ-
ated percentage is 0%. If the number is higher than zero, but the percentage after rounding 
off is 0%, 0% is used instead of a dash.

2 Note to the statistics used

Standard deviation
Averages are sometimes given in this report, for example the average age of suspects in human 
trafficking investigations. In that case, the number (N, see above) and the standard deviation 
(SD) are also sometimes given. The standard deviation expresses the range of the numbers 
over which the average is calculated. The higher the standard deviation, the greater the range.

Index figure
Some tables include an index figure. The index figure shows by how many the number – of 
suspects, for example – in a particular year has changed in relation to a reference year. The 
reference year is mentioned at the top of the table. The figure for that year is 100. An index 
figure higher than 100 indicates an increase in relation to the reference year and an index 
figure lower than 100 indicates a decline.

Annex 5
Reaction of the NRM to the advisory report of the 

Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs

Ministry of Justice

16 March 2009

Dear Mrs Albayrak,
In February, the Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs (ACVZ) published a report en-
titled ‘Protect victims and tackle human trafficking’.
I have a few remarks I would like to make about that report. I will confine myself to the rec-
ommendations relating to proposed changes to chapters B9 and B16/7 of the Aliens Act Im-
plementation Guidelines, since these recommendations go to the heart of efforts to tackle 
human trafficking.
In the first place, I am pleased that the ACVZ is also considering the fate of victims of human 
trafficking and their protection, and in doing so stressing the human rights approach.
In an earlier report, my predecessor also recommended that reception and help, which was at 
that time only provided for under the B9 regulation, should not be available only to victims 
who are cooperating with investigation and prosecution or are considering doing so (Rec-
ommendation 12 NRM3, 2004).

Recommendation 12: ‘[…] We recommend making shelter and assistance available not merely to 
victims who cooperate with investigation and prosecution or are considering doing so. Although a 
more or less formal assessment of victim status remains desirable in order to prevent the misuse of the 
regulation, there are victims about whom there is little or no doubt regarding their victim status, even 
though they do not have the courage to report it or consider doing so. This applies, for example, to 
victims found by the police with a high score based on a list of signals of human trafficking designed 
by public prosecution service and used by the police. Even without a complaint, useful information 
for investigation and prosecution may emerge from these victims’ stories. Furthermore, there is the 
chance that they will, once they have come to themselves, have the courage to cooperate after all with 
an investigation and prosecution.’

In assessing an individual’s status as a victim as referred to above, the opinion of organisa-
tion that provide assistance to victims should also be significant factor.
However, unlike the ACVZ, I do not see the need to amend the B9 regulation in the proposed 
manner. The recommended changes would certainly not improve the position of all victims 
of human trafficking. For example, victims who decide to make a complaint or otherwise 
cooperate with the criminal process, either immediately or during the reflection period, will 
be in a worse position than they are now and will remain in uncertainty longer. In my view, 
the ACVZ report would not, in fact, lead to any fundamental change; it would only extend 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   625 09-06-10   00:14



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

626

the period of temporary residence status – and hence also the period of uncertainty. It is, 
furthermore, unclear what ‘cooperation’ as referred to in recommendation 4 of the ACVZ 
report should actually involve in order to qualify for continued residence.
In addition, investigation remains of fundamental importance and I feel – as does the pub-
lic prosecution service – that the proposed measures for investigation and prosecution will 
have negative consequences.
The ACVZ’s advisory report makes a distinction between three phases. As regards the first 
phase, it recommends that if individuals have not personally identified themselves as victims 
of human trafficking, but there are other indications, the police should establish as soon as 
possible whether those indications should be regarded as a ‘slightest indication’. The ACVZ 
assumes that the police should be able to make the assessment within a relatively short period 
of no more than five working days. It is questionable whether they can, and such an assess-
ment would represent a negative step; it would introduce an additional obstacle that does not 
exist at the moment and could therefore also erode the effect of the term ‘slightest indication’. 
This idea also raises the question of what benefit this proposal would have in practice: what is 
it the police should investigate, where will the victim remain during this time (in a shelter?), 
what is his or her residence status, and when will he or she be informed of his or her rights?
This first phase also commences if a complaint or statement is made, but it is not clear what 
is meant by ‘statement’: cooperation with a criminal investigation or also a first intake inter-
view with the police?
Under the current regulation, a complaint or cooperation by a victim constitutes an ex officio 
application for B9 status. The first recommendation in the ACVZ report (‘Grant a tempo-
rary residence permit for six months whenever there is the ‘slightest indication’ of human 
trafficking or where a victim has cooperated with an investigation and prosecution’) means 
that the person has to wait six months (or 12 months in the case of an extension) before the 
next temporary permit will be granted. It is unclear why. Furthermore, it is not clear whether 
provisions currently included in the B9 regulation will apply during these six months, such 
as the possibility of performing work. That seems unlikely, in fact, since in this period the 
individual’s status as a victim has not yet been established. The advice also fails to address 
facilities for victims who decide within this period to cooperate with the criminal investiga-
tion, for example by making a complaint. In this phase, and the second phase, no distinction 
seems to be made between victims who do cooperate with the criminal investigation and 
victims who do not.
The second phase starts after three months and consists of a period of three to nine months 
within which the IND makes a decision and a residence permit for one year on the grounds 
of victim status.
The ACVZ proposes allowing the IND to assess, after the reflection period, whether the 
individual is actually a victim of trafficking and then, on the basis of that assessment, grant-
ing a second temporary residence permit if it decides that the individual is a victim. I fear 
that this proposal could lead to far more proceedings under immigration law on individuals’ 
victim status than are necessary under the current system.

As described above, the first part of the second phase represents three to nine months of 
uncertainty for the victim regarding the IND’s decision. It is, in fact, unclear what the IND’s 
own role in that should be. Would a victim who has made a complaint on which an investiga-
tion has started face the risk that the IND will nevertheless conclude that he or she is not a 
victim? That seems so (p. 39 under recommendation 4), since the ACVZ excludes victims 
who have made a complaint or have cooperated, but who are not likely to be victims (to be 
decided by the IND?) are excluded from continued residence.
The willingness of victims to make a complaint of human trafficking is not great. Although 
human trafficking is an offence that can be prosecuted without a complaint, the cooperation 
of victims (in the form of a complaint or otherwise), remains important, especially in terms 
of being able to start an investigation. I am therefore seriously concerned about a deteriora-
tion in the position of those victims who are willing to cooperate with the criminal investiga-
tion in the ACVZ’s proposal.
Like the ACVZ, I also observe a problem with complaints that provide few leads for an inves-
tigation. In response to reports that reached me, from both the police and organisations that 
help victims, I decided to conduct further research into this problem and to organise an ex-
pert meeting on the subject (which took place on 10 February 2009). The results will appear 
in the 7th report. I can at this point say that the police and the public prosecution service are 
frequently confronted with this problem, that it takes up a lot of their time and often leads 
to nothing, but that they do not rule out the possibility that in such cases the individuals are 
genuine victims. Victims can sometimes not provide more information (due to factors such 
as their cultural background, a loss of memory as a result of a trauma, because they do not 
trust government agencies or because they do not dare to and consequently say just enough, 
but still as little as possible, to secure a B9 residence permit). It is also known that the police 
find it very difficult in such cases to decide whether a person is genuinely a victim.
In the third phase, the continued residence, in the ACVZ proposal only recognised victims 
who cooperate will ultimately qualify for continued, permanent, residence. In this phase, 
the victim’s cooperation with the police and the public prosecution service will therefore 
quickly play a decisive role, although there is no definition of what that cooperation precisely 
involves. This cooperation must have taken place at some point in the second phase, a phase 
that lasts 18 to 24 months. This lengthy time span means, in my view, that leads for an inves-
tigation will be lost, which will frustrate efforts to tackle human trafficking even more.
I find this regrettable.
Victims of human trafficking must be protected. It is also important to provide victims with 
certainty as quickly as possible.
In one of the most recent amendments to the regulation on continued residence in the Aliens 
Act Implementation Guidelines (Government Gazette 2008, 37), you adopted my recommen-
dation (8) in the fifth report on human trafficking to the effect that the ground for continued 
residence under (a) in B16/7 of the Implementation Guidelines (the victim has made a com-
plaint for a criminal case that has led to a conviction) should not be confined to criminal cases 
that have led to a conviction for human trafficking but should also extend to a conviction for 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   627 09-06-10   00:14



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

628

an offence related to human trafficking. Even if human trafficking is included in the indictment 
and the defendant is not convicted of human trafficking but is convicted of another offence 
related to the human trafficking, there is currently a legal presumption that the repatriation of 
the victim involves risks. With this amendment, the assessment of whether a person is in fact a 
victim is to a large extent transferred from the judge to the public prosecution service.
This assessment could therefore be left entirely to the public prosecution service without 
any actual change in the policy.
In my view, the IND should already grant a victim continued residence when the public 
prosecution service decides to prosecute, although measures must be taken to ensure that 
it is possible for the victims to remain available to the police and public prosecution serv-
ice. However, whenever the public prosecution service decides not to prosecute for technical 
reasons (for example, because the offender cannot be found), the public prosecution service 
should always issue a statement concerning the victim’s status to the IND.
This naturally is without prejudice to the possibility, set out in B16/7 of the Aliens Act Imple-
mentation Guidelines, of granting continued residence if the State Secretary considers that 
there are special individual circumstances demanding that the victim should not required to 
leave the Netherlands. Following recommendation 12 in NRM3, this possibility should also 
be open to this latter category of victims. I agree with the ACVZ that organisations that pro-
vide assistance should play an important role in the assessment of those applications.
Without having addressed all of the ACVZ’s recommendations, therefore, I concur with the 
ACVZ’s conclusion that shelter and help should be available for identified victims who can-
not or dare not make a complaint or otherwise cooperate with the police and public prosecu-
tion service and I repeat recommendation 12 in NRM3.
But unlike the ACVZ, in my opinion this should be arranged in addition to the current B9/
B16 regulation. Amendment of the B9 regulation as proposed by the ACVZ would constitute 
an unacceptable deterioration in the position of victims who do cooperate with the criminal 
investigation.
Furthermore, amendment and refinement of a regulation that has greatly improved in recent 
years is greatly preferable to an entirely new regulation in which the pitfalls have still to be 
discovered, with the associated uncertainty for the victim.
Finally, I recommend that you transfer the assessment for continued residence under (a) in 
B16/7 from the judgment of the court to the decision to prosecute by the public prosecution 
service. Given the wording of the current regulation, this will require little if any change in 
the policy and would significantly shorten the period of uncertainty for victims regarding 
their residence status. After all, the public prosecution service’s decision to prosecute pro-
vides an objective criterion on a person’s status as victim.

Annex 6
Reaction of the NRM to the advisory report of the 

Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs

Ministry of Justice

16 March 2009

Dear Mrs Albayrak,
In February, the Advisory Committee on Migration Affairs (ACVZ) published a report en-
titled ‘Protect victims and tackle human trafficking’.
I have a few remarks I would like to make about that report. I will confine myself to the rec-
ommendations relating to proposed changes to chapters B9 and B16/7 of the Aliens Act Im-
plementation Guidelines, since these recommendations go to the heart of efforts to tackle 
human trafficking.
In the first place, I am pleased that the ACVZ is also considering the fate of victims of human 
trafficking and their protection, and in doing so stressing the human rights approach.
In an earlier report, my predecessor also recommended that reception and help, which was at 
that time only provided for under the B9 regulation, should not be available only to victims 
who are cooperating with investigation and prosecution or are considering doing so (Rec-
ommendation 12 NRM3, 2004).

Recommendation 12: ‘[…] We recommend making shelter and assistance available not merely to 
victims who cooperate with investigation and prosecution or are considering doing so. Although a 
more or less formal assessment of victim status remains desirable in order to prevent the misuse of the 
regulation, there are victims about whom there is little or no doubt regarding their victim status, even 
though they do not have the courage to report it or consider doing so. This applies, for example, to 
victims found by the police with a high score based on a list of signals of human trafficking designed 
by public prosecution service and used by the police. Even without a complaint, useful information 
for investigation and prosecution may emerge from these victims’ stories. Furthermore, there is the 
chance that they will, once they have come to themselves, have the courage to cooperate after all with 
an investigation and prosecution.’

In assessing an individual’s status as a victim as referred to above, the opinion of organisa-
tion that provide assistance to victims should also be significant factor.
However, unlike the ACVZ, I do not see the need to amend the B9 regulation in the proposed 
manner. The recommended changes would certainly not improve the position of all victims 
of human trafficking. For example, victims who decide to make a complaint or otherwise 
cooperate with the criminal process, either immediately or during the reflection period, will 
be in a worse position than they are now and will remain in uncertainty longer. In my view, 
the ACVZ report would not, in fact, lead to any fundamental change; it would only extend 

NMR Ch14-15_app.indd   629 09-06-10   00:14



Trafficking in Human Beings – seventh report of the national rapporteur

630

the period of temporary residence status – and hence also the period of uncertainty. It is, 
furthermore, unclear what ‘cooperation’ as referred to in recommendation 4 of the ACVZ 
report should actually involve in order to qualify for continued residence.
In addition, investigation remains of fundamental importance and I feel – as does the pub-
lic prosecution service – that the proposed measures for investigation and prosecution will 
have negative consequences.

The ACVZ’s advisory report makes a distinction between three phases. As regards the first 
phase, it recommends that if individuals have not personally identified themselves as victims 
of human trafficking, but there are other indications, the police should establish as soon as 
possible whether those indications should be regarded as a ‘slightest indication’. The ACVZ 
assumes that the police should be able to make the assessment within a relatively short pe-
riod of no more than five working days. It is questionable whether they can, and such an 
assessment would represent a negative step; it would introduce an additional obstacle that 
does not exist at the moment and could therefore also erode the effect of the term ‘slightest 
indication’. This idea also raises the question of what benefit this proposal would have in 
practice: what is it the police should investigate, where will the victim remain during this 
time (in a shelter?), what is his or her residence status, and when will he or she be informed 
of his or her rights?
This first phase also commences if a complaint or statement is made, but it is not clear what 
is meant by ‘statement’: cooperation with a criminal investigation or also a first intake inter-
view with the police?
Under the current regulation, a complaint or cooperation by a victim constitutes an ex officio 
application for B9 status. The first recommendation in the ACVZ report (‘Grant a tempo-
rary residence permit for six months whenever there is the ‘slightest indication’ of human 
trafficking or where a victim has cooperated with an investigation and prosecution’) means 
that the person has to wait six months (or 12 months in the case of an extension) before the 
next temporary permit will be granted. It is unclear why. Furthermore, it is not clear whether 
provisions currently included in the B9 regulation will apply during these six months, such 
as the possibility of performing work. That seems unlikely, in fact, since in this period the 
individual’s status as a victim has not yet been established. The advice also fails to address 
facilities for victims who decide within this period to cooperate with the criminal investiga-
tion, for example by making a complaint. In this phase, and the second phase, no distinction 
seems to be made between victims who do cooperate with the criminal investigation and 
victims who do not.

The second phase starts after three months and consists of a period of three to nine months 
within which the IND makes a decision and a residence permit for one year on the grounds 
of victim status.
The ACVZ proposes allowing the IND to assess, after the reflection period, whether the 
individual is actually a victim of trafficking and then, on the basis of that assessment, grant-
ing a second temporary residence permit if it decides that the individual is a victim. I fear

that this proposal could lead to far more proceedings under immigration law on individuals’ 
victim status than are necessary under the current system.
As described above, the first part of the second phase represents three to nine months of 
uncertainty for the victim regarding the IND’s decision. It is, in fact, unclear what the IND’s 
own role in that should be. Would a victim who has made a complaint on which an investiga-
tion has started face the risk that the IND will nevertheless conclude that he or she is not a 
victim? That seems so (p. 39 under recommendation 4), since the ACVZ excludes victims 
who have made a complaint or have cooperated, but who are not likely to be victims (to be 
decided by the IND?) are excluded from continued residence.

The willingness of victims to make a complaint of human trafficking is not great. Although 
human trafficking is an offence that can be prosecuted without a complaint, the cooperation 
of victims (in the form of a complaint or otherwise), remains important, especially in terms 
of being able to start an investigation. I am therefore seriously concerned about a deteriora-

a phase that lasts 18 to 24 months. This lengthy time span means, in my view, that leads for 
an investigation will be lost, which will frustrate efforts to tackle human trafficking even 
more.
I find this regrettable.

Victims of human trafficking must be protected. It is also important to provide victims with 
certainty as quickly as possible.
