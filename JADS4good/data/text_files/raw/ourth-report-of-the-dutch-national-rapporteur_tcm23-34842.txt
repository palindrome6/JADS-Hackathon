The universal notion of protecting human dignity, which is at stake in case of THB, is underlined by the 
words ‘Mensenhandel is verboden’ (trafficking in human beings is prohibited) on the front cover of this 
report. These words are taken from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which is 
part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Following the example of the Dutch artist Henk 
Visch, who organised in 2003 an exposition under the title ‘Mensenhandel is verboden’, the words are put 
in handwriting to stress the importance of their notion in daily practice.

1 Introduction 
 
 
In mid-2004 the third report of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings (Na-
tionaal Rapporteur Mensenhandel - NRM) was published. Besides quantitative data up to and 
including the year 2002, this report contained background information and more than 60 rec-
ommendations for improving the way trafficking in human beings (hereinafter abbreviated to 
THB) should be tackled. One of the recommendations was to draw up a National Action Plan 
for Trafficking in Human Beings (Nationaal Actieplan Mensenhandel - NAM). Such a plan has 
indeed been produced. In December 2004 the NAM was presented to the Lower House.1 The 
NAM is also the government’s response to recommendations in the third report. At the time of 
completing this fourth report (May 2005), the parliamentary debate on the third report and the 
NAM has yet to be held.  
 
Apart from the realisation of the NAM, a number of other developments in the area of (combat-
ing) THB are worth mentioning. For example, the old article on THB in the Criminal Code (Ar-
ticle 250a), which only covers exploitation in the sex industry, was replaced on 1 January 2005 
by an article that covers all forms of THB (Article 273a; Appendix 1). This includes exploita-
tion in the sex industry, exploitation in other sectors of work and services, as well as certain ac-
tivities aimed at the removal of human organs. The B9 regulation has been modified in line with 
this and the field of work of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human 
Beings (BNRM) is expected to be broadened accordingly. One point of attention for BNRM is 
therefore to find out if, and if so, in which sectors and on what scale, such modern forms of 
slavery occur. For this purpose, BNRM has started up a study into ‘other exploitation’. 
UNICEF and ECPAT are also conducting studies in this area, specifically focusing on underage 
victims. Chain partners in tackling THB face the task of remaining in a state of readiness and 
preparing themselves to assist the victims of other forms of exploitation as the need arises and 
to track down and prosecute the perpetrators. In order to inform and activate the chain partners, 
BNRM together with the Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Justice organised a meet-
ing on this subject. In addition, in the first half of 2005 the Information Point for Youth Prosti-
tution (Informatiepunt Jeugdprostitutie) was started up with Transact and the Expertise Centre 
for Trafficking in Human Beings/Human Smuggling (Expertisecentrum Mensenhandel/Mensen-
smokkel) with the National Crime Squad. The efforts to improve the implementation of the B9 
regulation in practice as well as the efforts of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in view of 
the recent broadening of legislation on THB also belong to this list of developments, which is 
by no means exhaustive. 
 
But there are areas of concern too. For example, in 2004 a number of subsidies to various public 
organisations that were active in the policy areas of prostitution and (combating) THB were 
withdrawn or reduced, as a result of which important expertise has been lost, or is in danger of 
being lost. Another matter of concern is the fewer number of investigations into THB in 2003 
that were successfully completed, and also the fewer number of suspects arrested and ‘referred’ 
for each investigation (See Chapter 3). In addition, the National Police Project on Prostitution 
and Trafficking in Human Beings (Projectgroep Prostitutie Mensenhandel/de Nederlandse 
Politie - PPM/dNP) did not meet for a number of months, and there are regular signs that in cer-
tain regions, partly because of capacity problems, there are no inspections, or only sporadic 
ones, taking place in sex establishments. It is therefore doubtful whether the fight against ex-

2 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

ploitation in the sex industry is indeed being given sufficient priority and capacity on a continu-
ous basis, both in terms of administrative inspections by municipalities (in the role of decentral-
ised government) in the licensed sector as well as the investigative and prosecution efforts - 
within and outside this sector - for which also the central government bears responsibility.  
 
As has already been emphasised repeatedly in earlier reports, administrative control is a crucial 
enforcement tool. Crucial because the government’s rationale behind distinguishing between 
the legalised sector without THB on the one hand and a thus increasingly more defined forbid-
den sector with an increased risk of THB on the other hand is otherwise undermined. Provi-
sional figures show, incidentally, that the number of successfully completed investigations into 
THB in 2004 again increased significantly (see Appendix 5). 
Enforcement - both administrative and in criminal justice - remains an important point, also in 
the light of the above-mentioned broadening of the definition of THB, which in fact demands 
alertness to potential exploitation within a much broader range of work situations. 
 
This fourth report does not go into further detail regarding the abovementioned issues; it fo-
cuses on additional quantitative information for the year 20032, concentrating on three areas, 
namely the victims of THB that have reported to the Foundation against Trafficking in Women 
(Stichting Tegen Vrouwenhandel - STV), investigations into THB and prosecutions brought by 
the police (dealt with by the PPS and settled in court). The figures are presented together with 
figures (already published in previous reports) for the years 2000 to 2002 inclusive, in order to 
show any trends. 
 
Chapter 2 contains information on the victims of THB that have been reported to the STV.  
Chapter 3 concerns investigations carried out by the Dutch police into cases of THB.  
Chapter 4 contains information on cases of THB registered with and handled by the PPS, and 
their settlement by the courts. 
Chapter 5 contains the summary. 
 
For this report, information was made available by the STV and the police, for which BNRM is 
most grateful. A separate word of thanks goes to Peter Paul Groen of the Statistical Data Supply 
and Policy Analysis Unit (Statistische informatievoorziening en Beleidsanalyse - SiBa) of the 
Scientific Research and Documentation Centre (Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documenta-
tiecentrum - WODC), for the analyses of the PPS’s data, and to Onno Stijger and Suzanne Bei-
jer for the contribution they made as apprentices in the police study. Thanks are also due to 
Alinde Verhaag for her contribution as guest worker at BNRM.

2 Victims 
 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
This chapter contains statistical data on (possible) victims of THB. It is information from the 
registration of the Foundation against Trafficking in Women (Stichting Tegen Vrouwenhandel - 
STV) and information from the police’s victim registration system. 
 
 
2.2 Victim registrations kept by the Foundation against Trafficking in Women 
 
One of the STV’s tasks is to register the victims of THB. This paragraph contains information 
on the victims registered by the STV in 2003. Only basic background details, such as region and 
country of origin, age, sex and reporter are given. 
 
2.2.1 Regions and countries of origin 
 
Table 2.1 gives an overview of the regions of origin of the (possible) victims of THB that have 
been registered by the STV.

257 victims were reported in 2003, significantly fewer than in 2002 and even 2001, the year that 
the STV was less readily accessible. Incidentally, this does not indicate the start of a new trend: 
the number of reports increased substantially again in 2004, as shown in the appendix with the 
provisional figures for 2004 (see Appendix 5). In 2003 too, most victims by far were from 
Central and Eastern Europe. The number of reports from this region has remained virtually the 
same since 2001 from a relative point of view. The number of reports concerning victims 
originating from Africa fluctuates somewhat, but was again considerable in 2003 (25%).  
 
Table 2.2 contains the most common countries of origin of the victims reported.2 Appendix 2 
(Table B2.2) gives a complete overview of all countries of origin. 
                                                           
1  The STV registration for 2001 deviates sharply from earlier years, probably due to the poor accessibility of the 

STV at that time. 
2  Countries are included that were the origin of at least 15 victims in the period from 2000 to 2003, or at least five in 

2003.

Just as in 2002, Bulgaria was the most frequently occurring country of origin in 2003. Romania 
occupies the second place in that year as the origin of an increasing number of victims. The 
number of victims from Nigeria fluctuates, but was slightly lower in 2003 than in 2002. A 
sudden and strikingly large number of victims from Brazil were registered in 2003. 
 
2.2.2 Age and gender

A total of 20 underage victims were reported to the STV in 2003, which is less than in previous 
years. If we do not include victims whose age is unknown, the percentage of underage victims 
declined from 16% in 2001 and 2002 to 9% in 2003. Most victims come in the age category of 
18 to 23 years old, and this applies to all the years studied.

Most victims registered by the STV are reported by the police. In 2003 this was almost two-
thirds of all reports. Other reports were received from private individuals, reception facilities, 
refugee/asylum organisations, assistance organisations and - more occasionally - other organi-
sations or persons.  
 
 
2.3 (Possible) victims in the Police Information Node System  
 
In principle, all regional polices forces register all victims or possible victims of THB in the 
victim registration system known as the Police Information Node System (Informatie Knoop-
punt Politie Systeem - IKP-S). Some of these victims come to light when carrying out adminis-
trative inspections in the prostitution sector, while others come in contact with the police in 
other ways, such as by approaching the police themselves.  
In order to establish whether someone is (possibly) a victim of THB, a list of signals is used, 
with each signal being assigned a number of points. At a score of 10 points or more, the possi-
ble victim is registered in IKP-S.NRM3 
 
The Police Monitor for Prostitution and Trafficking in Human Beings 2002 (PPM/dNP, 2003) 
showed that five of the twenty-five regional police forces did not register any (possible) victims 
in IKP-S. 
 

                                                           
3  E.g. prostitutes, brothel owners, clients, friends and partners. 
4  From 2001 onwards, no reports are registered as ‘anonymous’. In 2002 and 2003, the STV Helpdesk always asked 

which category the reporter belonged to.  
5  E.g. public organisations, migrant organisations, associations, foundations and local initiatives. 



6 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

Concerning IKP-S, the following remarks are relevant: 
- It is not always clear whether police forces that do register (possible) victims in IKP-S 

are consistent in this. Some forces, for example, register few victims when one would 
actually expect more, based on the size of the force and the prostitution sector within 
the region concerned.6 

- Not only (possible) victims are registered in the victim registration system, but some-
times - suspected and unsuspected - relations of the victims as well. 

- Registration in the system is not easy, nor is the prevention of double entries and trac-
ing of victims. Victims often work under different names and the names of foreign vic-
tims are not always spelt in a consistent manner. 

 
2.3.1 Country of birth 
 
Table 2.5 gives an overview of the most common countries of birth of (possible) victims regis-
tered in IKP-S.7 An overview of all countries of birth can be found in Appendix 2 (Table B2.5).

In the year 2003, the police registered 153 (possible) victims in IKP-S, significantly fewer than 
in 2002 when 371 (possible) victims were entered in the system. Potential explanations for this 
relate to technical problems when entering information in IKP-S, a reduced motivation to regis-
ter the victim, a decline in the number of victims in the licensed segment of the sex industry, 
and possibly also less police effort given to prostitution inspections and investigations into 
THB. 
Relatively speaking, most victims in both 2002 and 2003 originate from Bulgaria and - to a 
lesser extent - Romania. In addition, the Netherlands and Nigeria scored relatively highly in 
2003 as countries of origin. The percentage of victims born in the Netherlands compared to 
2002 increased sharply. 
 

                                                           
6  Lower numbers may however also be a reflection of a ‘cleaner’ licensed sector, where inspections are indeed made 

but few victims are found, or to the decline in the number of inspections or other police activity in tackling THB. 
7  Those countries are included from which at least 10 victims came in the years 2002 and 2003 together, or at least 4 

in the year 2003.

In 2002, 51 underage persons were registered as possible victims, whereas in 2003 there were 
21. In both years they accounted for 14% of (possible) victims. With regard to the other age 
categories too, the percentages in both years are virtually the same. Most victims come in the 
category of 18 to 23 years.  
 
In 2003, two men were registered in IKP-S. Both were born in Ecuador and are 35 and 36 years 
old respectively. Further analysis by the Trafficking in Human Beings Information Unit 
(Informatie Eenheid Mensenhandel - IEM) showed that these are both transsexuals who were 
found in a streetwalker’s zone. Both were residing illegally in the Netherlands. 
In 2002, 13 men were registered in IKP-S. Twelve of them were underage, and all came from 
various countries outside the European Union. 
 





 

3 Investigation 
 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
Each year BNRM analyses all successfully completed investigations into THB. An explanation 
of the study method can be found in Appendix 3. This chapter contains the results for the year 
2003. 
 
 
3.2 Investigations into trafficking in human beings 
 
Table 3.1 contains an overview of all investigations into THB completed and ‘referred’ to the 
Public Prosecution Service (PPS) each year,1 also showing the extent of the rise or fall in the 
number of investigations compared to the base year 2000 (with indices)2. The results in Table 
3.1 have also been subdivided according to the type of THB: cross-border or domestic. In the 
case of cross-border THB, victims are recruited abroad, whereas with domestic THB they are 
recruited in the Netherlands. In both cases they are exploited in the Netherlands (among other 
countries) in prostitution.3

The number of completed investigations into THB rose sharply from 2000 onwards,4 but was 
lower in the year 2003 than in the two preceding years.  
Of all the investigations completed in 2003, 24% concerned domestic and 76% cross-border 
THB. These percentages have remained virtually the same for the last three years studied.5 
 
Reason for the investigation 
For the period from 2001 to 20036 was examined what the direct reason was for the investiga-
tion into THB. Table 3.2 contains the result. 

                                                           
1  The investigations were carried out by the police and the Royal Military Constabulary. 
2  For an explanation of the indices, see Appendix 4. 
3  If victims are originally recruited abroad, but sold (on) in the Netherlands or recruited once again (e.g. after having 

worked independently for a time in prostitution), their case is categorised as cross-border THB. A combination of 
cross-border and domestic THB occurred twice in the cases investigated (in 2001 and in 2003). In the first case, the 
victims were predominantly recruited in the Netherlands, but occasionally in Belgium as well. This investigation 
was categorised as domestic THB. In the second case, the victims were recruited largely in Hungary, but also in the 
Netherlands. This investigation was categorised as cross-border THB. 

4  Incidentally, in the year 2000 the number of completed investigations into THB was already higher than in previous 
years (see earlier reports of the NRM presenting figures from 1997 onwards). 

5  The percentages of investigations into domestic THB per annum (as a percentage of the number of investigations in 
that year): 32% (2000), 25% (2001), 24% (2002) and 24% (2003). 

6  This data was not collected for the year 2000 and part of 2001. In view of its renewed relevance, the question has 
been included again.

In 2003 ‘spontaneous’ reports were relatively often the basis of investigations into THB. The 
number of investigations following reasons other than those mentioned (category ‘other’) rose 
in the years studied. In 2003 these were often reports by witnesses. For example, they reported 
the fact that women were locked up or forced to prostitute themselves, or incidents of violence. 
One report of THB came from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Immigratie- en 
Naturalisatiedienst - IND) and one from the Royal Military Constabulary. One investigation 
was also started up following a report by acquaintances of a suspect who reported that he was 
acting as a ‘loverboy’. 
 
The reason for investigations into domestic THB differs significantly from those for investiga-
tions into cross-border THB.7 With domestic THB, a report is more often the direct reason than 
with cross-border THB (55% compared to 26%). With cross-border THB, checks are more of-
ten the reason (23% compared to 10%). 
 
 
3.3 Suspects  
 
Table 3.3 contains information (per annum) on the number of suspects of THB that were identi-
fied, arrested and ‘referred’ to the PPS in successful investigations. The indices show the devel-
opment in the number of identified suspects. In addition, the proportion of the identified sus-
pects that were arrested and ‘referred’ are also given (in percentages).

*Percentage of the number of suspects identified in the year concerned. 
 
In the successful investigations completed in 2003, the police identified 148 suspects of THB, 
arrested 135 suspects and ‘referred’ 127 suspects to the PPS.8 The number of suspects arrested 
and ‘referred’ in 2003 was lower than in the two preceding years and comparable with the level 
in 2000.9 
                                                           
7  Chi2=10.41, df=4; p<.05. 
8  The actual number of identified and arrested suspects is probably higher, because there may have been suspects 

identified as such and arrested in investigations that are in progress or have been halted. 
9  Incidentally, in 2000 the number of suspects in all categories was higher than in previous years (see second report 

which presents the figures from 1997 onwards). 



INVESTIGATION  11 

 

In the rest of this paragraph, arrested suspects will be referred to. 
 
Table 3.4 contains an overview of the average number of arrested suspects in each investiga-
tion, divided into the type of THB (cross-border or domestic).10

The average number of suspects arrested in each investigation fell (further) in 2003. This fall 
applies more to investigations into cross-border THB than to investigations into domestic THB. 
The average number of suspects arrested in investigations into domestic THB, however, is 
lower (in all years) than in investigations into cross-border THB. 
 
Gender 
The majority of the arrested suspects are male. However, almost a quarter of the suspects ar-
rested from 2000 to 2003 are women. The percentage of women among the suspects fell in the 
year 2002, but rose again in 2003.11 The female suspects arrested are mostly engaged in cross-
border THB (96% of the women arrested from 2000 to 2003). 
 
Nationality 
Table 3.5 shows the nationality of the suspects, divided according to the year in which the in-
vestigation was completed. Only the most common nationalities are contained in the table, in 
order of declining frequency.12 A table with the nationality of all suspects is to be found in Ap-
pendix 2 (Table B3.5).

12  Only countries of which a total of six or more suspects were nationals in the period from 2000 to 2003 are included 

in the table.

The Dutch, Romanian and Bulgarian nationalities formed the ‘top three’ in 2003. In that year 
the number of suspects of Romanian nationality rose markedly. On the other hand, after a peak 
in 2002 the number of arrested suspects of Albanian nationality fell (sharply). The number of 
Nigerian suspects was also low in 2003 (as it was in 2002 too) compared to previous years. 
 
Country of birth 
Table 3.6 contains an overview (in order of declining frequency) of the most common countries

Also when one examines the countries of birth of the suspects, the Netherlands, Romania and 
Bulgaria were the top three in 2003, and the rise in the number of suspects from Romania and 
the fall in the number of suspects from Albania is particularly striking. Compared to the over-
view of nationalities, the number of suspects from a Turkish or Surinamese background is 
greater. Their share grew compared to previous years.

Almost all of the suspects born in Morocco and the Dutch Antilles (94% and 92% respectively) 
were suspected of domestic THB. This applies to 64% of the suspects born in Surinam. One can 
clearly see that in the period 2000 to 2003 a relatively large number of suspects born in (former) 
Yugoslavia, Ukraine and (to a lesser extent) Albania were suspected of domestic THB. Suspects 
originating from other foreign countries are mostly or exclusively suspected of cross-border 
THB.  
 
Residence status 
The residence status of suspects of non-Dutch nationality was examined for the years 2000 to 
2003. This shows that 38% of the suspects in 2003 were residing legally in the Netherlands at 
the time of their arrest (usually by virtue of a residence permit, visa or a ‘visa-free period’15).16 
Almost two-thirds (62%) of suspects of non-Dutch nationality in that year were therefore in the 
Netherlands illegally at that time.  
The number of foreign suspects that were residing illegally in the Netherlands rose strongly in 
the period 2000 to 2003, from 10% in 2000 to 42% in 2001, 48% in 2002 and 62% in 2003.  

                                                           
14  Only countries in which a total of six or more suspects were born in the period 2000 to 2003 are included in the ta-

ble. 
15  Those who remain in the Netherlands during the ‘visa-free period’ come from countries without a visa obligation 

(e.g. (former) candidate member states of the EU). They may remain in the Netherlands without a visa for between 
3 and 6 months, depending on the country of origin. The visa-free period is cancelled, incidentally, as soon as a 
criminal offence is committed. 

16  N=285 (not possible to find out for all suspects of non-Dutch nationality). 



14 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 

Proprietors 
Among the suspects arrested in 2003, 22 were proprietors of sex establishments: of these, 6 ran 
licensed sex establishments, 11 unlicensed sex establishments and 5 establishments which, in 
the guise of a different business activity, were (also) engaged in running sexual services (two 
Turkish cafes and one beauty salon).17 Twenty-one of them (95%) were ‘referred’ to the PPS. 
These percentages remained virtually unchanged from 2001 onwards.18 
As well as prosecuting proprietors in criminal proceedings, it is also possible to impose admin-
istrative measures (sanctions). For this purpose, a report must be made to the municipality that a 
(licensed) proprietor is a suspect in a criminal investigation. In 2003, 5 of the 6 suspected pro-
prietors (of licensed establishments) were reported to the municipality, in one case this still had 
to be done. In so far as known to the police, (also) administrative proceedings have been initi-
ated against 4 of these proprietors. Against 3 proprietors this has led - also in so far as known to 
the police - to administrative sanctions. These numbers may yet rise, because the team leaders 
of investigations completed do not always know whether an administrative process has (al-
ready) been initiated.  
 
Table 3.8 shows the extent to which assumptions of involvement in THB have (nevertheless) 
arisen concerning proprietors who ‘emerged’ in the investigations completed in 2002 and 2003 
(also including the proprietors who were not officially regarded as suspects). For this purpose - 
just as in the third report of the NRM - three categories of possible involvement have been 
used.19 
 
Table 3.8 Level of awareness of proprietors, according to the police (2002 and 2003)20  
Possible involvement         2002         2003         Total 
 N % N % N % 
Proprietor ignorant 49 39% 18 44% 67 40% 
Proprietor is aware 75 59% 9 22% 84 50% 
Proprietor is active as trafficker 3 2% 14 34% 17 10% 
Total 127 100% 41 100% 168 100% 
 
The results for 2003 show a completely different picture to that for 2002. For example, a rela-
tively higher number of proprietors in 2003 were categorised as traffickers in human beings, 
and significantly fewer proprietors as ‘aware, but not actively cooperating’. The percentage of 
proprietors that, in the opinion of those persons interviewed, were unaware of THB, remained 
more or less the same.  
 
 
 
 

                                                           
17  A total of 54 sex establishments were involved in the successfully completed investigations into THB, of which 19 

were unlicensed. In 2002 this figure was 140, 38 of which were unlicensed. 
18  In 2000, 10 proprietors were arrested and 9 ‘referred’, in 2001 22 were arrested and 18 ‘referred’, whereas 19 were 

arrested and 18 ‘referred’ in 2002. Over the entire period from 2000 to 2003, 68 proprietors were arrested and 61 
were ‘referred’. 

19  1) The proprietor is not aware of the fact that victims are being exploited. 2) The proprietor is indeed aware of this, 
but does not actively cooperate. These are usually proprietors who act as if it was none of their concern: they profit 
from the supply of (new) ‘girls’, but often do not earn more from them than from legal prostitutes. 3) The proprie-
tor plays an active role in (parts of) the THB process. The proceeds are higher than usual for these brothel owners, 
because they take more of the victims’ earnings than the customary 50%. 

20  In a few cases an establishment had more than one proprietor and/or owner. In these cases, for each establishment 
the proprietor who comes under the ‘most serious’ category of involvement is included in the table.

3.4 Methods adopted by traffickers in human beings 
 
3.4.1 Recruitment 
 
The THB process nearly always begins with recruiting, press-ganging or kidnapping victims, in 
the Netherlands or abroad (this paragraph goes on to refer to all these cases as ‘recruiting’). 
 
Cross-border THB: recruiters tracked down? 
With cross-border THB, not all those persons involved in THB are identified and/or tracked 
down or prosecuted. The recruiters in particular often remain out of reach.NRM3 Table 3.9 shows 
the extent to which recruiters are arrested in completed investigations into cross-border THB.21  
 
Table 3.9 Arrests of recruiters in cross-border THB, per annum  
Recruiters arrested     2000     2001     2002    2003  Total 
 N % N % N % N % N % 
All 5 29% 10 28% 24 57% 16 50% 55 43% 
Some  3 18% 6 17% 8 19% 7 22% 24 19% 
None  9 53% 20 56% 10 24% 9 28% 48 38% 
Total 17 100% 36 100% 42 100% 32 100% 127 100% 
 
In 2003, as in 2002, the percentage of investigations into cross-border THB whereby - as far as 
is known - all recruiters were arrested, was much higher than in previous years. In half of the 
investigations all the recruiters were arrested, and some of them in a further fifth of the investi-
gations. It would therefore appear that recruiters have managed to keep out of reach to a lesser 
extent in the past few years. Even so, in (more than) a quarter of the cases no recruiter at all was 
arrested.  
 
Buying and selling victims, and middlemen 
As far as is known, in 14% of all cases completed in 2003, victims were sold (on). This per-
centage fluctuated widely in the total period under study.22 
Another phenomenon relates to the ‘middlemen’: these persons buy and sell victims, without 
bringing them into the sex industry themselves. In 6 investigations in 2001, persons came to 
light that were working exclusively as middlemen, while in 2002 this number rose to 13 and in 
2003 it fell again to 7.23 
 
3.4.2 Travel and residence documents 
 
Table 3.10 shows for the investigations concerning cross-border THB the extent to which the 
victims were in possession of a valid or fake24 passport. Since a single investigation may in-
volve various victims bearing different identify documents, the table does not add up to 100%. 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
21  Investigations into domestic THB have not been included here, because the recruiters are virtually always arrested 

in such investigations. These are in fact the same persons as those who bring victims into prostitution and exploit 
them.NRM3 

22  8% (2000), 25% (2001), 22% (2002) and 14% (2003). 
23  Percentages were 13% (2001), 24% (2002) and 17% (2003). This was not studied in the year 2000 and earlier. 
24  A fake passport is understood to mean one that is fake (i.e. forged) as well as a passport in which information has 

been changed or which is used improperly.

In most of the cases of cross-border THB completed in 2003, one or more victims had a valid 
passport. The percentage of investigations whereby victims possessed a fake passport fell (fur-
ther) in 2003. However, in almost one-third of the cases in 2003, one or more victims had a fake 
passport. In both 2002 and 2003, roughly half of the fake passports showed the nationality of an 
EU member state.26  
Fake visas are used less frequently; they were not found in any of the investigations in 2003.  
 
3.4.3 Putting victims to work in the sex industry 
 
Type of sex work 
It was examined which type of sex work the victims in investigations completed in 2003 were 
expected to carry out. In all investigations, prostitution was involved. Two involved sex enter-
tainment,27 and one investigation concerned a case where victims were also ‘used’ for making 
pornography.  
 
Prostitution sectors 
Victims of THB may be put to work in various sectors of prostitution, such as window prostitu-
tion, clubs/brothels/private homes, the escort sector and street prostitution. Table 3.11 shows 
which prostitution sectors were involved in the cases of THB that were investigated. Since vic-
tims may be put to work in several sectors, the percentages do not add up to 100%. 
 
Table 3.11 Prostitution sectors involved, per annum

Other - - - - 2 4% 3 7% 5 3% 
 
In 2003 the number of investigations that concerned window and club prostitution declined. The 
number of investigations focusing on the escort sector remained relatively constant, whereas the 
number of investigations into street prostitution increased relatively slightly.  
Businesses that (also) engage in running sexual services in the guise of another type of business 
are included in Table 3.11 in the category ‘other’. In 2003, as in 2002, these involved prostitu-
tion in Turkish cafes.28 In addition, in 2003 victims were prostituted in a beauty salon. 
 
 
                                                           
25  This information could not be ascertained for all the years. The number of investigations for which this is known is 

16 (2000), 36 (2001), 42 (2002), 29 (2003) and 121 (total).

Means of coercion 
Traffickers in human beings use all kinds of means of coercion to bring women into prostitu-
tion, to keep them there and/or to take their earnings. Table 3.12 gives an overview. Since traf-
fickers may use several means of coercion, the table does not add up to 100%.

Voodoo 4 17% 4 8% 3 6% 2 5% 13 8% 
 
In all the years studied, (the threat of) violence plays an important role in bringing victims into 
prostitution and keeping them there, as well as keeping them under watch and/or locking them 
up and imposing debts on them. The first means of coercion is used in both cross-border and 
domestic THB, whereas the latter two methods are used above all with cross-border THB.  
The rise observed in 2002 in the number of investigations concerning the use (by ‘loverboys’), 
of ‘feigned love’ to get victims into prostitution, did not persist into 2003. However, this 
method is (once again) not used exclusively with domestic THB.29 
Both in 2002 and 2003, nine investigations involved drug use by victims.30 It was examined for 
2003 to what extent this drug use was voluntary. According to the police, in 7 of the 9 cases this 
was indeed so.  
In 2003, victims were raped by the traffickers in 13 cases (31%). 
 
Earnings for victims 
Not all victims are - physically - forced to do their work. Sometimes they are ‘only’ forced to 
hand over (part of) their money. In those cases completed in 2003, it was examined how often 
victims themselves keep any money from their work in prostitution. This is usually based on 
their own statements.31 Of the 37 cases in 2003 in which traffickers confiscated money, there 
were 13 (35%) in which the victims were allowed or able to keep some of the money.32 In two-
thirds of the cases, the victims had to hand over everything.  
 
Mobility 
Victims of THB are usually put to work in more than one place, often outside the Nether-
lands.NRM3 Table 3.13 shows in which countries, outside the Netherlands and the country of ori-

                                                           
29  Of the 11 cases in 2003 in which this method was used, 5 concerned cross-border and 6 concerned domestic THB. 
30  In 2003 this was in 6 of such cases of domestic THB and in 3 cases of cross-border THB. In 2002 the figures were 

1 and 8 respectively. 
31  Sometimes traffickers tell victims that the money is being saved for them or transferred to their families. Because 

traffickers act as if they are really doing so (Van Dijk et al, 2002) it is assumed, if no proof of this is found, that all 
the money is confiscated. 

32  In some cases it is unknown whether and how much of the earnings will be taken, for example because victims 
have not yet been working in prostitution.

gin, the victims have worked in prostitution according to the investigations.33 The numbers in

The percentage of investigations whereby victims were brought into prostitution outside the 
Netherlands as well fell further in 2003. Victims that were brought into prostitution elsewhere 
most often (also) ended up in Germany. Other countries that ‘scored’ relatively highly in 2003 
were Belgium and Italy.  
In the period from 2000 to 2003, victims of cross-border THB were brought into prostitution 
outside the Netherlands (and outside the country of origin) more often than victims of domestic 
THB.36 Victims of domestic THB are predominantly put to work in the neighbouring countries 
of Germany and Belgium, while victims of cross-border THB are also put to work in other 
countries. 
 
3.4.4 Criminal collaboration 
 
THB is sometimes carried out by persons working alone, but more often by groups. This sub-
paragraph deals with the criminal organisational forms that are found in THB. 
  
Types of collaboration  
As already mentioned in previous NRM reports, three forms of criminal organisation can be 
distinguished: the solo operator,37 the isolated criminal group38 and the criminal networks.39 

                                                           
33  The table includes only the countries that appear - in this context - in four or more investigations in the period from 

2000 to 2003. 
34  N=25 (2000); 47 (2001); 51 (2002); 41 (2003) and 164 (Total). 
35  The other countries are: Aruba, Turkey, United Kingdom, Surinam, Poland, Ghana, Albania, Austria en Bosnia-

Herzegovina. 
36  In 51% of the investigations into cross-border THB from 2000 to 2003, it emerges that the victims - as far as is 

known - were brought into prostitution elsewhere too, and in 23% of the investigations into domestic THB. This 
difference is significant: Chi2=10.09; df=1; p<.01. 

37  A single person exploits one or more girls. Although many ‘pimps’ know each other and also discuss things to-
gether, these are ‘one-man bands’. Sometimes the pimp is helped by an ‘accomplice’ who plays a very marginal 
role. For example, a pimp may ask someone to keep an eye on the victim while he goes out for a moment. 

38  A group with at least two ‘principal perpetrators’NRM3 and a maximum of five members, who are responsible for the 
entire THB process and which has no demonstrable contacts with other (groups of) persons involved in THB. With 
cross-border THB, the members of the group collect the victims from abroad themselves – such as through a mem-
ber of the family of the principal perpetrator or partner living abroad. 

39  The number of perpetrators involved is at least six, but often much higher. This typical group often meets the de-
scription of criminal macro-networks, as described in the study by Klerks (2000, p.75): “In this undifferentiated 
criminal infrastructure, in principal everyone is linked to everyone else through one or more intermediaries. There

Table 3.14 shows the organisational forms as they emerge from the investigations that have 
been completed and ‘referred’.40

There was a slight relative increase in the number of investigations focusing on (parts of) net-
works in 2003; however it did not reach the level of the years before 2002.NRM2 One-third of the 
investigations completed in 2003 focused on solo operators. 
Table 3.14 concerns an analysis of THB investigations. If one looks at the suspects in these in-
vestigations, it can be seen that over the entire study period 69% of the suspects arrested form 
part of a network, 19% of an isolated group and 12% are solo operators. This division can be 
found in general terms in all the years studied.42 
Of the solo operators, the majority (66%) are involved in domestic THB, whereas for the iso-
lated groups this figure is 24%. Virtually all criminal networks (97%) are involved in cross-
border THB. 
 
 
3.5 Victims in investigations 
 
3.5.1 Reports 
 
Table 3.15 contains an overview of the number of victims who reported an offence or made a 
witness statement, divided by year and type of THB (cross-border or domestic). This only con-
cerns the investigations ‘referred’ to the PPS; victims reporting an offence whose case was not 
taken up or completed are not shown here.

are however clear clusters based on geographical proximity, family ties, friendships, trade links and mutually re-
lated activities”. In the case of THB, clusters develop around recruitment in specific countries, the transport to the 
Netherlands (i.e. the middlemen) and the prostitution of victims in one or more countries/cities. Victims are bought 
and sold on, and often recruited and/or put to work in more than one country. 

40  In this classification it concerns not the number of suspects, but the number of persons involved. 
41  The organisation type could not be ascertained for two investigations in 2002 and one investigation in 2003. 
42  The percentage of suspects who formed part of a criminal network, an isolated group or acted as a solo operator re-

spectively were: 76%, 16%, 7% (2000); 75%, 13%, 11% (2001); 60%, 25%, 15% (2002); 67%, 20%, 13% (2003).

2001. The average number of reports/witness statements in each investigation also fell. The av-

tic THB.

In 2003, (also) underage victims were involved in one-third of the investigations into THB. This 
percentage is higher than in the previous year, but lower than in 2001 and 2000.  
For the year 2003, it was examined how many minors were involved in investigations. The in-
vestigations that were completed in that year came across 20 underage victims, of which 19 re-
ported the offence. 
In investigations into domestic THB, underage victims are involved much more often than in 
investigations into cross-border THB (51% compared to 30%).47 This is the case in each of the 
years studied.48

Table 3.17 contains, in order of declining frequency, an overview of the most common coun-
tries of origin of the victims whom the investigations came across.49 In the table, N refers to the 
number of investigations and not the number of victims. An overview of all countries of origin 
is included in Appendix 2 (Table B3.17). Since victims from several countries may be involved 
in a single investigation, the table does not add up to 100%.

In 2003, as in 2002, Bulgaria was the most frequently occurring country of origin of victims in 
successfully completed investigations. There was however a sharp rise in the number of investi-
gations where the victims were from Romania. The number of investigations involving Nige-
rian victims was low in 2003 and 2002 compared to the previous years. 
 
Taking all the countries of origin into consideration, there were a relative large number of vic-
tims from the Balkans in the investigations completed in 2003, as was also the case in 2002.50 
In addition, many victims were recruited in the Netherlands. There was a relative decline in the 
number of investigations involving recruitment in Eastern Europe51 and the Baltic states52.  
 
Country of origin without visa requirement 
It was examined to what extent in investigations into cross-border THB the victims come from 
countries with or without a visa requirement. For this purpose, the visa status of the countries of 
origin at the start of the investigation was taken. The result is shown for each year in Table 
3.18. This table distinguishes between investigations whereby recruitment takes place in coun-
tries with a visa requirement, countries without a visa requirement and in both.

3.6 Investigation methods and process 
 
3.6.1 Investigation methods used 
 
Table 3.19 contains an overview of the investigation methods used in completed investigations 
into THB, in order of declining frequency. Questions on this were only asked for the years 2002 
and 2003. For the year 2003 the questions were more detailed, so that the results from these two 
years are not entirely comparable.  
Incidentally, the question was also asked whether a financial criminal investigation was carried 
out. The results concerning financial criminal investigations are discussed in the following 
paragraph.

The results for the year 2003 correspond - in general terms and in so far as comparable - with 
the results for 2002. However, a relatively larger number of requests for legal assistance were 
submitted in 2003. 
 
3.6.2 Financial aspects 
 
A financial criminal investigation is where specific attention is given to (identifying) the profits 
obtained through crime and the way in which these could be confiscated. This implies the use of 
financial and administrative tools and assessing investigation information from a financial and 
technical point of view. 
Based on financial investigation, it may be decided during or after such an investigation to cal-
culate the perpetrators’ illegally obtained benefit and to try to confiscate this benefit. In order to 
do so, first a criminal financial investigation (CFI) is carried out. Table 3.20 shows how often 
financial investigations were made in the investigations into THB studied, how often a CFI was 
opened and how often this - in so far as (already) known to the police - led to a confiscation 
procedure. Information about criminal financial investigations has been collected from 2002 
onwards. In a number of cases it was still under consideration whether or not to open a CFI 
and/or to institute confiscation proceedings. These cases are not included in the table.

In 2003 almost half of the investigations into THB, according to those interviewed, a financial 
investigation was carried out. In 2002, the relative number of investigations in which a criminal 
financial investigation was carried out, was just as high. 
In almost one-quarter of the investigations a CFI was opened in 2003. This percentage is a little 
lower than in previous years. The percentage of investigations whereby the CFI resulted in the 
calculation of illegally obtained benefit and - in so far as (already) known to the police - confis-
cation proceedings, was much lower in the year 2003 than in previous years. The persons inter-
viewed would appear to be increasingly not always aware of this, because financial investiga-
tions are also carried out by other specialist departments and agencies.55  
 
Illegally obtained benefit 
The illegally obtained benefit for the five suspects in 2003 for whom this has been calculated 
and is known, is almost €1,000,000 (rounded off). On average the illegally obtained benefit per 
suspect in the year studied is €200,000 (rounded off). The average illegally obtained benefit per 
suspect varies from year to year, and was €104,953 in 2000, €210,999 in 2001, €115,384 in 
2002 and €193,776 in 2003.56 
 
Claim from victims for compensation 
It was examined whether victims have made an attempt through civil proceedings or through a 
‘joinder of the injured party in criminal proceedings’ to recover (some) of the money they 
earned, or to obtain compensation for damage (actually) incurred. This was found - in so far as 
known - to be so in 3 cases in 2003. In 2002 there were 4 cases, 10 cases in 2001 and 2 cases in 
2002.

4 The Public Prosecution Service and prosecution 
 
 
4.1 Introduction 
 
This chapter contains the results of (secondary) analyses of THB cases within the public prose-
cutor’s national database for the period 2000 to 2003.1 Per year it was examined how many 
cases were registered with the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), were dealt with by the depart-
ment or were settled in court (i.e. no cohort was followed).2 The explanation of the research 
methods used can be found in Appendix 3.  
 
 
4.2 THB cases registered with the Public Prosecution Service 
 
During the period from 2000 to 2003, 625 criminal cases in which suspicion of THB (Article 
250ter or Article 250a of the Criminal Code) was solely or partly the case were registered with 
the PPS.3 A (criminal) case in the context of prosecution is understood to mean the case against 
a single suspect. 
Table 4.1 shows for each year how many cases it concerns and how many of these cases (in so 
far as is known) (also) involved underage victims.4 
 

Table 4.1 Number of cases registered5 and cases that (also) involve underage victims, per annum 
Year Registered cases Cases that (also) involve underage victims

2002 2006 27 13% 
2003 157 38 24% 
Total 625 129 21% 
 
The considerable increase in the number of registered cases that was seen in 2002 did not con-
tinue into 2003. The number in 2003 was however still significantly higher than in the first two 
years of this century. Both the number and the proportion of cases that (also) involved underage 
victims increased in 2003 compared to the two previous years. Over the total period from 2000 
to 2003, more than 20% of the number of cases (also) involved underage victims. NB: this says 
nothing about the number of underage victims involved. 
 

                                                           
1  This was carried out by SiBa, WODC. 
2  It therefore does not concern exactly the same cases each time, because not all cases are registered, dealt with by 

the PPS and settled in court in the same year. 
3  Including cases that were later dropped by the PPS or in which the charge ultimately does not contain a suspicion 

of THB. 
4  Criterion: registration under paragraphs and subparagraphs of the THB provision in the Criminal Code that imply 

underage victims. However, underage victims may well come under different paragraphs and subparagraphs of this 
provision, so this is almost certain to be an underestimate of their numbers.  

5  Including cases transferred (to another district) (a total of 4 in this period). 
6  This is one less than was found in earlier analyses of this same year and than reported in the previous report. The 

difference is caused by small shifts in numbers that are the result of corrections in PPS data after the reference date 
of the earlier analyses. Since consistent use has been made of the new analyses for this report, there are a few small 
differences with earlier reports.

A division by paragraphs within the THB provision in the Criminal Code gives the following 
results in Table 4.2. 
 
Table 4.2 Type of THB, per year of registration

The vast majority of THB cases concern Article 250a or 250ter paragraph 2, i.e. THB whereby 
two or more persons act in association, or a victim is involved who is younger than 16 years, or 
serious physical injury is inflicted. Cases that are registered under Article 250ter or 250a para-
graph 17 also occur, but in the period of four years under study no case at all was registered un-
der Article 250ter/a paragraph 3. 
 
The crime of THB is often committed in combination with other offences, such as people 
smuggling, (attempted) rape or complicity in rape, possession or use of weapons, (attempted) 
deliberate deprivation of liberty or complicity in such, and offences to do with drugs, making 
and using fake or forged travel documents, abuse and threats.NRM3  A case may therefore con-
cern several offences.  
Table 4.3 gives an overview of the most serious offences in each case. This categorisation 
adopted by Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek - CBS), whereby the of-
fence with the most severe punishment ‘will take precedence’, has been modified for this pur-
pose in the sense that a separate category has been created for THB (under the CBS’s categori-
sation, THB comes in the category of ‘other crimes’) and in the case of a combination of crimes 
bearing equal punishment, THB is taken as the most serious crime and included in the over-
view.8

7  This could be regarded as the simplest form of THB: not committed in association with others, no victims younger 

than 16 years involved and no serious physical injury inflicted. This qualification, however, does not detract in any 
way from the seriousness of the crime in itself. 

8  Should there still be several crimes with the same punishment, a crime registered earlier will take precedence. 
9  E.g. (THB in combination with) fraud, corruption of a public official, making false charges, bigamy, getting an un-

derage person drunk or withdrawal of  an underage person from parental authority.NRM3 



THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE AND PROSECUTION 27 

 

In 2003, THB was the only or the most serious crime in 84% of the cases registered. The other 
cases involved an even more serious crime besides THB: usually a form of sexual violence 
(9%) such as indecent assault or rape. 
If one looks at the total period from 2000 to 2003, THB is the only or the most serious crime 
registered in 85% of cases. In most cases, it involves Article 250ter/a paragraph 2. The increase 
identified in the previous report in the number of cases in which Article 250ter/a paragraph 1 
forms the most serious crime did not continue. 
It could be added here that in 25% of the cases, participation in a criminal organisation was also 
registered.10 
  
Considering the above, the THB cases registered would seem to have become more serious in 
nature: increase in the proportion of cases under Article 250ter/a paragraph 2 (compared to Ar-
ticle 250ter/a paragraph 1, a rise in the proportion of cases where an underage victim is (also) 
involved and - compared to 2001 and 2002 - a rise in the proportion of cases in which participa-
tion in a criminal organisation is (also) involved. 
 
  
4.3 The suspects 
 
Age 
In 75% of the cases registered in 2003, the age of the suspects at the time of the first THB of-
fence11 was between 18 and 41 years. Their average age was 33 years12 and there were 7 under-
age suspects (4%).13 
 
Country of origin 
The suspects come from more than 50 countries. Table 4.4 contains (in alphabetical order) the 
most common countries of origin.14 See Table B4.4 in Appendix 2 for a complete overview.

Once again in 2003, the Netherlands is the most frequently occurring country of birth and the 
share of suspects born in the Netherlands also increased in proportion. What is striking is the 
large proportion of suspects born in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey (each at least 10%), but of 
these three countries only the Romanian share grew in 2003. In addition, the number of suspects 
from the former Soviet Union and Surinam grew in that year; the increase and substantial pro-
portion of Albanian suspects identified in 2002 did not continue.  
 
Table 4.5 contains for each year the ranking of the five most frequently occurring countries of 
birth of the suspects.15

The overview shows a constant first place for the Netherlands as the country of birth of sus-
pects, and a relatively stable ‘position’ of Turkey and (to a slightly lesser extent) Bulgaria and 
(former) Yugoslavia. Nigeria would seem to have become less important as a country of origin. 
 
Gender 
Most suspects are male; in 76% of cases in 2003. However there are clear differences between 
the countries of origin. Limited to the five most frequently occurring countries of origin of the 
suspects, it is noticeable that among the Turkish suspects there are hardly any women (just one). 
Of the Romanian suspects, 45% are women. The other three most frequently occurring coun-
tries of origin occupy an intermediate position.16

Table 4.6 contains, by year of registration, an overview of the number of cases in which the sus-
pect was held in pre-trial detention.

The number of cases dealt with is rising each year. The summons was once again in 2003 by far 
the most frequently used method. It was usually (also) THB summons (68% of cases dealt with) 
and sometimes summons solely for other offences (6% of all cases dealt with). In 22% of the 
cases, it was decided unconditionally not to prosecute. These decisions were made above all be-
cause of the unlikelihood of a conviction (technical dismissal).21 The other forms of completion 
(transfer, conditional decision not to prosecute and out-of-court settlement) are only applied 
sporadically. 
 
 
4.5 Settlement by the court 
 
To recapitulate: in the period from 2000 to 2003, 625 cases were registered with the PPS in 
which THB was (also) suspected. In the same period 606 cases were dealt with by the PPS, as 

                                                           
17  The difference is caused by the fact that the PPS does not always take a decision to prosecute in the same year that 

the case is registered. 
18  Summons only or also for THB.  
19  Cases whereby, despite earlier suspicions of THB, ultimately no charge of THB was made. 
20  To another district or abroad. 
21  The ground for deciding not to prosecute (technical dismissal) is usually ‘no legal evidence’ (46%), followed some 

way behind by ‘wrongly reported as a suspect’ (15%). ‘Minor share in the offence’ (11%) and ‘old offence’ (7%) 
are the most common grounds for policy decisions not to prosecute (policy dismissal).

were a total of 382 cases dealt with in the courts (of the first instance) in which THB was (also) 
the charge.22 Table 4.8 gives an overview of the court decisions by year of settlement.

cases ended in an acquittal, and an equal number of cases were joined in court. In one case, the 
PPS was inadmissible.

22  These are therefore not necessarily the same cases as those registered with the PPS or dealt with by the PPS during 

the same period. Cases that were registered with the PPS as (also) THB, but in which the summons was issued for 
only other offences (in the period from 2000 to 2003 there were 36 cases) are no longer included from now on.  

23  ‘Offences against property’ are not included in this overview, because no charge was brought for this and/or the 
court had not yet reached a judgement in such a case.  



THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE AND PROSECUTION 31 

 

A word of warning when interpreting this table: for the sake of completeness, percentages as 
well as figures are given. Because of the far-reaching subdivision, however, some cell combina-
tions are so low that the percentages are not very meaningful. What can be deduced from the ta-
ble, however - besides the concrete figures, of course - is the following: 

- In 2003 in all (nine) cases in which sexual violence was the most serious crime a sen-
tence was passed. This also occurred in 91% of the cases where Article 250a paragraph 
1 was the most serious crime, and in 89% of the cases for Article 250a paragraph 2; 

- If one looks, in the period from 2000 to 2003, at the cases in which Article 250ter/a 
paragraph 2 was the most serious crime, the percentage of cases ending in a sentence 
rises slightly over time. 

 
Until recently the PPS data contained only information on the nature of the settlement in rela-
tion to the summons and not in relation to the crimes for which a suspect was ultimately sen-
tenced. However, this has changed slightly. Although the registration of whether or not each of-
fence ends with a court conviction is not yet entirely flawless,24 the information does show that 
in a significant number of cases (in 2003 this would appear to be 16 of the 106, i.e. 15%) a sen-
tence did ensue, but not for THB (which was also one of the charges). The crimes for which a 
sentence was indeed imposed were (sometimes in combination) smuggling of human beings, 
sexual abuse of underage persons, rape, abuse, threat of violence, forgery of documents or fake 
travel documents, participation in a criminal organisation, violation of the Opium Act and/or 
violation of the Weapons and Ammunition Act.  
 
Table 4.10 gives an overview of the sentences imposed, once again for the crime that carries the 
heaviest punishment.25

24  This is evident from a number of inconsistencies in the information.  
25  The 16 cases in which ultimately no conviction of the crime of THB followed also form part of the overview. 
26  ‘Offences against property’ are lacking in this overview, because no charge was brought for this and/or the court 

had not yet reached a judgement in such a case. 
27  With cases in the category ‘no principal sentence’, an additional penalty (e.g. confiscation) or an order (e.g. hospi-

tal order) may have been imposed. The term ‘additional penalty’, incidentally, is somewhat misleading. Contrary to 
what the term seems to suggest, the court may limit itself to imposing an additional penalty.

Because of the many empty cells, some percentages are not very meaningful. What the table 
does make clear, though - apart from the concrete figures - is the following: 



THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE AND PROSECUTION 33 

 

- In 2003 in 81% of all cases in which (whether or not in combination with another crime) 
THB was involved and the court imposed a sentence, a custodial sentence was imposed, 
sometimes in combination with another sentence or order;28 

- this percentage was somewhere between 81% and 86% annually in the period from 2000 to 
2003; 

- in 2003, in 83% of all cases in which Article 250ter/a paragraph 2 was the most serious 
crime and a sentence was imposed, that sentence was a custodial sentence.29 

 
Table 4.11 gives for each crime (combination) the average duration of the custodial sentences 
imposed, as well as the associated standard deviations.30 The total of 15 cases in which ‘other 
violence’, ‘vandalism/public order’ or ‘other crimes under the Criminal Code’ were the most se-
rious crime, have only been included in calculating the total (bottom row of the table), because 
the numbers are too small for separate averages or standard deviations to be calculated for them.

In 2003, calculated for all cases in which THB was (also) involved, a custodial sentence averag-
ing two years was imposed (see bottom row of the table). The highest average custodial sen-
tence was imposed where sexual violence was the most serious crime (1514 days, or more than 
four years). With THB Article 250ter/a paragraph 1 as the most serious crime, an average of 
more than 14 months was imposed (428 days) and with THB Article 250ter/a paragraph 2 as the 
most serious crime an average of almost 20 months (599 days). 
 
PPS data contains only information on settlement in the first instance, as well as on whether an 
appeal has been lodged in a case, and by whom. Table 4.12 gives an overview.

The table shows that in 2003 an appeal was lodged in 46% of the cases, usually by the suspect. 
Viewed over the period from 2000 to 2003, the number of appeals lodged by the Public Prose-
cutor was relatively high in 2002. 

                                                           
28  Only a custodial sentence in 72% of cases, a custodial sentence plus fine in 2% of cases and a custodial sentence 

plus community service order in 7% of cases.  
29  Only a custodial sentence in 72% of cases, a custodial sentence plus community service order in 9% of cases and a 

custodial sentence and fine in 2% of cases. 
30  These give an idea of the extent to which the term varies in the different cases for which an average has been calcu-

lated (the higher the SD, the greater the variation). For a further explanation see Appendix 4. 





 

5  Summary 
 
5.1 Introduction 
 
Several developments in the area of (combating) THB since the publication of the previous re-
port are worth mentioning. For example, the National Action Plan on THB was drawn up and 
the old article on THB, Article 250a in the Criminal Code, that originally only covered exploita-
tion in the sex industry was replaced by Article 273a that covers exploitation in the sex industry 
and exploitation in other sectors of work and services, as well as certain activities focusing on 
the removal of human organs. The B9 regulation for victims/witnesses has been modified in 
line with this and BNRM’s field of work is expected to be broadened accordingly. In anticipa-
tion of this, BNRM has started up a study into ‘other exploitation’ in order to find out whether, 
and if so in which sectors and on what scale, such modern forms of slavery occur in the Nether-
lands. In addition, in the first half of 2005 an Information Centre for Youth Prostitution (Infor-
matiepunt Jeugdprostitutie) and - in cooperation with the National Crime Squad - the Expertise 
Centre for Trafficking in Human Beings/Human Smuggling (Expertisecentrum Mensenhan-
del/Mensensmokkel) were started up. Efforts have also been made to improve the implementa-
tion of the B9 regulation in practice and the PPS has set up three working groups in view of the 
recent broadening of THB legislation. 
There are matters of concern too, though, such as the reduction in subsidies for public organisa-
tions in the policy areas of prostitution and (combating) THB, the fall in the number of success-
fully completed investigations into THB in 2003, and also the decline in the number of suspects 
arrested and ‘referred’ in each investigation. In addition, the National Police Project on Prostitu-
tion and Trafficking in Human Beings (Projectgroep Prostitutie Mensenhandel/de Nederlandse 
Politie - PPM/dNP) did not meet for several months, and there are frequent signs that in certain 
regions, partly due to capacity problems, only sporadic inspections are made of sex establish-
ments. There is therefore some doubt whether the fight against exploitation in the sex industry 
is being given sufficient priority and capacity on a continuous basis, both through the adminis-
trative inspections by the municipalities in the licensed sector as well as in investigations and 
prosecutions - within and outside that sector. Enforcement - both administrative and criminal - 
remains an important issue, also in the light of the broadening of the definition of THB, which 
requires watchfulness for potential exploitation within a much wider scale of work situations. 
 
This fourth report does not go further into the above-mentioned issues; it contains statistical 
data up to and including 2003.1 This chapter contains the summary. The information concerning 
victims of THB that have been reported to the STV, police investigations into THB, prosecution 
by the PPS and settlement in the courts, is grouped under the headings of investigation, prose-
cution, victims and suspects. 
 
 
5.2 Investigation 
 
5.2.1 Number and type of investigations 
 
The number of investigations into THB successfully completed by the police rose from 48 in 
2001 to 55 in 2002, but fell in 2003 to 42. This fall concerned investigations into both cross-
border and domestic THB and the proportion of both types remained virtually the same in this

36 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 

period (in 2003: 76% and 24% respectively).2 The number of investigations focusing on win-
dow and club prostitution fell in 2003 compared to previous years. The proportion of investiga-
tions focusing on the escort sector remained virtually the same, and the proportion of investiga-
tions into street prostitution rose slightly in 2003. 
 
Of the investigations in 2003, 41% concerned (parts of) networks; this is a slight rise compared 
to 2002 (34%), but does not reach the level of 2001 (58%). Just as in 2002, one-third of the in-
vestigations in 2003 involved solo suspects, whereas a quarter concerned isolated groups. 
 
5.2.2 Reason for the investigations 
 
The reasons for investigations into domestic THB differ significantly from those for investiga-
tions into cross-border THB. With domestic THB a report of an offence is much more fre-
quently the reason for an investigation than with cross-border THB (55% compared to 26%). 
With cross-border THB, inspections are more often the reason (23% compared to 10%). The 
number of investigations for reasons other than those mentioned rose in the period from 2001 to 
2003. In 2003 these were often reports from witnesses. 
 
5.2.3 Investigation methods used 
 
As well as the (standard) interviewing of suspects and victims, in virtually all investigations 
successfully completed in 2003 information from police databases was used and witness inves-
tigations were carried out. In more than half of the investigations a technical investigation took 
place, observations were made and/or telecommunication methods were tapped or information 
from providers was requested. In one-third of the investigations, requests for legal assistance 
were made. 
 
5.2.4  Financial aspects 
 
According to the police, in 2003 a financial investigation was conducted in more than half of 
the investigations into THB. This applied in general terms for 2002 as well. The percentage of 
investigations in which a criminal financial investigation (CFI) was subsequently opened fell 
from about 30% in the years 2000 to 2002 to almost a quarter in 2003. There was a much 
sharper fall compared to previous years in the number of investigations whereby the CFI led to 
the calculation of illegally obtained benefit and confiscation proceedings. This percentage fell 
to 23% (2000: 63%; 2001: 93% and 2002: 56%). The average amount of illegally obtained 
benefit calculated per suspect was a little less than €200,000 in 2003, and varies widely from 
year to year (more than €100,000 in 2000 and 2002, more than €200,000 in 2001). The number 
of cases in which victims attempted to obtain compensation for material and immaterial loss 
suffered by them, either through civil proceedings or as a joinder of the injured party also fluc-
tuated widely: in 2003 this occurred in 3 cases, in the years 2000 to 2002 there were 2, 10 and 4 
cases respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 

                                                           
2  Incidentally, provisional figures for 2004 show a sharp rise in the number of investigations completed successfully 

(see Appendix 5). 



SUMMARY  37 

 

5.3 Prosecution 
 
5.3.1 Number and types of cases 
 
In 2003 there were 157 suspects registered with the PPS in which there was the suspicion (only 
or partly) of THB (Article 250ter or Article 250a of the Criminal Code). The sharp rise in the 
number of registered cases (200) that had been observed in 2002 therefore did not continue into 
2003, but the number is still significantly higher than in the first two years of this century 
(2000: 138; 2001: 130).3 Both the number and the proportion of cases in 2003 that (also) con-
cern underage victims rose compared to 2002 to slightly above the level of 2001. This, how-
ever, says nothing about the number of underage victims involved. 
 
During the last three years, most of the THB cases (74%-80%) concerned the second paragraph 
of the THB article; 20-26% concerned the first paragraph, whereas during the past four years no 
case at all was registered under paragraph 3. 
 
THB was the only crime, or the most serious crime, in 84% of the cases registered in 2003. In 
the other cases, there was an (even) more serious crime besides THB, usually a form of sexual 
violence (9%), such as sexual assault or rape. These figures are comparable to those of the three 
previous years. 
 
5.3.2 Cases dealt with by the Public Prosecution Service 
 
In 2003 the PPS dealt with 187 cases in which THB was (only or partly) the case, considerably 
more than in previous years (2000: 94; 2001: 160; 2002: 165). This resulted in a summons in by 
far the majority of cases in 2003, just as in previous years. In more than two-thirds of cases this 
was a summons (also) for THB, sometimes however only a summons for other crimes was is-
sued (6% of all cases dealt with). More than one-fifth of the cases were (unconditionally) 
dropped (dismissal by reason of unlikely conviction). Only occasionally were cases transferred, 
conditionally dropped or settled out of court. 
 
5.3.3 Trial and appeal 
 
The court in the first instance dealt with 117 cases in 2003 in which THB was (also) a charge, a 
larger number than in previous years (2000: 83; 2001: 85; 2002: 97). In the vast majority of 
these cases (91%) the court imposed a sentence (in 2000 and 2001: 87%; in 2002: 88%). Com-
pared to these years, in more than 80% of the cases this was a custodial sentence. The average 
term of these custodial sentences was two years in 2003; if there was a charge of a more serious 
crime besides THB (e.g. sexual violence), the custodial sentence was considerably longer (an 
average of more than four years). When the first paragraph of the THB provision was the most 
serious charge, the custodial sentence was on average more than 14 months, and under para-
graph 2 as the most serious charge, almost 20 months. 4% of the cases in 2003 ended in an ac-
quittal; less often than the previous years. Similarly, 4% of cases were consolidated and in one 
case the PPS was inadmissible. 
Over the years an appeal has been lodged in slightly less than half of the THB cases judged in 
the first instance, usually only by the suspect, often also by the PPS and only very occasionally 
by the PPS alone. 

                                                           
3 Provisional figures show that the number of suspects registered with the PPS rose once again in 2004 (see Appen-

dix 5). 



38 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 

5.4 Victims 
 
5.4.1 Victims registered with the STV 
 
257 victims were reported to the Foundation against Trafficking in Women (Stichting Tegen 
Vrouwenhandel - STV) in 2003; significantly fewer than in 2002 (343) and even fewer than in 
2001 (284), the year in which it was difficult to reach the STV.4 Just as in previous years, in 
2003 most of the victims by far (52%) came from Central and Eastern Europe, with Bulgaria, 
followed by Romania with an increasing number, being the main countries of origin. The num-
ber of reports of victims originating from Africa fell slightly, but was still a considerable 25% 
in 2003 with victims from Nigeria accounting for the largest group. The other victims came 
from Asia, Western Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean in equal proportions, with the 
growing number of victims from Brazil being particularly striking. 
 
Over the years, most victims that have been reported to the STV are in the age category from 18 
to 23 years, and this was no different for 2003. The number of underage victims reported to the 
STV (10 to 17 years) was 20 in that year, fewer than in previous years (2001: 27; 2002: 41). 
The number of victims whose age was unknown fell in 2003 to 16%. STV received no reports 
of male victims in 2003. 
 
5.4.2 Victims in the IKP-S victim registration system 
 
Regional police forces register (possible) victims of THB in the IKP-S victim registration sys-
tem. Some of these victims emerged during administrative inspections in the prostitution sector, 
while others came in contact with the police in other ways, for instance because they themselves 
went to the police. This registration is not comprehensive. In 2003 the police registered 153 
(possible) victims in IKP-S, considerably less than in 2002 (371). In 2003 more than a fifth 
(22%) of these victims came from Bulgaria and 14% from Romania. In addition, the Nether-
lands and Nigeria had a relatively high score as countries of origin. The percentage of victims 
born in the Netherlands rose strongly compared to 2002: from 4% to 12%. 
 
Also most victims registered in IKP-S are in the age category of 18 to 23 years. In 2003 21 mi-
nors were registered, compared to 51 in 2002. As a proportion of the total, this was 14% in both 
years. As far as the other age categories are concerned, the percentages in both years are also 
virtually the same. With regard to gender, in 2003 two (Ecuadorian) men were registered, 
whereas in 2002 this was 13, all originating from countries outside the European Union (EU). 
Twelve of them were minors. 
 
5.4.3 Victim information from the investigations 
 
Numbers and countries of origin 
The number of victims and/or witnesses who reported an offence or made a witness statement 
in 2003 fell sharply to 155 compared to 258 in 2002 and 186 in 2001. In the investigations 
completed in 2003, as in 2002, there was a relatively high proportion of victims from the Bal-
kans. In addition, many victims were recruited in Western Europe (the Netherlands in virtually 
all cases), whereas the number of investigations whereby victims were recruited in Eastern 
Europe and the Baltic states declined in relative terms. As in 2002, Bulgaria was the most fre-

                                                           
4  Incidentally, figures relating to 2004 show a sharp rise in the number of victims reported to the STV (see Appendix 

5). 



SUMMARY  39 

 

quently occurring country of origin of victims in the investigations successfully completed in 
2003. However, there was a sharp rise in the number of investigations concerning cases with 
victims from Romania. The number of investigations into cases with Nigerian victims was low 
in 2003 and 2002 compared to earlier years. 
 
Underage victims 
In 2003, one-third of investigations into THB (also) involved underage victims. Over the years, 
there have been significantly more investigations into domestic THB than into cross-border 
THB (in 2003 51% compared to 30%). In real numbers, in the investigations completed suc-
cessfully in 2003 there were 20 underage victims, 19 of whom reported the offence. No infor-
mation is known about the victims’ gender in successfully completed investigations. 
 
Means of coercion used 
(The threat of) violence plays an important role in bringing victims into prostitution and keep-
ing them there, as does keeping them under surveillance and/or locking them up and imposing 
debts on them. However, the first means of coercion is used in both cross-border and domestic 
THB, whereas the last two are used particularly in cross-border THB. The rise in the number of 
investigations in 2002 in which ‘feigned love’ was used (by ‘loverboys’) to bring victims into 
prostitution, did not continue in 2003. In more than a quarter of cases this method was used 
(compared to 53% in 2002). The method, as also became clear earlier, is not used exclusively in 
domestic THB: of the 11 cases in 2003 where there was ‘feigned love’, 5 concerned cross-
border and 6 domestic THB. 
 
Not all victims are forced to do sex work. Sometimes the element of exploitation ‘only’ in-
volves confiscating earnings. Of the 37 cases in 2003 whereby the trafficker confiscated money, 
according to the victims themselves 13 of them (35%) were allowed or able to keep some of the 
money for themselves. In the other cases, however, the victims had to hand over everything. 
 
Victims put to work 
Victims may be put to work in prostitution within and outside the Netherlands. Victims who are 
recruited abroad are more often brought into prostitution outside the Netherlands (and outside 
the country of origin) than victims who are recruited in the Netherlands. The former were put to 
work primarily in the neighbouring countries of Germany and Belgium, whereas the second 
group also ended up in other countries, including Italy in particular. The downward trend in the 
number of investigations whereby victims were brought into prostitution outside the Nether-
lands as well, continued into 2003: from more than half at the start of the century to more than 
40% in 2002 to one-third in 2003. 
 
Documents 
Victims found in investigations into cross-border THB increasingly possess a valid passport; the 
percentage of investigations whereby victims had a fake passport therefore declined (further). 
Nevertheless, in almost one-third of cases in 2003 there were still one or more victims with a 
fake passport. In 2002 and 2003 this concerned in (more than) half of the cases fake passports 
of EU member states. No fake visas were found in any of the investigations in 2003. 
 
 
 
 
 
 



40 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 

5.5 Suspects 
 
5.5.1 Investigations and suspects 
 
Number of suspects 
The police identified a total of 148 suspects of THB, arrested 135 and ‘referred’ 127 to the PPS 
in the investigations successfully completed in 2003. The number of arrested and ‘referred’ sus-
pects was therefore considerably lower than in the two previous years and comparable with the 
level in 2000. The average number of arrested suspects in each investigation also fell (further) 
in 2003. This fall was almost 50% for investigations into cross-border THB (from 6.8 in 2000 
to 3.6 in 2003), and one-third for investigations into domestic THB (from 3.0 in 2000 to 2.0 in 
2003). 
 
Level of organisation 
Of the suspects arrested in 2003, 69% formed part of a network, 19% of an isolated group and 
12% were solo operators, a division that can be seen - in general terms - in all the years since 
2000. Of the solo operators in 2003, the majority (66%) were engaged in domestic THB and of 
the isolated groups this was 24%. Virtually all criminal networks (97%) were engaged in cross-
border THB. 
 
Arrested recruiters 
With cross-border THB, not all the persons suspected of involvement in THB are tracked down 
and prosecuted. Recruiters in particular often remain out of reach in such cases, although this 
was less often the case in 2002 and 2003 than in previous years. The percentage of investiga-
tions into cross-border THB, whereby all recruiters were arrested was in fact much higher in 
2003, just as in 2002, than in previous years: 50% or more. Moreover, in a further fifth of the 
investigations, some of the recruiters were arrested. This does not alter the fact that in more than 
a quarter of cases no recruiters were arrested at all. With investigations into domestic THB, on 
the other hand, the recruiters are virtually always arrested. These are in fact often those who 
also bring the victims into prostitution and exploit them there.  
 
Countries of origin 
The most common nationalities of suspects identified in investigations in 2003 are Dutch, Ro-
manian and Bulgarian. The proportion of the various nationalities has fluctuated considerably 
over the years. For example, the number of suspects of Romanian nationality in 2003 increased 
sharply, to almost one-fifth. The proportion of Bulgarian suspects was slightly less. The number 
of arrested suspects of Albanian nationality, on the other hand - after a peak in 2002 - declined 
(sharply). The number of Nigerian suspects was low in 2003 (as in 2002) compared to the pre-
vious years. The proportion of Dutch suspects was consistently around 40%. Also when one 
considers the countries of birth of the suspects, the Netherlands, Romania and Bulgaria formed 
the top three and the rise in the number of suspects from Romania and fall in the number from 
Albania is particularly striking. Compared with the figures on nationality, the number of sus-
pects with a Turkish or Surinamese background rose. If we look at the type of THB these per-
sons are suspected of, it is noticeable that virtually all the suspects born in Morocco and the 
Dutch Antilles (94% and 92% respectively) were suspected of domestic THB. This applies to 
64% of suspects born in Surinam. Suspects from other foreign countries were exclusively (Bul-
garia, Romania, the Russian Federation, Nigeria, Ghana and Belgium) or in most cases (Turkey, 
Albania, former Yugoslavia and Ukraine) suspected of cross-border THB.  
Of the suspects of non-Dutch nationality, 38% were residing legally in the Netherlands at the 
time of their arrest (2003). The number of foreign suspects who were residing illegally in the 



SUMMARY  41 

 

Netherlands at the time of their arrest rose considerably in the period from 2000 to 2003, from 
10% in 2000 to 42% in 2001, 48% in 2002 and 62% in 2003. The share of foreign suspects re-
siding legally in the Netherlands fell in inverse proportion. 
 
Proprietors 
Among the suspects arrested in 2003, 22 were proprietors of sex establishments: 6 of which 
were licensed. In 5 of these 6 cases, the suspicion was reported to the municipality which had 
issued the licence, which led to administrative proceedings against 4 proprietors. In the percep-
tion of the police, there is a certain level of awareness of the exploitative situation among the 
proprietors of sex establishments that come to the fore in one way or another in an investiga-
tion. During the years 2002 and 2003, half of these proprietors were typified as ‘aware of, but 
not actively cooperating in the exploitation’, and 10% worked actively as traffickers in human 
beings. The latter type rose dramatically in 2003, whereas the former in fact fell sharply. 
 
5.5.2 Suspects prosecuted 
 
In 75% of the cases registered with the PPS in 2003, the age of the suspects was between 18 and 
41 years. Seven were minors. The proportion of minors among the suspects remained the same 
at 4%, compared to the previous years. The average age of the suspects in 2003 was 33 years. 
Once again the Netherlands was the most common country of birth in 2003. The proportion of 
suspects born in the Netherlands increased proportionally compared to 2002, from one-quarter 
to almost one-third; in absolute figures there was a slight fall in numbers. What is noticeable is 
the large proportion of suspects born in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey (each with at least 10%), 
but of these three countries only the Romanian share rose in 2003. In addition, the proportion of 
suspects from the former Soviet Union and Surinam rose in that year; however, the rise in and 
the substantial proportion of Albanian suspects identified in 2000 did not continue into 2003.  
 
Most suspects are male; in 76% of the cases in 2003. The proportion of female suspects has 
fluctuated since 2001 around one-quarter. As far as the gender of the suspects are concerned, 
there are clear differences between the countries of origin. Looking at only the five most com-
mon countries of origin of suspects (the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and the former 
Soviet Union), it is noticeable that there were hardly any women among the Turkish suspects 
(just one), whereas 45% of the Romanian suspects were women. The remaining three countries 
of origin occupy an intermediate position in this respect.

Appendix 3 Explanation of the research methods used 
 
 
1 Introduction 
 
BNRM collects information in a variety of ways. This appendix provides an explanation of the research 
methods used in the BNRM police study and the secondary analyses of the PPS data. 
 
 
2 The BNRM police study 
 
Introduction 
Each year BNRM analyses all investigations into THB that have been completed by the police and ‘re-
ferred’ to the PPS. The results of this study can be found in Chapter 3 (Investigation). 
 
Objectives and research questions 
The purpose of the study is to provide an insight into the way in which THB is committed in the Nether-
lands, by whom and with which type of victims. The research questions are as follows: 
- How many investigations into THB do the police complete in the Netherlands in 2003? 
- How can traffickers in human beings be typified? 
- To what extent do they form (organised) criminal collaborative groups? 
- How is the offence of THB carried out? 
- How can the victims of THB be typified? 
- To what extent and in what way is the prostitution sector involved in THB? 
- How much do traffickers earn from THB? 
- What offences apart from THB are committed by traffickers? 
- In what way is THB investigated? 
- What developments occur over time in relation to THB? 
 
Research method 
For this report, all investigations into THB that were successfully completed in 2003 were collated and 
analysed. The results were then compared with the results from previous years. 
All (police) units that (can) carry out investigations into THB were approached. They were asked to report 
to the researchers all investigations into THB that were completed in 2003, after which the team leaders of 
these investigations were interviewed by telephone. These interviews were carried out using approxi-
mately the same list of questions that was used in earlier years. 
 
Additional remarks 
The investigations analysed for this study concern in principle all investigations into THB that have been 
completed and ‘referred’ to the PPS, and therefore provide a good picture of the situation. However, more 
THB offences are committed than come to the attention of the police and not all investigations are brought 
to a positive conclusion (and ‘referred’ to the PPS). The investigations analysed therefore only give a par-
tial picture of the real situation. How large or representative this part is, is unknown.  
  
 
3 The PPS data 
 
Introduction 
At the request of BNRM, each year analyses are carried out on a ‘THB’ sub-file from the national 
database known as ‘OM-data’, which contains information from the 19 district PPS offices on the 
prosecution of suspects.1 The analyses give a picture of the course of proceedings in the first instance. 
OM-data contains information on cases and offences. Unlike the situation in relation to police 

                                                           
1  The analyses are carried out by SiBa of the WODC.  



56 TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS; FOURTH REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RAPPORTEUR 

 

investigation, a (criminal) case within the context of prosecution is taken to mean the case against a single 
suspect. Criminal cases against individual suspects may involve several criminal offences. The results of 
this study can be found in Chapter 4 (The Public Prosecution Service and prosecution). 
 
Objective and research questions 
The purpose of the study is to provide an insight into the prosecution of suspects of THB in the Nether-
lands. The research questions are as follows: 
- How many cases relating to THB were registered with the PPS in 2003? 
- How often are underage victims involved? 
- How can the suspects be typified as regards gender, age and country of origin? 
- What offences other than THB are they suspected of? 
- How did the PPS deal with cases in 2003? 
- How did the courts settle cases in 2003? 
- How often do the various parties lodge an appeal? 
- What developments are there over time with regard to THB? 
 
Research method 
From the total PPS database a selection was made of cases in which the offence of THB was (also) 
registered. No cohort was followed in the analyses, but each year the number of cases registered, dealt 
with by the PPS and settled by the court are examined.2 
 
Additional remarks 
Only the principal charges are included in OM-data. In addition, sometimes only the first offence in 
several principal charges is registered in OM-data. This means that not only does OM-data provide only a 
limited picture of the total number of THB offences that are committed (namely that part that comes to the 
attention of the police and is ‘referred’ to the PPS), but also that that part of the information that does 
indeed reach the PPS and which may possibly play a role in the course of the prosecution cannot be found 
in OM-data. How much information is lost in this way is not known. 

                                                           
2  This means that it does not necessarily refers to the same cases all the time. 



 

Appendix 4 Notes on tables and statistics 
 
 
Notes on the tables presented 
 
This report includes many tables. Below are some comments that are important for the interpretation of 
these tables. 
Due to rounding, the tables do not always add up to exactly 100%. For the sake of readability the tables 
do, however, always indicate 100%. 
When numbers are set out in a column of a table, in the heading of the relevant column the letter N is used, 
an abbreviation for ‘number’.  
In the tables a dash (-) shows that the number is zero, and a dash (-) also indicates that the corresponding 
percentage is 0%. If the number is higher than zero, but the percentage when rounded comes to 0%, 0% is 
shown. 
 
 
Notes on the statistics used 
 
Standard deviation 
This report sometimes indicates what the average is, for example the average number of suspects in inves-
tigations into THB. In addition, the number (N; see above) and the so-called standard deviation (SD) are 
also always given. The standard deviation indicates the extent to which the numbers on which the average 
is calculated, differ. The higher the standard deviation, the more this is the case. 
 
Index 
In some tables an index is given. The index shows how much the number of - for example suspects - has 
changed in a particular year compared with a base year. The year that is taken as a base year is set at 100. 
An index of higher than 100 indicates a rise with respect to the base year and an index of lower than 100 a 
fall. 
 
Significance 
In this report results for different groups are sometimes compared with one another. If this is the case a 
check is usually made as to whether the difference found is ‘significant’ or not. This is then indicated in 
the text, with in a footnote the corresponding values chi2, df and p. This means that a check has been made 
as to how big the chance is that the difference found is based on coincidence. 
In this report it is assumed that the chance of coincidence may not be greater than 5% - a percentage often 
used among researchers. Exactly how big this chance is, can be seen from the p value indicated in the 
footnote. For example: p<.01 means that the chance of a coincidence is less than 1%. The values chi2 and 
df (this stands for the number of degrees of freedom) are values that are necessary to determine whether 
differences are significant and are not discussed further here. 





 

Appendix 5 A few provisional figures for the year 2004 
 
 
In 2004 the number of reports concerning victims to the STV rose enormously. The STV attributes the rise 
partly to growing attention being given to THB and to the fact that there has been intensive lobbying 
among cooperation partners, as a result of which the police and a few reception facilities have reported 
more frequently.  
A total of 405 (possible) victims1 were reported; in almost half of the cases by the police. A total of 26 re-
ports concerned underage persons. The most common countries of origin of the victims are the Nether-
lands (59), Bulgaria (55), Romania (45) and Nigeria (39). In more than 45% of the cases reported to the 
STV, a report of the crime of THB was made (to the police). (Source: written information from the STV, 
April 2005).  
 
In 2004 more than 70 police investigations into THB were completed successfully, in the sense that sus-
pects were ‘referred’ to the PPS. (Source: provisional count from BNRM survey of investigations into 
THB completed successfully in 2004). 
 
220 suspects of THB were registered with the PPS in 2004: 178 men (81%), and 39 women (18%).2 The 
most common country of birth is the Netherlands (92 suspects), followed by Turkey (24), Romania (23) 
and Bulgaria (14). Most suspects are aged between 18 and 40 years (79%), while four suspects were mi-
nors. 
In 73% of the cases, the suspicion concerned Article 250a/ter paragraph 2, while in all other cases this was 
Article 250a/ter paragraph 1. 
In 14% of the cases, according to the charges, an underage victim was involved. 
In 80% of the cases, THB is the only or most serious crime. In the other cases, besides THB there was an 
(even) more serious crime involved, usually sexual violence (11%), or other forms of violence (6%). 
(Source: provisional printout of PPS data). 

                                                           
1  A number of witness informants are included in the 405 persons registered. The information on the (criminal) re-

ports shows that there are at least 11. Incidentally, it should not be ruled out that they are also victims of THB. 
2  The gender of three suspects is not known.
