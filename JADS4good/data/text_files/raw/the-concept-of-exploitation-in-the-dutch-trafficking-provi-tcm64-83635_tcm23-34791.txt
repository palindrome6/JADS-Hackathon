Trafficking in Human Beings: The concept of exploitation in the Dutch 
trafficking provision1 
Dien Korvinus, Dagmar Koster and Heleen de Jonge van Ellemeet2 
 
Trafficking in human beings (THB) is regarded both in the Netherlands and internationally as 
a serious crime and a violation of the victim’s human rights. Combating THB must be given 
the highest priority. However, which activities exactly should be combated then? The new 
provision on THB in the Dutch Criminal Code which entered into force on 1 January 20053 
has led to a considerable broadening of the behaviour that can be regarded as THB. Yet, the 
legislator has not defined precisely enough the legal terms that appear in the broadened 
article of the Criminal Code, leaving it to those who implement the provision in practice to 
draw the line. As a result, the new provision on THB cannot automatically stand the test of 
the ‘lex certa’ criterion. For the area of exploitation in other sectors than the sex industry, it 
contains undesirable loose ends. This article by the Bureau of the Dutch Rapporteur on THB 
sets out markers for a more precise definition.4  
 
Introduction 
On 1 January 2005, the new criminal provision on trafficking in human beings (THB) entered 
into force. It encompasses legislation for the implementation of international regulations and 
to a large extent it follows the wording of the Palermo Protocol5 and the EU Council 
Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings.6 It is also partly modelled 
after the old Article 250a of the Criminal Code.7 In addition to conduct already criminalised 
as an offence under Article 250a, exploitation in other work or services (hereinafter referred 
to as ‘other forms of exploitation’) and the forced removal of human organs come within the 
reach of the new trafficking provision. The result is a broad and complex provision that needs 
to be translated into practice in more concrete terms. 
This particularly applies to the central term of exploitation. Exploitation is the ultimate aim of 
the acts which, in relation to adults in combination with certain means of coercion,8 are a

as of 1 September 2006. As regards the content of the provision, no changes were introduced. The text 
of the provision as it reads today is annexed to this paper.

provision, which the Bureau of the Dutch Rapporteur on THB organised on 1 December 2005.

prostitution business were criminal offences. 
8 Means of coercion summarised in article 273f paragraph 1 sub 1 of the Criminal Code: coercion, 
force or other act of violence or through the threat of force or other act of violence, extortion, fraud, 
deception or through the abuse of authority arising from actual circumstances, the abuse of a vulnerable 
position or by giving or receiving payments or benefits in order to obtain the consent of a person who 
has power over another person.

criminal offence under Article 273f paragraph 1 sub 1.9 In the Explanatory Memorandum to 
the provision,10 the legislator has left it to the courts to further define ‘other forms of 
exploitation’. Hence, it is not sufficiently clear in advance what abuses in labour situations 
can be qualified as exploitation within the meaning of THB. The aim of this paper is to 
contribute to a further clarification of the term exploitation. 
 
Serious offence 
Trafficking in human beings is a serious offence. The Explanatory Memorandum states that 
Article 273f deals with excesses and forms of modern slavery. The fact that the provision is 
not intended for less serious offences can be deduced from its inclusion under Title XVIII of 
the Criminal Code: Offences against personal freedom, immediately preceding the provision 
on slave trade, as well as from the heavy penalty of up to maximum six years imprisonment 
for ‘plain’ trafficking in human beings, rising to fifteen years under aggravating 
circumstances. 
The wording in various subsections of Article 273f paragraph 1, however, gives a potentially 
considerable range to the article. As a result, from a purely linguistic point of view, behaviour 
of various grades of severity can be brought within the scope of the provision. Subsections 4 
and 6 in particular expand the scope. For example, according to paragraph 1 sub 4, THB 
could already be said to occur when a person ‘induces’ another person, by means of 
‘deception’, to make himself available for performing work or services. Subsection 6 places 
the bar even lower: for example, the informed consumer buying a product produced 
elsewhere in the world under exploitative conditions, may be guilty of the offence of THB. 
An informed buyer of a cheap, hand-knotted Persian rug or a delicious chocolate bar 
manufactured from cocoa harvested by children may be a profiteer and a trafficker within the 
meaning of this subsection. 
 
Teleological approach 
Although the bar for applying Article 273f of the Criminal Code is thus set very low if a 
literal interpretation is taken, in view of the underlying convention and the context of 
organised crime in which THB is placed nationally and internationally, the provision and the 
penalty that the offence carries should only be used for excesses. Not every abuse in relation 
to work or services should be categorised as THB. Limiting the scope of application is 
justified from a teleological approach in combination with the human rights perspective. In 
terms of legislative history, the importance of protecting fundamental human rights is 
paramount to the interpretation of Article 273f. For the non-exhaustive account of 
exploitation in paragraph 2 is largely11 based on Article 3(a) of the Palermo Protocol and 
Article 1 paragraph 1 sub c of the EU Framework Decision, which in turn derive terms from 
inter alia Article 4 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) of 4 November 1950. The latter article obliges Contracting 
States to provide effective protection against slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory 
labour and refers to the prohibition on slave trade, slavery and bondage in Article 4 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (10 December 1948). Furthermore, both the 
international documents which underlie the amendment of the Dutch trafficking provision 
state that the protection of human rights is central in combating THB. A teleological 

                                                 
9 Contrary to the text of the Palermo Protocol, Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code qualifies the 
forced removal of organs not as exploitation, but as a separate aim of THB.

11 It does not, however, correspond exactly with the definition in the Palermo Protocol or the 
Framework Decision which also differ on some details.

interpretation (true to source) therefore leads to the conclusion that the protection of the 
human rights of individual victims must play a crucial role in combating THB. It is in fact the 
human rights approach that sets the limits to the scope of the definition of THB; labour 
situations deemed socially undesirable only then constitute exploitation within the meaning of 
the trafficking provision if they cause a violation of fundamental rights, such as human 
dignity, physical integrity or personal freedom of the individual concerned. Against 
reprehensible circumstances that do not constitute exploitation in this sense other sanctions 
under criminal labour or administrative labour must be used. In that case, the protection of the 
interests harmed does not justify the application of the severe THB article. 
 
The concept of exploitation in Article 273f of the Dutch criminal code 
Exploitation is the central element in the crime of THB. After all, according to the 
Explanatory Memorandum, ‘trafficking in human beings is (aimed at) exploitation.’ Yet, 
other than a non-exhaustive summary of practices that exploitation at least comprises 
(paragraph 2), neither Article 273f nor the Explanatory Memorandum contains a description 
of what exploitation should be taken to mean in concrete terms. Because of the potentially 
broad applicability of the provision on the one hand and the (international) context in which 
THB is discussed on the other hand, further specification of this term is needed. 
Exploitation is commonly12 described as ‘the attempt to obtain as much gain as possible’, ‘to 
abuse’ and, specifically in relation to a person, ‘to put [a person] to work under unfavourable 
conditions in order to gain as much profit as possible’. This can be summarised as excessively 
taking advantage of another person. 
Within the meaning of the THB article, exploitation must be related to a situation of work or 
services. As argued, there must also be an excess (i.e. a violation of fundamental human 
rights). Article 273f paragraph 2 gives a non-exhaustive summary of what such exploitation 
can be taken to mean: exploitation of another in prostitution, other forms of sexual 
exploitation, forced or compulsory labour or services, slavery and practices comparable to 
slavery or servitude. As stated, this is listing situations that the legislator typifies as 
exploitation, rather than providing a clearly defined, substantial criterion. 
In relation to the sex industry, the legislator and the Supreme Court identify a situation of 
exploitation when the person involved is in a situation inferior to the circumstances in which 
an articulate prostitute would normally operate in the Netherlands.13 Due to the nature of the 
work, forced work in the sex industry quickly becomes exploitation, since the physical 
integrity is by definition at stake. The same applies to the forced removal of organs. For 
exploitation in other sectors than the sex industry, a similar criterion (the situation in which an 
articulate worker normally operates) may be useful as a starting or reference point, but a more 
stringent standard is nevertheless more appropriate. In these cases it is usually not the nature 
of the work that is decisive in relation to the key question whether fundamental human rights 
are being violated when the (labour) conditions deviate from the normal situation. The 
seriousness of the deviating circumstances, the route leading towards them and the effect on 
the person concerned are then above all the factors determining whether or not exploitation is 
involved. After all, not every circumstance that is unacceptable to an articulate Dutch worker 
will immediately constitute a violation of human rights. 
What precisely the lower limit should be for other forms of exploitation is unclear. An 
unambiguous description of an excess in the area of work or services cannot be given.

Whether or not a situation is excessive must be assessed on a case by case basis. The 
determining factor at any rate is the (inherent) violation of fundamental human rights. In 
order for a situation to be categorised as excessive, either at least one obvious excess must be 
evident, such as living in the workplace under extremely poor conditions (e.g. the obligation 
to rent only a chair that one can sleep on in shifts), debt bondage or multiple dependency 
tying the victim to the person putting him/her to work, or an accumulation of less serious 
abuses.14 In the latter case, where elements are ‘stacked up’,15 each of the individual abuses 
could perhaps be dealt with under employment law, but the excess lies in the combination and 
accumulation of such elements. Factors such as the seriousness, the duration, the extent and 
the economic benefit gained by the perpetrator also play a role here. 
The single or composite excess must in principle be viewed objectively; circumstances are 
excessive if they are unacceptable in Dutch society and legal order, i.e. according to the 
prevailing standards in the Netherlands. In objectifying this, fundamental human rights once 
again play a central role. To qualify a situation as exploitation, it is therefore not crucial 
whether the victim considers himself or herself to be exploited. However, the subjective 
perception of the victim can play a role when answering the question to what extent he or she 
could have escaped from the exploitative situation (see below). 
 
Exploitation within the meaning of THB 
When (the prupose of) exploitation is coupled with the use of a means of coercion, this 
constitutes trafficking in human beings within the meaning of Article 273a of the Criminal 
Code. The concept of exploitation must therefore be interpreted/understood separately from 
the demonstration of coercion. This follows inter alia from the fact that in the case of 
trafficking in minors no coercion is required, while (the purpose of) exploitation is (paragraph 
1 sub 2). If the use of coercion were to constitute an element of exploitation, it would still 
implicitly be a requirement for trafficking in minors. With regard to adults, even a double 
requirement of coercion would then be introduced, as subsection 1 contains the condition of 
both (the purpose of) exploitation and the use of coercion. This cannot be the objective. 
Exploitation does, however, imply a certain degree of involuntariness on the part of the 
person being exploited.16 This involuntariness lies in the inability to escape from the 
exploitative situation.17 In the case of measures that directly restrict a victim’s physical 
freedom (e.g. confinement or being kept under guard), escape is actually impossible. If, 
however, the victim is kept within the grasp of his or her exploiter by other means, escape 
may be possible practically speaking, but the subjective judgement of the victim that he/she 
cannot escape can form an obstacle after all. The facts and circumstances do however have to 
demonstrate that the victim could reasonably believe that he or she was not able to escape 
from the situation on his or her own. This could be due, for instance, to the (perceived) 
consequences of an escape or the actual living or working conditions of the victim. For 
example, the lack of freedom could result from a relationship of debt towards the person 

                                                 
14 One could think of underpayment, irregular payment, long working hours, obligation to work under a 
different identity, confiscation of one’s passport, the threat of dismissal if the activities demanded are 
not carried out, etc. 
15 In police circles this term is used to describe the method of linking up signals that together, though 
not necessarily each individually, (may) indicate the existence of an exploitative situation. 
16 It may be conceivable that a person voluntarily allows himself or herself to be exploited, but this 
cannot be considered the normal pattern. This is probably what the Explanatory Memorandum means 
with the comment “Typical of exploitation is the existence of coercion in the broadest sense, or abuse.” 
17 In addition, there is the use of one of the means of coercion, as a result of which a person finds 
himself/herself in an exploitative situation. That use of coercion can also prevent the exploited person 
from escaping from the situation.

providing the employment or a third party, the cultural context, the person being a minor or a 
combination of such factors. For this assessment, it is important to examine the body of facts 
in their totality. 
Exploitation within the meaning of THB is therefore about gross abuses, whereby the victim’s 
fundamental human rights are violated and he/she is or reasonably believes himself/herself to 
be seriously restricted in his/her freedom to escape from this situation. 
 
ECHR and the Siliadin case 
Whereas the wording of the trafficking provision and the Explanatory Memorandum provide 
few reference points for the interpretation of the term ‘exploitation’ or ‘other forms of 
exploitation’, the Dutch courts may, in their law-forming task to arrive at a clearly defined, 
distinguishing criterion, take note of the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights of 26 
July 2005 in the case Siliadin versus France.18 This is an interesting ruling because in it the 
Court observes for the first time a violation of Article 4 of the ECHR, in a case that is 
indisputably about ‘another form of exploitation’ within the meaning of THB, namely 
domestic slavery. 
The ruling is unequivocal in that Contracting States have a positive obligation to protect their 
citizens concretely and effectively against violations of Article 4 of the ECHR, also in the 
relationships between citizens themselves (horizontal enforcement). The state is liable if it 
offers insufficient safeguards against such a violation, either in legislation or in its 
implementation. This positive obligation demands that each act that serves to hold a person in 
one of the situations referred to in Article 4 of the ECHR be punishable and – de facto – 
effectively repressed. France had not fulfilled this obligation in the case of the Togolese 
minor Siliadin, who was living and working illegally in France. The conditions and 
circumstances under which she lived with family B and was required to carry out household 
work led, in the Court’s view, to a state of servitude, against which France had offered 
insufficient protection by failing to pursue an effective prosecution of the couple B.19 
In relation to a better understanding of Article 273f of the Dutch Criminal Code, this ruling is 
particularly important because the European Court of Human Rights makes explicit the order 
among the practices prohibited under Article 4 of the ECHR, and in doing so weighs the 
particular circumstances of the case. As far as the interpretation of compulsory labour is 
concerned, for example, the Court follows the definition contained in Article 2 of the ILO 
Convention concerning Forced Labour.20 In this convention, forced or compulsory labour or 
services is understood to mean all work or services exacted from any person under the 
menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself/herself available 
voluntarily. In Siliadin versus France, the Court holds that the menace of any penalty already 
exists when employers stimulated the fear of a minor, unaccompanied, illegal worker of being 
caught by the police. Thus, the menace of a penalty does not need to exist in a literal sense 
(ground 118). 
The Court subsequently compares forced or compulsory labour or service with servitude. The 
latter presupposes a more severe denial of personal freedom. Although it does not constitute 
                                                 
18 Case of Siliadin V. France, ECHR 26 July 2005, application no. 73316/01. A note to this ruling by 
R.A. Lawson was published in JV 2005/425 (FORUM). 
19 At the time of the offences (1994-1998) France did not have a provision in its Criminal Code that 
made THB as such a punishable offence. The couple B was prosecuted for the violation of two criminal 
provisions about obtaining unpaid work from a person, by abusing his/her vulnerability and 
dependence, and subjecting a person, by abusing his/her vulnerability and dependence, to working and 
living conditions in violation of human dignity.

force on 1 May 1932.

any claim of ownership, servitude is equivalent to slavery in terms of its gravity. It refers, 
according to the Court in the Siliadin case, to the situation in which a person not only has to 
carry out work or provide services, but is also forced to live in the house or on the property of 
his/her ‘holder’ and is unable to change the situation. As is evident from the Court’s 
judgement, this is also the case when a person in a vulnerable position is required to work 
seven days a week without pay, lives in poor accommodation at the workplace and has little 
freedom of movement. 
Due to the detailed examination of the particulars of a concrete case in relation to the various 
elements of Article 4 of the ECHR, the Siliadin ruling can serve as a guideline for the Dutch 
courts which will undoubtedly have to deal with gross abuses in other sectors than the sex 
industry within the foreseeable future, and will therefore mark out further the boundaries of 
the unknown territory of ‘other exploitation’.21 
 
Conclusion 
The ‘lex certa’ principle states that the law must be formulated in such accurate terms that one 
can establish beforehand what judicial consequences certain acts will have. The question 
arises whether the new THB provision in the Criminal Code can indeed stand up to the test of 
the ‘lex certa’ criterion. Based on case law, the area of THB within the meaning of 
exploitation in the sex industry has been further clarified over the years. However, the penalty 
provision for the new category of ‘other exploitation’ does pose considerable questions for 
those applying the law. The Explanatory Memorandum explicitly states that the government 
prefers to wait and see how the trafficking provision will be applied in practice, therefore 
leaving it to the courts on this point. This is risky, also in the light of the European Court of 
Human Rights’ ruling in the Siliadin case, since it can mean that the criminal code and its 
implementation do not de facto provide a victim with the protection prescribed in the ECHR. 
 
We have argued that in relation to other sectors than the sex industry, the bar must not be set 
too low when defining THB within the meaning of Article 273f of the Criminal Code. The 
fact that only excessive (employment) situations should be qualified as exploitation, however, 
does not alter the fact that the police and judicial authorities, but also other partners involved 
in identifying and combating THB, are required to respond to even small indications of 
potential exploitation. After all, there may well be more to a particular situation than first 
meets the eye. A proper way of dealing with the problem therefore demands on the one hand 
a clear penalization that is workable in practice, and on the other hand that every relevant lead 
be examined and lead to prosecution if possible.22 Only in this way can we realise the ideal 
that in combating THB, the main thing is the protection of (possible) victims. 
 
 

                                                 
21 Since publication of the original version of this article, the first verdict in a case of THB for other 
forms of exploitation in the Netherlands was given on 21 November 2006. Five suspects were 
convicted for forming a criminal organisation to illegally produce hemp, but they were acquitted on the 
charge of THB. Although the court found that they had, by misuse of a position of vulnerability, put to 
work undocumented Bulgarian migrants in a criminal setting, it ruled that the labour situation did not 
constitute exploitation. Important factors for the court were the absence of multiple dependency of the 
workers on the suspects, the fact that the work was occasional and the underpayment not excessive. 
22 In this sense too, the Instructions for THB of the Board of Procurators General dated 6 March 2006 
entered into force on 1 April 2006.
