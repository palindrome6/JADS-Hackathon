  Foreword

“The role of statistics is not so much to provide information as to indicate what information one should 
be seeking”. This apposite remark indicates the importance of statistics and data – information that is 
often used to bolster political or other opinions or as a foundation for radical policy measures.

This study is about data, specifically about statistics relating to human trafficking in the Netherlands. The 
aim of the study is to reveal what the statistics can tell us about human trafficking in the Netherlands. 
But it also has another purpose: to map the ‘statistical landscape’ on human trafficking. What figures 
are in circulation and on what sources are they based?

There are many different statistics about human trafficking in circulation. The desire to estimate the 
scale of the phenomenon is widely shared, which is understandable since human trafficking is a complex 
offence which, although increasingly visible in practice, is nevertheless still often difficult to see. In ad-
dition to this complexity, there are the statistics, which convey a sense of robustness and certainty. They 
suggest that we have a clear view of a complex problem like human trafficking, so it is not surprising 
that they are often used.

But the figures for human trafficking that have been in circulation in the past have not all been equally 
reliable. Furthermore, some data are not always interpreted accurately, but nevertheless start to lead a 
life of their own in the literature and the media. Statistics then do the opposite of what they are intended 
to do, which is to provide reliable information. Accordingly, they can create the possibility that positions 
and policies will be based on defective or incomplete information.

The key to my mandate is to identify the nature and scale of human trafficking in the Netherlands. In 
this study, I have tried to identify as accurately as possible, from various sources, what quantitative data 
are currently available on human trafficking in the Netherlands. The report covers a range of subjects: 
the number of (possible) victims of human trafficking registered in the Netherlands, their characteris-
tics and the sectors in which they are believed to be exploited, as well as how many suspects have been 
prosecuted over the years and what their backgrounds are. This report also analyses the investigations 
of human trafficking carried out in 2009 and the types of suspects involved.

Does this study then show the full reality of human trafficking in the Netherlands? I certainly do not 
suggest that it does. By definition, quantitative research has its limitations. Many factors can influence 
the figures, whether they show an increase or a decrease. Different agencies might use different defini-
tions, for example, so that one agency might regard an offence as human trafficking and register it as

10

such, while another might not. Furthermore, the priority that various agencies have assigned to human 
trafficking in recent years is likely to have had an impact on the growth in the number of registered cases 
and in the number of victims and suspects. I greatly welcome this development, but it must not lead to 
the conclusion that human trafficking is increasing in the Netherlands. We are seeing more human traf-
ficking. And seeing it, continuing to look for it, remains a constant priority.

Because how much do we not see? The statistics do not always provide the answer to that question. A 
Norwegian public prosecutor recently confided to me that what counts when interviewing human traf-
ficking victims is often not what they say, but what they don’t say. I see an analogy in this with this study. 
Statistics show us part of the reality; the part where human trafficking has surfaced, victims have been 
provided with shelter and suspects have been arrested. That is the visible human trafficking. But what is 
hidden from us? What do the statistics not tell us? That aspect of quantitative research is just as interest-
ing. It makes me realise the importance of always placing statistics in perspective, of studying them in 
the context of various developments. It is for that reason that this study also reviews attempts that have 
been made to gain an impression of the so-called ‘dark number’, the unregistered or unknown human 
trafficking that exists but is not seen.

Obviously, quantitative research is complex and always unassuming. Only carefully produced data have 
genuine added value. They are not only informative but are of actual use to stakeholders: they indicate 
the “information one should be seeking”. Painstakingly compiled statistics, in short, are the essential 
subsoil on which good policies can grow.

I am grateful to many individuals and agencies for their help in carrying out this study. It would have 
been impossible to produce this report without the assistance of the institutions that shared their data 
and other information with us: first and foremost, our regular partners, the Coordination Centre for 
Human Trafficking (CoMensha), the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) and the Ministry of 
Security and Justice’s Research and Documentation Centre (WODC). I am also grateful for the assistance 
those agencies provided to the Bureau of the National Rapporteur for its study of police investigations in 
this report. I am particularly grateful to the students of the detective training course at the Police Acad-
emy, and I also wish to thank Stichting M., the independent hotline for reporting crime anonymously.

I would especially like to thank the staff, former staff and interns who made a huge contribution to the 
production of this study.

National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children 



1 Introduction

Human trafficking usually has a hidden face. Naturally, offenders want to conceal their activities, but 
many victims are also afraid to come forward. This report shows, for example, that victims are exploited 
for an average of a year before the police discover what is happening, if they discover it at all. Far longer 
periods of exploitation are also possible:

Eight years of exploitation
In 2000, a women from the city of Sliven in Bulgaria was brought to Groningen. She was involved 
in a relationship with a man four years older than her (a pig farmer in Bulgaria) who feigned to be 
in a loving relationship with her, causing her to believe that her future was secure. After some time, 
there was no more question of love. The woman had to work long hours (more than eight hours 
a day) as a prostitute. She was constantly controlled by her so-called lover, who confiscated the 
money she earned and threatened not only her, but also her family, with violence. She was forced 
to work for more than eight years in window prostitution in Groningen before she dared to tell 
her story.1

The best way of tackling a hidden problem is to bring it out in the open, make it visible. This requires 
the collection and analysis of quantitative data to outline the contours of the problem and expose bot-
tlenecks in attempts to combat it. For example, it was found earlier that the number of acquittals in 
human trafficking cases was high,2 which suggested that it is difficult to secure a conviction in these 
cases. Possible reasons for this were investigated in the study of the case law of human trafficking over 
the last three years.3

This report gathers together all of the statistics about human trafficking in the Netherlands, but the total 
scale of the problem remains unknown. Figure 1.1 summarises the content of this report and illustrates 
the visible and invisible human trafficking in the Netherlands.

The triangle shows the total scale of human trafficking. The part we know about is shown in light blue 
and the unknown part is in dark blue. That unknown part is the subject of Chapter 2. The so-called ‘dark 
number’ can only be estimated since, by definition, there are no data on it. What are the current esti-

mates and how reliable are they? The extent of the human trafficking that we know about is the subject 
of Chapters 3 to 7: what records do the relevant agencies keep on human trafficking and what do those 
records tell us about human trafficking?

Figure 1.1 The scale of human trafficking in the Netherlands (2011)

The statistics record registered human trafficking: in 2011, there were 1,222 possible victims reported to the 
Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha), and 255 suspects were identified by the Public 
Prosecution Service (PPS). But this is not the entire reality. First, there is a dark number, the size of which is 
unknown: these are all human trafficking situations that no agency knows about. Second, people could 
also be registered as a victim or an offender, although they are not: the false positives. The number of human 
trafficking situations known to agencies such as CoMensha and the PPS depends mainly on developments 
that are separate from the actual scale of human trafficking, such as more police investigations, which 
should produce more suspects. Greater public attention could also lead to more human trafficking situa-
tions being identified. Such changes would move the dotted line in Figure 1.1 downwards, making a larger 
part of the actual human trafficking visible.

Section A: The dark number

Two things are needed to illuminate the full scale of human trafficking. First, the invisible part must be 
estimated as carefully as possible, so that relevant agencies know what they are looking for. The problem 
is not that there are no estimates, but that they are not accurate and reliable. Chapter 2 discusses exist-
ing estimates of human trafficking in the Netherlands and elsewhere and makes a number of important 
suggestions for improving these estimates.

Section B: Registered human trafficking

The second thing that is needed follows from the important finding in Chapter 2 that to estimate the 
scale of the invisible human trafficking, it is necessary to know as much as possible about the human 
trafficking that is visible. The full nature and scale of what we know must be identified – not only for the 
purpose of making estimates but also because registered cases are the primary basis for formulating and 
implementing policy. The PPS, for example, obviously only deals with cases that are known to the police. 
Do they always handle them correctly? Statistics can help us answer this question.

Chapters 3 and 4 contain information about victims. Chapter 3 relates to visible (possible) victims. In 
principle, CoMensha registers every possible victim of human trafficking. Chapter 4 presents data on 
victims who were granted temporary residence on the grounds of the B9 regulation.4 Chapters 5 and 6 
provide information about suspects and offenders: Chapter 5 analyses all 55 completed police investi-
gations in 2009, while Chapter 6 discusses the prosecution and trial of traffickers in the Netherlands. 
Because of the specific focus on the Netherlands, chapters 3 to 6 are only summaries of the information 
that can be found in the Dutch report Mensenhandel in en uit beeld.5 

Since human trafficking is not bound by national borders – both offenders and victims often move 
through different countries – there is considerable international interest in generating comparable data. 
Chapter 7 reviews some initiatives, mainly at European level, that have already been taken or are still 
underway in this area, which also illustrate the importance of international cooperation. 

National rapporteurs
Pursuant to the EU Directive on Human Trafficking, EU member states are required to appoint a na-
tional rapporteur or a similar mechanism to monitor and report on actions taken to combat human 
trafficking.6 Almost all the EU member states have now established mechanisms to perform this 
task, usually assigned to a ministry. Figure 7.1 illustrates the many operational sources of relevant 
data that can exist at national level. The data relating to offenders are generally available or made 
accessible for the monitoring mechanisms in a ministry without any problem. It is different with 
data on victims, which is generally sensitive. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are often 
reluctant to share data with government agencies. Protecting the victim’s privacy is an important 
factor in this, as is uncertainty about the security of the information that is provided.7 The Neth-
erlands does not have that problem because of the independent position enjoyed by the National

information, see National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2009, Chapter 5.

take the necessary measures to establish national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms. The tasks of such mechanisms 
shall include the carrying out of assessments of trends in trafficking in human beings, the measuring of results of anti-
trafficking actions, including the gathering of statistics in close cooperation with relevant civil society organisations active 
in this field, and reporting.’.

Rapporteur,8 which guarantees the protection of sensitive data on victims, but also about suspects 
and perpetrators. A rapporteur or similar mechanism that does not enjoy that independence might 
not have access to sufficient data, which could impair the process of analysis and, by extension, 
the development of effective policy.

Section C: Conclusions and recommendations

Using statistics, this report shines a spotlight on the problem of human trafficking. The data we have 
on the visible and invisible faces of human trafficking outline the contours of the problem itself, and 
of the policies that are pursued. Section C contains the most important findings from this report and 
presents a lists of recommendations.

The key message of this report is:

To tackle human trafficking effectively, it must be made visible. Human trafficking that is hidden 
must be revealed – and once revealed, it must be better registered.

8 Inherent to this independence is the fact that no coordinating or executive tasks have been delegated 
to the National Rapporteur. See also National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2008, §1.2 
and §2.1.

  Chapter 2 Estimates of the scale of human trafficking





2 Estimates of the scale of human trafficking 

2.1 Introduction 

Many of the estimates of the scale of human trafficking have been based on false or unfounded as-
sumptions and are consequently unreliable. Paradoxically, these estimates are often repeatedly used and 
increasingly accepted as correct,1 although they are often also (correctly) regarded as unreliable, which 
could be a pretext to produce new estimates. With many different estimates available (partly because of 
the different definitions that are used), there is a tendency to ‘choose’ the estimate that suits one best, 
which could differ from one agency to another.

These factors have led to two dominant approaches to the use of estimates of human trafficking: (1) in 
the absence of anything better, the estimate that suits one best is cited or (2) no estimate is cited because 
all are considered unreliable and it is believed to be impossible to make reliable estimates. Neither op-
tion is desirable, since policies based on an unreliable estimate or based on no estimate at all are, in 
fact, equally ineffectual. What is needed therefore is an effort to produce reliable estimates on which 
there is consensus.2

With crime, the sample population is often unknown because offenders keep their criminal activities 
hidden. For this reason, criminal offences are not all identified, meaning that registration is incomplete 
and an unknown part of the population remains hidden.3 This hidden part of the population is known 
as the dark number. Not every form of crime is hidden to the same extent. Victimless crimes or crimes 
whose victims are not readily inclined to report them tend to be less well documented (have a larger 
dark number) than offences whose victims often or almost always inform the police. Victims of human 
trafficking belong to the first, less visible, group, because they are often unwilling or afraid to report 

1 One explanation for this is the lack of information needed to interpret the phenomenon of human 
trafficking (in order to formulate anti-human trafficking policies, for example) in combination with 
the lack of reliable estimates.

2 Broadly speaking, this is the message of a paper by Gould for the Second Annual Interdisciplinary 
Conference on Human Trafficking 2010, in which she called for existing estimates of human trafficking 
to be reviewed critically, with a view to developing new and better estimates, with the ultimate aim of 
producing reasonably reliable estimates on which there is substantial consensus.

offences4 or they do not realise that they are victims.5 They are only discovered if they are identified by 
third parties (the police, for example), and these victims frequently deny their identification as victims. 
For these reasons, standard methods of estimation cannot be used to estimate the population of victims6 
of human trafficking so other methods are needed.7

The scale of human trafficking is equal to the scale of registered – known – human trafficking minus 
the false positives (human trafficking that is registered as such but is not in reality human trafficking) 
plus the dark number (of unregistered/unknown human trafficking, which includes the false negatives 
(human trafficking that is known but is not recognised or registered as such). In short, it is the ag-
gregate of the ‘visible’ and the ‘invisible’ human trafficking.

In this chapter, we discuss the most recent estimates of the number of victims of sexual exploitation 
(§2.2) and of other forms of exploitation (§2.3) in the Netherlands. §2.4 is devoted to the most recent 
international estimate of forced labour (sexual and other forms of exploitation)8 by the International 
Labour Organization (ILO). These estimates are reviewed critically with a view to providing suggestions 
for developing more reliable estimates. The chapter concludes with a number of suggestions for further 
steps that can be taken in the process of criticism and improvement (§2.4.3).

It is important to reiterate that the purpose of criticising the estimates is to initiate improvements. It is 
not the intention of the criticism to discourage attempts to produce estimates. After all, without esti-
mates to criticise, no progress can be made. On the other hand, the presentation and use of estimates 
as true or reliable should be discouraged until there is some degree of consensus that they possess an 
acceptable level of reliability. Everyone is invited to advance the proposed process by raising further criti-
cisms of issues that might have been missed and/or qualifying the criticisms we have made. Obviously, 

4 For example, because of fear, shame or a sense of guilt. For non-Dutch victims, other factors might be 
problems with the language and/or ignorance of where to go for help in the Netherlands. For victims 
living illegally in the Netherlands, there is the additional fear of the police because they are worried 
about being deported from the country. Sometimes, victims have also incurred debts to the human 
trafficker (fictitious or otherwise) that they must (or feel they must) repay. Victims might also feel 
obligated to send money back regularly to their family (National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human 
Beings 2002, §4.5; National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2004, §3.6).

5 For example, victims who feel they are in love with their exploiter (National Rapporteur on Trafficking 
in Human Beings 2004, §3.2.2) or non-Dutch victims who prefer the situation of exploitation in the 
Netherlands to the situation in their own country (National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 
2007, §3.2.1).

6 Estimates of the scale of human trafficking almost always focus on the number of victims rather 
than the number of offenders or situations, aspects that are certainly at least as important. In fact, 
the number of offender and human trafficking situations could also be estimated on the basis of a 
reliable estimate of the number of victims, based on knowledge of the average number of victims per 
offender and the overlap of victims among offenders, as well as knowledge of the average number of 
victims involved in a human trafficking situation and the overlap of victims among situations.

this is a multidisciplinary process that requires the involvement of statisticians. The fact that it might 
be a never-ending process does not detract from its importance. After all, it is a process that will lead 
to steadily more reliable estimates and, by extension, steadily more effective efforts to combat human 
trafficking.

2.2 A national estimate of victims of sexual exploitation

The Crime Projection Analysis (CBA) of sexual exploitation in 2012 produced an estimate of the total 
number of actual victims of human trafficking with respect to sexual exploitation in the Netherlands.9 
In this section, we note some reservations about both the methods of calculation used (§2.2.1) and the 
assumptions (§2.2.2 and §2.2.3) on which the estimate was based. In view of those reservations, the 
estimate cannot be regarded as in any way reliable (§2.2.4). It does, however, contribute to the process 
of criticism and improvement that could ultimately lead to a reasonably reliable national estimate.

2.2.1 Reservations about the method of calculation 
In the CBA, the method of calculation used to estimate the number of victims of human trafficking invol-
ving sexual exploitation in 2010 started with the victims of sexual exploitation registered by the Coordi-
nation Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha) in 2010 (N: 797, according to the CBA). The researchers 
then identified the percentage of the total number of notifications that were made to CoMensha by the 
police in 2010 (69%). This would mean that the police reported roughly 549 victims of sexual exploitation 
to CoMensha in 2010, which, according to the CBA, represented 5% of the total number of victims (see as-
sumption 1 below). According to this calculation, CoMensha was aware of 7.3% of all victims in 2010. The 
estimate of the total number of victims of sexual exploitation, which was based on this assumption, then 
comes to roughly 10,917 in 2010. We have a number of reservations about this method of calculation.

(1) The figure of 69% for the share of reports made to CoMensha by the police makes no distinction 
between victims of sexual exploitation and victims of other forms of exploitation. The CBA used this per-
centage to estimate the number of victims of sexual exploitation, but, as it was the combined percentage 
of victims of both sexual and other forms of exploitation, it should not have been used. (2) The figure of 
69% is based on the total number of notifications made to CoMensha, which is not the same as the total 
number of victims. Some victims are notified to CoMensha by different agencies, so the percentage used 
was measured at the wrong level. (3) In addition, the notifications from the aliens police were mistakenly 
omitted from the figure of 69% for the percentage of reports made by the police. (4) It is also unclear why 
the 5% of victims that the police reportedly knew about (see assumption 1 below) was changed to 7.3% 
known to CoMensha, before then postulating the total. This unnecessary intermediate step makes the 
final estimate even less accurate.10 (5) While the authors of the CBA wanted to produce findings about 
the number of victims in 2010, they failed to take account of the fact that the victims who are reported 
to CoMensha in a particular year were not necessarily victims in that year. In addition, the period dur-

9 KLPD-DNR (2012, pp. 37-43).
10 After all, if the 549 victims that were notified to the Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking 

(CoMensha) by the police (according to the CBA) are regarded as 5%, the total number of victims would 
come to 10,980 rather than 10,917 (based on 549 victims: 5%, leading to 797 victims: 7.3%, leading to 
10,917 victims: 100%).

ing which a person is a victim of human trafficking frequently transcends a particular year. (6) There is 
also no reliability interval in the estimate in the CBA, as is usual when making estimates. A reliability 
interval indicates how great the probability is that the actual number of victims corresponds with the 
estimated number. The estimated number is therefore always given as a range. (7) Finally, the method 
of calculation used in the CBA fails to take account of false positives, in other words, persons who have 
been incorrectly registered as victims. Since the victims registered with CoMensha are possible victims and 
therefore not all identified victims, the proportion of false positives might be significant and should have 
been deducted from the registered number to produce a better estimate of the actual number. The CBA 
does, in fact, refer to an estimate of the number of possible victims and therefore does not imply that the 
estimate relates to the actual number of victims.

If the method of calculation adopted in the CBA is corrected for the first four of these reservations, the 
number of victims of sexual exploitation in the Netherlands would have increased as follows in the last 
three years.11

In 2009, 423 victims of sexual exploitation were reported to CoMensha, of whom 304 by the police 
(including the aliens police), among others.12 The total estimated number would therefore be (304: 
5%) 6,080 victims of sexual exploitation in the Netherlands in that year.13

In 2010, 749 victims of sexual exploitation were reported to CoMensha, of whom 598 by the police 
(including the aliens police), among others. The total estimated number would therefore be (598: 
5%) 11,960 victims of sexual exploitation in the Netherlands in that year.14

In 2011, 781 victims of sexual exploitation were reported to CoMensha, of whom 654 by the police 
(including the aliens police), among others. The total estimated number would therefore be (654: 
5%) 13,080 victims of sexual exploitation in the Netherlands in that year.15

11 The data from CoMensha are based on the CoMensha registration database that are produced for the 
Bureau of the National Rapporteur. See Chapter 3. The figures for 2010 differ slightly from the figures 
that were used by the CBA, which correspond with the figures in CoMensha’s annual reports. The data 
presented here are the correct figures, however.

12 It is assumed that ‘the police’ refers to all divisions of the police and not to every investigative service, 
such as agencies like the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar) and the former Social Intelligence 
and Investigation Service (SIOD) (which is now part of the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs 
and Employment). Notifications from these agencies are therefore also not included.

13 CoMensha would have been aware of roughly 7.0% of the total number of  victims of  sexual 
exploitation in 2009.

14 CoMensha would have been aware of roughly 6.3% of the total number of victims of sexual exploitation 
in 2010.

15 CoMensha would have been aware of roughly 6.0% of the total number of victims of sexual exploitation 
in 2011.



Estimates of the scale of human trafficking
21

The number, according to the CBA, would therefore have more than doubled in three years (from 6,080 
to 13,080).16 It is highly unlikely that the number did actually double. This prompts a critical review of 
the two assumptions on which the CBA based its estimate.

2.2.2 Reservations about assumption 1

Assumption 1: The police are aware of 5% of the victims of human trafficking (according to the CBA)

(1) It was assumed that the portion of the hidden crime that the police are aware of is constant (at 5%). 
That is incorrect for the offence of human trafficking in the Netherlands, in any case, since it would mean 
that a more effective effort to combat human trafficking (reflected, among other things, in the identifica-
tion of more victims) would also lead to more actual victims of human trafficking (because the steadily 
increasing number of victims that the police are aware of would always represent 5%). A more logical 
explanation for the increase in the number of victims that the police are aware of is, therefore, a decline 
in the dark number, due, among other things, to the growing public attention to human trafficking,17 
the higher priority and increased capacity assigned to the offence by the investigative agencies and the 
Public Prosecution Service (PPS),18 more consistent reporting to and more complete registration by the 
relevant authorities,19 expansion of legal definitions20 and increasing knowledge about the nature of 
human trafficking (due in part to greater experience).21 Trends in these factors are therefore incorrectly 
attributed to developments with respect to the scale of human trafficking.22

16 And at the same time, the percentage of victims notified to CoMensha would decline every year, from 
7% to 6% in three years (see the three preceding footnotes).

17 The greater the attention, the more likely members of the public are to identify probable misconduct 
and report it directly to the police or indirectly via Stichting M. (the hotline for reporting crime 
anonymously).

18 The principle of ‘the more you look, the more you find’.
19 The greater the investment in consistency of reporting and completeness of registration, the more 

known incidents will also be registered as such. Naturally, the ultimate aim is for the number of known 
cases to be the same as the number of registered cases (perfect reporting and registration).

20 For example, the expansion of the legal definition of human trafficking from exclusively sexual 
exploitation to also include exploitation in other economic sectors and exploitation for the purpose 
of the removal of organs in 2005.

21 For example, knowledge about how to identify victims, where they can be found (in which sectors), 
how offenders operate and what facilitators they use, etc.

22 In principle, the factors seem to be separate from human trafficking as it actually occurs, but it is 
plausible that there is a certain degree of interaction between efforts to combat human trafficking and 
the phenomenon itself. For example, a more effective approach can have a deterrent effect (human 
trafficking is less attractive for potential offenders because of the increased risk of getting caught). 
However, it is an illusion to expect that this will deter all offenders to the same extent. Some will be 
able to adapt (change their modus operandi) and so reduce the chance of being caught. This could 
cause a waterbed effect, so that a larger part of the actual human trafficking will remain out of sight of 
the police (the dark number will increase again).



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
22

(2) There are also two uncertainties with regard to assumption 1 that were not considered in the CBA. 
Because there are no references to sources, it is impossible to answer the following questions:

* What precisely is meant by ‘5% of crime’? Is this 5% of the offenders, of the victims or of the offences 
committed (human trafficking situations)? After all, a single unique offender creates one or more victims 
during one or more offences. At the same time, one and the same person might be a victim of one or 
more offenders in one or more offences. If the 5% that the police are aware of is a representative sample 
of the actual total, the fact that the 5% might not be based on the number of victims but, for example, 
on the number of offences, should not have any consequences for the ultimate estimate of the number 
of victims. However, it is unlikely to be a representative sample. Consequently, an estimate of the total 
number of victims based on 5% of the offences committed, for example, is incorrect. The following 
example illustrates this:

Suppose that in one year 600 human trafficking offences are committed in the Netherlands, with a 
total of 1,380 victims (in other words, an average of 2.3 victims per offence). The police are theoreti-
cally aware of 5% of these offences, which represents 30 human trafficking offences. If the sample 
is not representative, it is unlikely that these 30 offences that are known to the police will also 
involve an average of 2.3 – and therefore a total of 69 – victims, but a total of, say, 180 (because in 
a particular year the police have concentrated on cases of ‘international large-scale exploitation 
outside the sex industry’,23 which involve more victims on average). These 180 victims would then 
be reported to CoMensha and would be regarded as 5% of the total number of victims.

As a result, the estimate would come to 3,600 victims, which is more than twice the actual number 
of 1,380.24

The figure in this example would therefore be an overestimate, but it could as easily be an underestimate 
if the average number of victims of a human trafficking offence known to the police is smaller than the 
average number of victims per offence (for example, if the police actually concentrate on cases of ‘Do-
mestic small-scale sexual exploitation’,25 which, on average, involve fewer victims).

* To which forms of ‘hidden crime’ does the 5% refer? What forms of crime (violent crimes, sex crimes, 
drug crimes, white-collar crime, etc.) fall under the heading of ‘hidden crime’? In addition, it is unlikely 
that all forms of ‘hidden crime’ are concealed to the same extent. Even within the category of human 
trafficking there is very probably a difference in the degree of concealment between sexual exploitation 
and other forms of exploitation (and even within those two categories between different branches and 
sectors, such as between working for escort agencies or at home and window prostitution, for example). 
There are reasons to assume that there is more hidden human trafficking (a larger dark number) than 
other forms of ‘hidden crime’ (see §2.1 on victims who are unwilling or afraid to report it and/or deny it 

23 See Chapter 5.
24 In the case of a representative sample with, in this example, an average of 2.3 victims per human 

trafficking offence, the total would be 2.3x30=69 victims known to the police. These 69 victims 
would then be reported to CoMensha and regarded as 5% of the actual number of victims, so that the 
estimated total logically comes to the correct figure of 69x20=1,380 victims.

25 See Chapter 5.



Estimates of the scale of human trafficking
23

after being identified by third parties). At the same time, there are also reasons to assume that human 
trafficking is less hidden (a smaller dark number) than other forms of ‘hidden crime’ (see this section 
about an increasingly effective approach).

2.2.3 Reservations about assumption 2

Assumption 2: The police notify CoMensha about all possible victims of human trafficking known to them, as they 
are obliged to do26 (according to the CBA)

It is assumed that the police report all possible victims (100%) known to them to CoMensha. That is not 
the case in practice. According the police investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur,27 
of the 50 investigations completed in 2009 in which there were victims of sexual exploitation, it is only 
certain that the victims involved in 28 investigations (56%) were also reported to CoMensha.28 This rep-
resented 60% (N: 88) of the total of 147 victims that were involved in the 50 police investigations.29 It is 
likely that the proportion of victims of human trafficking known to the police that are actually reported 
to CoMensha has increased in recent years,30 so the effect of this reservations will steadily decline. But 
even now – in 2012 – reports are still being received from the field that victims are not being reported 
consistently. Consequently, the percentage of victims known to the police that are reported to CoMensha 
cannot be regarded as a constant factor. Changes in this factor are therefore wrongly attributed to deve-
lopments with respect to the scale of human trafficking.

2.2.4 Conclusion

There are too many reservations concerning the estimate of the number of victims of sexual exploitation 
in the Netherlands in the estimate of the CBA for it to be regarded as providing a good indication of the 
actual number. There are shortcomings in the method of calculation, and the assumptions on which 
the estimate was based do not appear to be correct, the chief among them being the assumptions that 
the percentage of victims known to the police is constant and that victims are consistently reported to 
CoMensha by the police.

2.3 A national estimate of victims of other forms of exploitation

FairWork31 made an estimate of the actual number of victims of human trafficking involving other forms 
of exploitation in the Netherlands in a recent publication entitled Verborgen slavernij in Nederland (Hidden 
slavery in the Netherlands).32 FairWork extrapolated its estimate for the Netherlands from an interna-
tional estimate by the ILO. Later in this section we express some reservations about this estimate, con-
cerning the method of calculation used (§2.3.1) and the assumptions on which the estimate is based 
(§2.3.2 and §2.3.3). In view of these reservations, the estimate cannot be regarded as in any way reliable 
(§2.3.4), although it does contribute to the process of criticism and improvement that could ultimately 
lead to a reasonably reliable national estimate. The international estimate by the ILO on which the 
national estimate is based is discussed in §2.4.

2.3.1 Reservations about the method of calculation
FairWork derived its estimate from an estimate by the ILO for the period 2002-2011. The ILO had estima-
ted that there are 880,000 victims33 of forced labour (sexual exploitation and other forms of exploitation, 
but not human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal) in the European Union (EU) at any given 
moment. Seventy percent of these victims are reportedly exploited in sectors other than the sex industry. 
Without further substantiation or consideration of the methodology employed by the ILO that formed 
the basis of its estimate, FairWork concluded that there are, accordingly, 30,000 victims of exploitation in 
the Netherlands, of whom 21,000 are victims of exploitation outside the sex industry. FairWork probably 
compared the population of the EU with the population of the Netherlands and calculated the number 
of victims of exploitation in the Netherlands on the basis of that ratio.34

(1) The first reservation to be made concerns the absence of an explanation of the method of calcula-
tion that was used, which means it is not clear precisely how FairWork arrived at the estimate for the 
Netherlands. (2) Furthermore, like the CBA, the ILO failed to give a reliability interval for its estimate at 
EU level – and FairWork likewise failed to do so for the estimate for the Netherlands.

31 FairWork originated from BlinN (Bonded Labour in the Netherlands), an initiative of the relief 
organisations Humanitas and Oxfam Novib (see also: www.fairwork.nu/english).

(the cumulative population of the Netherlands for ten years). If this ratio is applied to the number of 
880,000 victims of exploitation in the EU in this period, there would be more than 29,000 victims 
of exploitation in the Netherlands, of whom 70% (roughly 20,407) were victims of other forms of 
exploitation. These results are roughly the same as the results presented by FairWork (namely 30,000 
and 21,000). Note: this calculation is based on the aggregate of the current 27 member states for ten 
years, although in 2002 there were still only fifteen member states (Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic joined the EU in 2004 and Bulgaria 
and Romania in 2007). This is also the method used by the ILO. 



Estimates of the scale of human trafficking
25

2.3.2 Reservations about assumption 1

Assumption 1: National estimates can be derived automatically from international estimates (according to 
FairWork)

It is not possible to extrapolate estimates at a national level from international estimates without using 
the specific national data on which the international estimate was based. To produce an international 
estimate, various factors that can differ greatly between countries have to be generalised. For example, 
the ILO used a figure of 3.6% for the ratio of registered number of victims to actual number of victims. That figure 
of 3.6% therefore applies for the global estimate, but will not apply to every individual country.35 The same 
applies for the ratio of 30% victims of sexual exploitation and 70% victims of other forms of exploitation 
calculated by the ILO, which FairWork adopted for the Netherlands. This ratio applies at the global level, 
according to the ILO, but cannot simply be transposed to the national level.36

2.3.3 Reservations about assumption 2 
If FairWork did indeed calculate the number of victims of exploitation in the Netherlands pro rata to 
population, it made the following assumption.

Assumption 2: Victims of exploitation are proportionately (by population) divided among the countries of the EU 
(according to FairWork)

It is a fact that exploitation occurs everywhere and that no country is exempt. It is, however, naive to think 
that human trafficking occurs to the same extent everywhere. Just as the ILO’s total estimated number of 
victims of exploitation worldwide is not broken down pro rata to the populations of the various regions 
distinguished by the ILO, the same will apply for the breakdown of regions into countries. There are 
numerous factors that vary between countries and that could influence the opportunities provided for 
situations of exploitation.37 In addition, the measures taken to combat exploitation within a country 

35 The ILO derived the figure of 3.6% from the results of four national surveys, but this percentage will 
not apply for each of the four individual countries, only for the overarching region (in this case, the 
entire world). However, the ILO did use the percentage for the different regions (including the EU) but 
expressed the reservation itself that it would be better to calculate the percentage for each specific 
region. (In the absence of more national surveys, this is unfortunately impossible at the moment.) The 
only information known to the ILO at the national level for countries other than the four in which the 
national surveys were held is the estimated number of registered victims. The estimated number of registered 
victims in the Netherland could possibly be requested from the ILO. However, this is not the same as the 
number of victims registered by CoMensha, for example. It is the number estimated for the Netherlands 
by the ILO using the capture-recapture method (see §2.4). But even then, it is not possible to estimate 
the scale of exploitation in the Netherlands because even the ILO does not know what ratio to use to 
calculate the estimated registered number in the Netherlands. This would require a national survey.

36 There are factors that vary in each country, which could influence the ratio between sexual and other 
forms of exploitation. See, for example, the factors mentioned in footnote 37.

37 For example, differences between countries with regard to the level of prosperity, the unemployment 
rate, the ratio of skilled to unskilled work, the size of the sectors where there is a risk of exploitation, 
the size of the informal/hidden economy, etc.



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
26

are naturally also important.38 If this assumption is made, it would mean that every approach (ranging 
from none to very intensive) is equally effective (or fails to the same extent) because the percentage 
of victims would be the same everywhere. It follows from this that regardless of the efforts to prevent 
exploitation, victims will always be exploited to the same extent. In other words, there is nothing that 
can be done about exploitation. It can be assumed that this idea is as undesirable as it is untrue. The 
absence of opportunities for exploitation and the existence of good control should result in relatively 
fewer situations of exploitation and victims.

2.3.4 Conclusion
There are too many reservations concerning FairWork’s estimate of the number of victims of other forms 
of exploitation in the Netherlands to conclude that it provides a good indication of the actual number. 
No method of calculation is described, and the assumptions on which the estimate is based do not 
appear to be correct. The principal reservations are the fact that international estimates cannot auto-
matically be translated into national estimates and that victims of exploitation are not divided among 
countries in proportion to their populations.

2.4 An international estimate of forced labour

Efforts have also been made at the international level to estimate the number of victims of human traf-
ficking, but this presents even more obstacles than at a national level. Estimates of the total scale of 
human trafficking are based on the portion that is visible (registered victims), so it is first and foremost 
very important that the victims that are known are all consistently registered. However, the registration 
of victims of human trafficking can differ significantly from one country to another because of such 
factors as differences in definitions and priorities.39 Furthermore, many countries do not have a central 
registry for all probable victims known to every organisation, as the Netherlands has with CoMensha.40 

In 2005, for the first time, the ILO estimated that, in the period 1995-2004, there were a minimum41 of 
12.3 million42 victims of forced labour worldwide at any given moment. The ILO used the term ‘forced 
labour’ to refer to human trafficking with respect to both sexual exploitation and exploitation outside 

38 Perhaps unnecessarily, it should be noted here that the number of registered cases cannot be compared 
between countries (the registered numbers are not a good indicator of the actual scale within a 
country). After all, if exploitation is not looked for in a country, little or none will be found, and vice 
versa; if it is searched for properly, more will be found. It must not automatically be concluded from 
this that the scale of human trafficking is greater in the latter country than in the former country.

39 See also §7.1.1.
40 For more information about international data collection, see Chapter 7.
41 The estimate in 2005 was a minimum. This is not the case with the estimate in 2012, due in part to 

changes in the methodology (ILO 2012a, p. 11).
42 SE: 2,500,000 (20%). The range of this estimate lies between 9,800,000 and 14,800,000 victims. The 

reliability interval is 68%, which means that there is still a 32% chance that the estimate does not fall 
within that range (see also ILO 2005, p. 1; Gould 2010, pp. 38-39; ILO 2012a, p. 11). Generally, however, 
a reliability interval of 95% is used, so that the range of the estimate is wider (between 7,300,000 and 
17,300,000 victims).

the sex industry.43 Although this estimate was one of the most accurate and best substantiated estimates 
at the time, there were still some significant reservations, and the estimate could not be regarded as 
reliable.44 In 2012, the ILO produced a new international estimate that was based on a better methodol-
ogy. According to this estimate, there were 20.9 million45 victims worldwide at any given moment in the 
period 2002-2011.46 Despite improvements in the methodology compared with 2005, this estimate can 
also not be regarded as sufficiently reliable and needs further improvement. The estimate from 2012 is 
the focus of this section.47

ILO estimate in 2012
To arrive at the total estimate of 20.9 million victims worldwide, the ILO used a two-step method. Be-
cause it was not always clear what the total number of registered victims was in each individual country, 
the ILO first tried to estimate the total number of registered victims worldwide. It arrived at this estimate 
using a capture-recapture method, which is explained in the next section (see §2.4.1). It then calculated 
the total number of victims (registered victims and the dark number) (see §2.4.2), basing this calculation 
on national surveys conducted in four countries48 that had tried to measure how many actual victims of 
forced labour there were in those countries. Those results were compared with the estimated number of 
registered victims (using a capture-recapture method) in those four countries to calculate the proportion 
of the total population of victims of exploitation that was registered in those countries. A figure of 3.6% 
was ultimately derived from these four percentages. Finally, that figure was used to arrive at the actual 
total number of victims in the world. By also taking into account the duration of exploitation, the ILO 
was able to calculate how many victims there were at any given moment during the relevant period 
(2002-2011).

43 The definition of ‘forced labour’ refers to “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the 
menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily” (International 
Labour Convention, Forced Labour Convention, C29, 28 June 1930). This definition corresponds with 
the definition of human trafficking in the UN Palermo Protocol (United Nations Protocol to prevent, 
suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against transnational organized crime, Bulletin of Treaties. 2001, 68, Art. 3). The 
only difference is that human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal falls under the definition 
of human trafficking in the UN Palermo Protocol but not under the ILO’s definition of forced labour 
(see also: ILO 2012a, pp. 19-20).

44 For these reservations, see Gould (2010, pp. 26-50).
45 SE: 1,400,000 (7%). The range of this estimate then lies between 19,500,000 and 22,300,000 victims. 

The reliability interval is 68%, which means there is still a 32% chance that the estimate does not fall 
within that range (see also ILO 2012a). However, a reliability interval of 95% is usually adopted, so that 
the range of the estimate is wider (between 18,100,000 and 23,700,000 victims).

46 This estimate is based on a study covering the period 2002-2011 and means that at any given moment 
during these 10 years the given estimate could be the total number of victims.

47 The estimates in 2005 and 2012 cannot, in fact, be compared because of changes in methodology and 
the availability of additional new primary data sources (see also ILO 2012a, p. 11).

48 For political reasons, the ILO did not disclose which four countries these were (written information 
from the ILO, 11 December 2012).

2.4.1 International estimate of the total registered number
The method used by the ILO to estimate the total number of registered victims is explained below.49

Capture-recapture methodology
The capture-recapture method was originally developed to estimate the size of populations of certain 
species of animals for which no sample populations are available, such as the number of fish in 
a lake. Various variants were then developed to adapt the method for use in the social sciences. 
In criminology, for example, capture-recapture methods are used to estimate the total size of a 
so-called ‘hidden population’.

The ILO used the method to estimate the number of registered victims of forced labour worldwide 
(in other words, not the total actual number). The capture-recapture method involves first taking 
a sample of the population of registered victims (capture) and then a second sample from the same 
population (recapture). The portion of the sample in which registered victims are selected that ap-
pear in both samples (the overlap) is then determined. On the basis of these data, by means of a 
statistical calculation the total number of registered victims can be estimated. If the results of the 
samples are the same, it means that the entire number of registered victims is known. This will sel-
dom if ever be the case.

The capture-recapture method, as used by the ILO, has to meet four conditions. First, every registered 
victim must have the same chance of being included in each of the two samples. Second, the two sam-
ples must be taken independently of each other, which means that the fact that a victim is included in 
the first sample has no bearing on whether or not the same victim is included in the second sample.50 
A third condition is that it has to be a closed population; in other words, there is no change in the total 
number of registered victims during the research period (2002-2011). Finally, the victims included in both 
samples must be correctly identified as victims of forced labour. In other words, there must be no false 
positives (the inclusion of someone who is not actually a victim of forced labour).51

The result of this method (the total number of registered victims) is only reliable if all of the above condi-
tions are met.52 However, it is very likely that the conditions will not all be met. For example, because 
of differences in the registration systems used by different countries53 it is not easy to guarantee that 
every registered victim has an equal chance of being included in a sample.54 It also seems impossible to 

49 For a complete overview of the method, see ILO (2012a; 2012b).
50 The ILO tried to guarantee this independence by getting Team 1 and Team 2 (which performed sample 

1 and sample 2, respectively) to work separately from each other and not allowing them to share 
information (see also ILO 2012a, pp. 29-33).

51 See also Figure 1.1.
52 See also Gould 2010, pp. 40-41.
53 See also §7.7.1.
54 The ILO controlled for this by calculating the Poisson distribution, which controls that every case has 

an equal chance of being found. See also ILO 2012a, pp. 24-26; Gould 2010, pp. 40-41.

guarantee that the population in a study of human trafficking is a closed population.55,56 However, it 
can be assumed that the researchers were trained to ensure that all the victims selected for the sample 
were actually victims of forced labour.

2.4.2 International estimate of the total number (including the dark number) 
For the estimates in both 2005 and in 2012, the ILO used the results of the capture-recapture method to 
further calculate an estimate of the total number of victims worldwide. To do this, the probability that 
victims are registered has to be calculated in relation to the probability that victims are not registered 
(the so-called ‘dark number’). In 2012, on the basis of the four previously mentioned national surveys 
the ILO calculated which portion of the total population of victims of exploitation was registered.57 As 
already mentioned, the percentage of registered victims according to the ILO was 3.6% (compared with 
the total number of victims, including the dark number). This percentage was used to calculate the un-
registered portion of the population, leading to the ILO’s estimate of 20.9 million victims.58 

In order to draw conclusions about the number of victims at any given moment in the period 2002-2011 
on the basis of this estimate, the ILO included the average duration of exploitation in the calculation. 
In 2005, the ILO had already weighted the duration of exploitation, basing it on the condition that the 
longer a situation of forced labour endures, the greater the chance that it will come to light. For the es-
timate in 2012, the ILO says it also took into account the fact that the duration of exploitation of registered 
victims will very probably not be representative for the duration of exploitation of unregistered victims.59

Although the ILO estimate in 2012 is one of the most refined and reliable estimates to date, there are 
still a number of reservations to be expressed, some of which are mentioned here. (1) The figure of 3.6% 
is based on national surveys in only four countries but is used to make a worldwide estimate. The ILO 
itself acknowledges this reservations by saying that the value of 3.6% could be improved in future if more 
countries generate data from national surveys.60 (2) The ILO also says that there is a 68% probability 
that the actual number of victims is between 19,500.000 and 22,300,000. However, it is usual to adopt 
a reliability interval of 95%, which would mean that there is a 95% probability that the actual number is 
between 18,100,000 and 23,700,000 victims.61 (3) It is also plausible that there are flaws in the national 

55 For example, it is plausible that the registered portion of the victims in the Netherlands has increased 
because of improvements in the reporting and registration of victims.

56 The ILO reportedly corrected for this by weighting the duration of exploitation. The average duration of 
exploitation was already included for the 2005 estimate. For the 2012 estimate, however, the ILO made 
a number of changes in the method so that the duration of the exploitation could be considered in a 
more balanced way, by taking account of the fact that the known duration of exploitation of registered 
victims will very probably differ from the duration of exploitation of unregistered victims, for example 
(see Gould 2010, p. 41 and ILO 2012a, pp. 36-38).

57 The estimate in 2005 was based solely on secondary data sources from which no direct estimate could 
be made (see also: ILO 2012b, p. 8).

58 See ILO 2012a, pp. 38-39.
59 See ILO 2012a, pp. 36-38.
60 See ILO 2012a, p. 39.
61 See also Gould 2010, p.46.

surveys, which were carried out for the first time for the estimate in 2012. The surveys62 used and the 
target groups63 were different in the four countries where the national surveys were carried out.64 It 
is unclear what impact this had on the final result, and because the four countries where the national 
surveys were carried out are unknown,65 it is impossible to express an opinion on that.

When the above reservations – and any remarks that other experts may have – are taken into account, 
the method used by ILO to make the estimate in 2012 could be upgraded to improve the estimate of the 
number of victims of human trafficking at international level.

2.4.3 What next?

The scale of human trafficking is equal to the scale of the registered human trafficking (the known 
human trafficking) minus the false positives (the human trafficking that is registered as such but is 
not actually human trafficking) plus the dark number (the unregistered/unknown human trafficking, 
including the false negatives (the human trafficking that is seen but not recognised or registered as 
such). In short, it is the aggregate of the ‘visible’ and the ‘invisible’ human trafficking.

The preceding sections have shown how difficult it is to apply this formula. It seems very difficult to 
estimate the number of victims of human trafficking at a national level (and even more difficult to do 
so at the international level).

The aim of this chapter was to further the discussion about national and international estimates. Critical 
reflection on the estimates that have already been made, which will form the basis of future estimates, 
could ultimately result in a reasonably reliable estimate on which there is consensus. In that context, it 
is necessary to combine the knowledge of professionals engaged in the fight against human trafficking 
and statistical knowledge.

How can we arrive at a more reliable estimate for the Netherlands?
The discussions in this chapter lead to the conclusion that an estimate of the number of victims of 
human trafficking in the Netherlands should not be based on the number of registered victims and can 
also not be derived from an international estimate. A number of ideas that could be fleshed out to ar-
rive at a useful method of calculating this estimate are outlined below. For example, the possibility of a 
national survey66 in the Netherlands should be investigated. Can the target population be reached (since 
victims of human trafficking are often part of a hidden population)? Can the right questions be asked 
(since many victims of human trafficking do not regard themselves as victims)? Other methods could 
also be explored, such as methods that are already used to estimate other forms of hidden populations 
and crime at the national level.

standards measurement study or street survey (see also ILO 2012b, pp. 39-41).

Estimates of the scale of human trafficking
31

How can the Netherlands contribute to a more reliable international estimate?
The international estimate by the ILO in 2012 was based primarily on an estimate of the number of 
registered victims using a capture-recapture method. If all countries kept good records of the number 
of identified victims, this would no longer be necessary. The Netherlands could contribute to this by 
ensuring that CoMensha’s records are perfect, in the sense that they include all known victims and that 
the necessary information about all of these victims is known, such as the sector in which they were 
exploited, when the exploitation started, how long it lasted and where it took place. Investment in regis-
tration and reporting is therefore very important in this context. It will then be necessary to identify the 
proportion of false positives in the CoMensha records and to deduct that figure from the total number 
of reported victims. Finally, knowledge about the ratio between the number of registered victims and the 
actual number of victims (including the dark number) needs to be generated in far more than just the 
four countries on which the current estimate is based. One approach for the Netherlands, as mentioned 
in the previous paragraph, could be a national survey.

The number of victims at ‘any given moment’
If estimates are ultimately to say anything about the number of victims at ‘any given moment’ within a 
specific period, it is important to know the average duration of a period of exploitation. The information 
on this subject given below cannot be translated to the total population of victims67 but could lay the 
basis for further research.

Average duration of exploitation
According to the police investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur,68 the average 
period of exploitation is 12.3 months,69 based on the 109 victims involved in the 55 successfully 
completed investigations in 2009,70 the duration of whose exploitation was known.

According to the case law analysis of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur,71 the average length 
of the longest proven human trafficking offence per conviction72 was 366.0 days,73 based on the 69 
judgments rendered in first instance in 2010 that led to a conviction for at least human trafficking 
involving sexual exploitation.74 The period is almost the same for the fourteen convictions for at 
least other forms of exploitation, 365.6 days75.

67 The information in the box text is not based on a representative sample of the total population of 
victims. On this point, see Chapter 5 and National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d.

68 See Chapter 5.
69 On the basis of N: 109 (the duration of the exploitation of 48 victims was unknown); SD: 18.5 months.
70 The exploitation very probably took place in the years before 2009.
71 National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d, Table 15.
72 This often corresponds with the longest period of exploitation of a victim.
73 N: 69; SD: 419.3 days.
74 The investigations into these offences very probably took place before 2010 and the dates on which the 

offences were committed were earlier again. It is therefore very possible that these data overlap with 
the data in the police investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur.

75 N: 14; SD: 421.4 days.

Estimates with respect to the number of offenders and/or human trafficking situations
While most estimates relating to human trafficking concern victims, estimates relating to offenders or 
human trafficking situations are equally interesting. If a reasonably reliable mechanism for estimating 
the number of victims is found, these latter populations could also be calculated on the basis of infor-
mation about the average number of victims per offender or per human trafficking situation. Again, 
the information in the following text cannot be translated to the total population76 but could provide 
a basis for further research.

Average number of victims per human trafficking offence77

According to the police investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur78 46 of the 
55 successfully completed investigations into human trafficking in 200979 involved only sexual 
exploitation and a total of 119 victims. On average, therefore, there were 2.6 victims80 per investi-
gation/human trafficking offence.

According to the case law analysis of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur,81 the 111 judgments 
rendered in first instance in 201082 for at least sexual exploitation were related to 60 different 
human trafficking investigations involving a total of 147 unique victims of sexual exploitation. On 
average, therefore, there were roughly 2.5 victims per human trafficking investigation/offence.

76 The information in the box is not based on the representative sample of the total population victims. 
On this, see Chapter 5 and National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d.

77 According to the CBA on sexual exploitation in 2012 (KLPD-DNR 2012), there were 252 victims involved 
in the 37 investigations into sexual exploitation in which there was an international component (at 
least two victims were recruited abroad) that were studied and had been completed in the period 2007-
2010/11. On average, therefore, there were 6.8 victims in each investigation/human trafficking offence. 
Given the selection of investigations in the CBA on sexual exploitation in 2012, it is not surprising that 
the average number of victims per investigation differs so much from the average number according to 
the police investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur. After all, the investigations into 
the ‘more small-scale human trafficking’ and ‘domestic human trafficking’ (which, on average, involve 
a smaller number of victims, see Chapter 5) fall outside the scope of the CBA, as do the investigations 
in which victims were recruited in the Netherlands and put to work abroad.

78 See Chapter 5.
79 The dates of commission were very probably in the years before 2009.
80 SD: 2.8 victims (the smallest number of victims per investigation was one victim and the largest was 15).
81 National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d.
82 The investigations into these offences very probably took place before 2010 and offences were probably 

committed even earlier. It is therefore very possible that these data overlap with the data in the police 
investigation study of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur.

3.1 Introduction

This chapter focuses on the victims of human trafficking who were reported to the Coordination Centre 
for Human Trafficking (CoMensha) in the period 2007-2011. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the focus of this 
report is on trends in the Netherlands, and this chapter is therefore a summary of Chapter 3 in the Dutch 
report Mensenhandel in en uit Beeld, which was published in December 2012.1

Insight into the number of (known) victims of human trafficking and their characteristics is important 
for an understanding of the nature and scale of the problem. CoMensha is the central reporting agency 
of victims of human trafficking in the Netherlands. Every possible victim of human trafficking in the 
Netherlands should be reported to CoMensha by the individual or organisation that has identified that 
person (or by the victim personally). The task of registering possible victims for the purposes of the Na-
tional Rapporteur’s reporting has been delegated to CoMensha.2 The National Rapporteur is responsible 
for analysing the quantitative data on the basis of which policy can be formulated.

CoMensha’s core task is to register possible victims of human trafficking. It also coordinates efforts to ar-
range shelter for victims and is responsible for providing the victims and those that have reported offen-
ces with the information they require.3 Accordingly, CoMensha registers three categories of notification:
– notifications exclusively for the purpose of registration;
– notifications where information and advice is also sought about the options available to a possible 

victim; and
– notifications where there is also a request for shelter for the possible victims in the Netherlands.

(PPS) and in the B9 regulation. The B9 regulation designates CoMensha as the organisation responsible 
for arranging shelter for (possible) victims of human trafficking during the reflection period and if they 
are granted a B9 permit (see also the Instructions on Human Trafficking from the PPS, Government 
Gazette. 2008, 2718; section 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 of the B9-regulation).

In §3.2 a number of recent developments concerning the registration of victims of human trafficking 
and the provision of shelter for victims are described, while §3.3 presents a summary of current trends 
and developments in the Netherlands.

3.2 Recent developments 
This section discusses recent developments relating to registration and shelter for victims.

CoMensha registration system
One of CoMensha’s key tasks is to register possible victims of human trafficking, including possible 
victims. In previous reports, the National Rapporteur has repeatedly referred to the importance of ac-
curate records for the collection of reliable quantitative data about human trafficking.4 The Minister of 
Security and Justice also referred to the importance of improving the registration of underage victims 
in a letter to parliament on 3 July 2012.5

The minister has earmarked additional funds to improve the registration by CoMensha.6 A project entit-
led ‘The Modernisation of Registration by CoMensha’ has also been started,7 with the aim of improving 
registration by determining, in consultation with the partners, the necessary dataset and securing a 
commitment from the notifiers to supply the information consistently and adequately. CoMensha is cur-
rently reviewing the possibilities of implementing a different registration system, designed to improve 
the accuracy and completeness of the information about reported victims.8 The Bureau of the National 
Rapporteur is also involved in this process.

Notifiers
For some time CoMensha has been referring to the importance of expanding the duty to report possible 
victims to all the relevant agencies.9 At present, only the police, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee 
and the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment have a duty to report,10 but there 
have been signals from the field that these agencies do not always comply with their duty and that the

information they provide is not always accurate.11 It is essential that the existing duty to report is com-
plied with and that the information supplied to CoMensha is accurate.

At the same time, it is very important to increase the number of notifications of victims by organisati-
ons other than the police, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee and the Inspectorate of the Ministry of 
Social Affairs and Employment.12 Human trafficking is often hidden, so that a large number of victims 
are probably unknown, but there are also some that are known to particular organisations but who are 
not reported to CoMensha.13 With regard to this group, in the Seventh report, the National Rapporteur 
recommended that every relevant organisation should report every victim of any form of human traf-
ficking to CoMensha.14

Shelter
Article 11 (5) of the EU Directive on Human Trafficking requires member states to provide assistance and 
support for victims, including the provision of appropriate and safe accommodation.15 CoMensha has 
expressed its concern about the rise in the number of places required in shelters – there is still a shortage 
despite the creation of additional places for categorical shelter.16 A shortage of initial and longer-term 
accommodation leads to longer waiting lists, making it impossible to arrange immediate shelter for 
victims. The shortage of adequate shelter for victims in the Netherlands has been an item on the policy 
agenda for a number of years. In 2010, the Ministries of Security and Justice and Health, Welfare and 
Sport provided funding for additional places in shelters, the so-called ‘Categorical Shelter for Victims of 
Human Trafficking’ (COSM), which has been a crucial development in terms of the protection of victims 
in recent years. In 2010, there were 50 places for the COSM programme divided among shelters run by 
three organisations: Prostitutie Maatschappelijk Werk (PMW), Amsterdams Coördinatiepunt Mensenhandel (ACM) 
and Zorggroep Jade.17 The Minister of Security and Justice promised to expand the categorical shelter to 
70 places with effect from 1 July 2012. If that expansion proved inadequate, the Minister said he would

12 On the grounds of Article 10 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Hu-

man Beings government authorities that come in contact with possible victims (such as the police, but 
also municipal authorities) can identify them and refer them to an organisation that can assist them 
(Warsaw, 16 May 2005, Bulletin of Treaties. 2006).

13 A substantial proportion of unaccompanied, underage asylum seekers are, in any case, not reported 
to CoMensha. See also §3.3.2.

14 This refers to victims of both sexual and other forms of exploitation, as well as Dutch and non-Dutch 
victims. See also National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2009, recommendation 42. 

15 Directive 2011/36/EU, Article 11 (5).
16 Because of the discussion about the shortage of adequate and appropriate shelter for victims of hu-

man trafficking, the Ministry of Justice’s Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) conducted an 
evaluation of categorical accommodation and assistance for adult victims of human trafficking in four 
European countries (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Italy and Spain). One of the aims of the study was 
to provide input for the further implementation of categorical shelter in the Netherlands (Glasgow et 
al., 2012).

take additional measures, possibly including a further expansion of the number of places for categori-

3.3 Trends and developments in the Netherlands
This section summarises the information about (possible) victims that were reported to CoMensha in 
the period 2007-2011.

3.3.1 Notes to the figures
The CoMensha records will always be only an approximation of the actual situation. The figure below 
gives an indication of the victims reported to CoMensha in relation to the total number of possible 
victims of human trafficking.19

human trafficking is not known. However, there are estimates of the total number at national and 
international level (see Chapter 2).

This figure gives an indication of the (unknown) total number of victims of human trafficking, only some 
of whom are probably known to CoMensha. Given the nature of the offence, the number of possible 
victims will always contain a ‘dark number’.20 In addition, the Bureau of the National Rapporteur receives 
signals from the field that the number of known possible victims is greater than the number reported 
to CoMensha.21 To formulate the best policy to protect possible victims of human trafficking, at least 
those victims that are known to authorities but are not reported22 must be reported to CoMensha.23 It is 
also possible that registered victims are not actually victims at all,24 since all possible victims of human 
trafficking are reported to CoMensha.

3.3.2 Trends
This section sets out the main findings from quantitative data about victims of human trafficking repor-
ted to CoMensha in the period 2007-2011.

The number of registered victims in 2011 (N: 1,222) was almost 77% higher than in 2007 (N: 716).25 Almost 
as many possible victims were reported to CoMensha in the last five years (2007-2011) (N: 4,666) as in the 
ten-year period from 2000 to 2009 (N: 5,084).26 The number of notifications of victims has been rising 
sharply since 2006,27 continuing by an average of 14% up to 2011. In 2011, there was a relatively large in-
crease of 23% compared with 2010, which is noteworthy. An increase in the number of reported victims 
could mean that human trafficking is increasing in the Netherlands, but is more likely an indication that 
more victims are being identified and that the reporting and registration of victims has improved. For 
example, a partial explanation of the sharp increase in 2011 could be the fact that in that year CoMensha 
made agreements with regional police forces on the structural reporting of victims.28 

20 The large circle in Figure 3.1 illustrates the total number of actual victims of human trafficking, a 
substantial proportion of whom are unknown (on the left of the figure).

21 For example, Stichting Nidos, which is responsible for exercising guardianship over every unaccompanied 
underage asylum seeker in the Netherlands, does not report unaccompanied underage asylum seekers 
who are potential victims of human trafficking to CoMensha.

22 In Figure 3.1, this is the section in the bottom right of the circle: ‘Known to authorities, but not 
reported’.

23 CoMensha stresses the importance of expanding the duty to report to every authority that could have 
contact with victims of human trafficking (CoMensha 2012, p.6). See also the earlier recommendation by the 
National Rapporteur in National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2009, recommendation 42. 

24 In Figure 3.1, this is the dark-blue section outside the circle.
25 The number of possible victims reported to CoMensha each year in the period 2007-2011 was as follows: 

2007: 716; 2008: 826; 2009: 909; 2010: 993; 2011: 1,222.

Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
40

On average, 65% of all notifications (N: 4,84529) in the period 2007-2011 came from the police, peaking 
at 76% in 2011. The figure below shows the sources of most notifications of possible victims of human 
trafficking over the entire period from 2007 to 2011.

Figure 3.2 Notifiers (total for 2007-2011)

Personal characteristics of reported victims 
The proportion of men among the victims almost trebled between 2007 and 2011. In 2011, almost one-
fifth, or 19% (=226), of the total number of reported victims were male. Exploitation in sectors other than 
the sex industry was criminalised with effect from 1 January 2005.30 This, and the subsequent increase in 
the number of investigations of other forms of exploitation, very probably explains the increase in the 
proportion of men in the CoMensha records. There has also been an increase in the number of notifi-
cations of large groups of possible victims in cases of other forms of exploitation, which often involve 
a relatively larger number of men than women. 

Of all the possible victims reported to CoMensha (N: 4,666), the largest group (39% on average) is between 
the ages of 18 and 23, with more than 81% younger than 31. There has been a slight increase in the number 
of reported victims aged over 30, a category that represented almost a quarter (24%) of the total of 1,222 
victims reported in 2011, compared with only just over a tenth (12%) of the 716 victims reported in 2007. 
A partial explanation of this increase in the proportion of victims in older age groups is the increase in 

29 The total number of notifiers in the period 2007-2011 (N: 4,845) is higher than the total number of 
victims in that period (N: 4,666) because notifications about some victims were made by more than 
one institution or person. 

30 Up to and including 2005, scarcely any male victims were reported to CoMensha (National Rapporteur 
on Trafficking in Human Beings 2010, p. 92).

are older than 30.31 It should be noted that this is the age of the victims at the time they are reported to

Almost one-third (32%) of the victims reported to CoMensha in the period 2007-2011 (N: 4,666) possessed 
Dutch nationality, making this the most common nationality. The following table shows the five most

Underage victims
The registration of underage victims needs to be improved, as the Minister of Security and Justice also 
noted in the letter to parliament on 3 July 2012.33 There are signals from the shelters that the number 
of possible victims is larger than CoMensha’s figures suggest. Unaccompanied underage asylum seek-
ers who might be victims of human trafficking come into contact with Stichting Nidos, the agency that 
acts as their guardian.34 Because Nidos does not report them to CoMensha, a substantial proportion of 
possible victims cannot be included in the analyses in this chapter. A more comprehensive picture of 
underage victims would enhance efforts to formulate an informed policy for tackling human trafficking 
involving this group. In the interests of more complete registration, the Bureau of the National Rappor-

31 CoMensha 2012, p. 11.
32 In the context of CoMensha’s plans for a new method of registration, the Bureau of the National Rap-

porteur has advised it to register the ages of victims at the time they first became victims of human 
trafficking. 

33 Parliamentary Documents II 2011/12, 28 638, no. 90, p. 2. See also Parliamentary Documents II 2011/12, 28 639, 
no. 72; Parliamentary Documents II 2011/12, 28 638, no. 166.

34 Stichting Nidos assumes guardianship of every unaccompanied underage alien in the Netherlands, unless 
the minor has reached the age of 17½ and is regarded as sufficiently independent (Kromhout et al., 
2010, p. 21).

teur intends to conduct research into possible victims among unaccompanied underage aliens in order 
to supplement the existing CoMensha figures.

The proportion of reported underage victims in relation to the total number of reported victims declined 
from 28% (=199) in 2007 to 12% (=111) in 2009, before rising again to 16% (=195) in 2011. Most of the re-
ported underage victims have Dutch nationality. The following table shows the rankings of the top five 
nationalities of underage victims in the period 2007-2011.

Sector of exploitation
Exploitation in the sex industry increased in the period 2007-2011, peaking at 75% (=749) of the total 
number of registered victims in 2010. The proportion of victims of exploitation in sectors outside the 
sex industry also increased – from 6% in 2007 to 20% in 2011 – which can be partially explained by the 
fact that other forms of exploitation were criminalised later.35 The increases are also partially due to 
improvements in CoMensha’s records.

Exploitation within the sex industry can occur in various domains, including street prostitution, window 
prostitution, sexual exploitation in a private home,36 sexual exploitation in private business premises,37 
in massage parlours, by webcam, Internet prostitution, escort services and/or sexual exploitation in a 

35 All forms of sexual exploitation have been a criminal offence since 1 October 2000; other forms of 
sexual exploitation have been a criminal offence since 1 October 2002. Exploitation outside the sex 
industry was criminalised in 2005 (Article 250a of the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC); Article 273f DCC; 
Explanatory Memorandum, Parliamentary Documents 2003-2004, 29 291, no. 3).

36 For sexual exploitation in a private house, the victim must receive clients in a private house, usually 
the home of the person who has trafficked him or her (CoMensha 2012, p. 15).

37 For sexual exploitation in private premises, the victim must receive clients in business premises, which 
are generally not a home (CoMensha 2012, p. 15).



Registered victims in the Netherlands

brothel.38 Other forms of exploitation occurred mainly in agriculture and horticulture in the period 
2007-2011, but also in au-pair services, construction, crime, drug trafficking, the hospitality sector, do-
mestic work, cleaning work, abattoirs, the textile industry and the food industry. Some victims reported 
to CoMensha were known to have been subjected to non-sexual exploitation, but it was not known in 
which sector. These cases involved 4% of the total number of reported victims in the period 2007-2011.

It is increasingly the case that groups of (possible) victims are reported to CoMensha, primarily in re-
lation to exploitation outside the sex industry, but also, in a smaller number of cases, in relation to 
sexual exploitation. To illustrate, in an operation by The Hague police in the city’s red light district 
(Doubletstraat) in 2011, the police interviewed 157 prostitutes, 30 of whom were ultimately reported to 
CoMensha as possible victims of human trafficking.39

While there are very few instances of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal or forced com-
mercial surrogacy in the figures for (possible) victims of human trafficking in the period 2007-2011,40 in 
her study of these forms of human trafficking, the National Rapporteur noted the need to remain alert 
to them because there seems to be a growing market in organs and forced surrogacy, due in part to the 
globalisation of society and the internet.41 

Profiles of victims in the Netherlands
This section shows links between the personal characteristics of victims, the sectors in which they are 
exploited and whether or not an offence is reported to the police by the victim. These links can be 
influenced by other factors, however, and it seems reasonable to assume that the various links can be 
related to the distinction between the circumstances of victims of sexual exploitation and of exploitation 
outside the sex industry. Table 3.3 presents the key information about the reported victims of each form 
of exploitation. Most reported victims were exploited in the sex industry.

38 For the vast majority of the victims reported to CoMensha who were exploited in the sex industry, it is 
not known what form the exploitation took.

Shaded areas show the largest groups in each form of exploitation

As Table 3.3 shows, characteristics that are shared by many of the victims who are exploited in the sex 
industry are the following: they are female (69%); they are younger than 31 (83%); they are frequently 
from Africa (35%) and countries that were member states of the European Union (EU) in 1995 (particularly

victims in sectors outside the sex industry are often the following: they are male (57%); they are older 
than victims of sexual exploitation (48% are aged 31 or older); they come from countries that joined the 
EU in 2004 or 2007 (56%) and from Asia (17%). The majority did not report the offence (60%). These figu-
res need to be qualified to a certain extent. For example, the group that did report the offence consisted 
mainly of victims with African and Asian nationalities. Reported victims who were nationals of a country 
that was an EU member state in 1995 (particularly the Netherlands) or that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007 
often did not report the offence.

Shelter
Of all the notifications in the period 2009-2011, 24% (=772) included a request for shelter. CoMensha 
arranges accommodation for possible victims who are living legally in the Netherlands.49,50 In absolute 
terms, the number of victims requiring shelter rose from 201 in 2009 to 280 in 2011. The number of 
reported victims requiring shelter for whom initial shelter could be arranged was only known for 2010 
and 2011. 

The following figure shows the proportion of reported victims requiring shelter, for whom CoMensha 
could organise initial accommodation, in the period 2010-2011.

Figure 3.4 shows that almost a third (32%, = 161) of all the victims requiring shelter in 2010 and 2011 (N:

perates. In total, CoMensha was able to arrange initial shelter for more than three-quarters (76 %, = 386) 
of the victims who were reported to it and who required shelter.

For 24% (= 119), no initial shelter was found:51

–  13% (= 65) no longer required shelter for various reasons: the client no longer wanted CoMensha to 
arrange initial shelter because it was taking too long, because the client had already found accom-
modation or for some other reason (unknown);52

–  7% (= 35) were allocated emergency accommodation because there was no place in a proper shelter;
–  For 2% (= 9), CoMensha was unable to find emergency accommodation or a place in a shelter.53 At the 

time of the notification, the reported victims had been staying in an asylum centre (6), living with 
others (2) or staying in the shelter for minors (1).

–  2% (= 10) had left for an unknown destination after the notification.

51 Reference date for the figures for 2010: 8 July 2011. Reference date for the figures for 2011: 31 March 2012.
52 In the majority of cases, the clients no longer wanted accommodation. There could be various reasons 

for this. If it has taken a long time for CoMensha to find a place, the client might have started looking 
for somewhere him- or herself and then moved in with family or friends, for example. Because of the 
waiting lists for shelters, this does happen (written information from CoMensha, 18 July 2012).

53 Accommodation has since been found for most of these persons (written information from CoMensha, 
18 July 2012).



4  Victims and the B9 regulation in the 
Netherlands

4.1 Introduction

This chapter reviews the data regarding all victims1 of human trafficking with a temporary residence 
permit on the grounds of the B9 regulation, which applies for aliens who are or might be victims of 
human trafficking or witnesses to human trafficking and who do not have a valid residence permit.2 

This chapter discusses the B9 regulation and is a summary of Chapter 4 in the Dutch report Mensenhandel 
in en uit beeld, which was published in December 2012.3 The chapter starts with an outline of the relevant 
policy framework in §4.2. In §4.3, statistics are presented about victims who have availed of the reflec-
tion period and/or applied for B9 status and, in §4.4, data about victims who were granted a B9 residence 
permit or whose applications were rejected. 

4.2  Policy

4.2.1 Policy framework
The B9 regulation (Chapter B9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000) provides that aliens 
who are or might be victims of or witnesses to human trafficking may temporarily remain legally in the 
Netherlands during the investigation and prosecution in order to remain available to the police and 
Public Prosecution Service (PPS).4 At the same time, victims are entitled to a number of facilities under 
the regulation. When the police or other government authorities discover an alien who might be a victim 

1 In this chapter, every person who has availed of the reflection period and/or reported a human trafficking 
offence is regarded as a victim.

2 For a detailed explanation of the B9 regulation, see National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human 
Beings 2009, Chapter 5.

3 Nationaal Rapporteur Mensenhandel 2012f, Chapter 4.
4 Nationals of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland can also 

derive rights from the B9 regulation insofar as they cannot derive any rights from Community law. The 
scope is therefore wider than the B9 regulation would initially lead one to suspect.

of human trafficking – during administrative checks, for example5 – they must, if there is even a slight 
indication of human trafficking, refer them to the rights laid down in the B9 regulation, as well as to 
the possibility of taking time to reflect. The reflection period – of up to three months – gives victims the 
time to decide whether they want to report an offence or otherwise cooperate with an investigation and 
prosecution. During the reflection period, the authority to deport the victim from the Netherlands is 
temporarily suspended.6 According to the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000, the idea behind 
the regulation is that the suspension of deportation or the granting of a temporary residence permit is 
justified by the importance of victims who report an offence or otherwise cooperate with an investiga-
tion remaining available to the PPS for an extended period. The B9 regulation also applies to witnesses 
who report a case of human trafficking. Because the regulation is intended to ensure that aliens remain 
available to the police and PPS, but has been given the form of a residence permit, it has a somewhat 
hybrid character; on the one hand, it serves the interests of the investigation and prosecution, while, on 
the other, it creates rights for the victim concerned. A simplified presentation of the route that victims 
can take under the B9 regulation is shown in Figure 4.1.

The reflection period is essential to give victims the time to recover, to escape from the influence of the 
human trafficker and to allow themselves to make an informed and carefully considered decision on 
whether to report a human trafficking offence or otherwise cooperate with the police and PPS.8 Under 
international legislation, the Netherlands is required to offer victims of human trafficking a period 
to recover and reflect,9 and the police must inform a victim of human trafficking of the possibility of 
requesting a reflection period. During the reflection period (which is granted only once and may not be 
extended beyond the maximum period of three months)10, victims may remain legally in the country11 
and are also entitled to certain facilities, including an allowance to support themselves, medical assis-
tance and legal aid, if necessary. The victim may not perform work during the reflection period.

There are four situations in which the reflection period ends before the three months have elapsed. First, 
it ends if the victim has left for an unknown destination during the reflection period. Second, the victim 
may decide during the reflection period not to report an offence or otherwise cooperate with the inves-
tigation into the suspect, in which case it also ends. Third, if the victim does decide to report an offence 
or otherwise cooperate with a criminal investigation into the suspect the reflection period will end. This 
cooperation with the investigation is regarded ex officio as a B9 application.12 Finally, the reflection period 
ends if the victim submits an application for a residence permit on grounds other than the B9 regulation.

A victim may choose not to use the reflection period and immediately cooperate with the investigation. 
A victim of human trafficking qualifies for a B9 residence permit if he or she has reported the offence or 
has otherwise cooperated with the criminal investigation or prosecution, as long as the criminal inves-
tigation and prosecution (or the trial in first instance) has not been completed.13 Witnesses of human 
trafficking can also apply for a B9 residence permit and the associated facilities.14

Since 22 December 2010, a victim who is unable or unwilling to report an offence because of serious 
threats or because of medical or psychological impediments can be granted a temporary residence per-
mit on the grounds of Section 12 of the B9 regulation,15 even without cooperating with the criminal 

8 Section 3.2 of the B9 regulation. See also the Letter from the National Rapporteur to the Minister for 
Immigration, Integration and Asylum, reference 8060; Nationaal Rapporteur Mensenhandel 2012b;

13 Since 14 November 2007, other forms of cooperation with the police and/or PPS have also been regar-

15 This involves temporary residence on the basis of Article 3.4 (3) of the Aliens Decree 2000 (and thus not 

B9). For this reason, the applications and permits granted under section 12 of the B9 regulation are not

investigation.16 This policy, which is based on Article 3.4 (3) of the Aliens Decree 2000, has only been 
relied on to a limited extent.17 A final decision on whether to apply this article is based on a statement 
by the police that the individual concerned is a victim of human trafficking and that he or she faces a 
serious threat and/or is suffering from a medical or psychological impediment.18 The box below contains 
an example of an official report on the basis of which temporary residence was granted on these grounds.

Temporary residence without cooperation with the investigation19

In May 2012, a woman from Sierra Leone entered a police station in the Brabant region in a dis-
traught state. After closing the doors and the blinds on the windows, she sat on the ground and 
explained how she had come to the Netherlands because of false promises (of a good life in the 
Netherlands and marriage). Having arrived in the Netherlands, she was locked up in a house, where 
she had to have sex with a number of men, the payments for which were made to the human 
trafficker. The police conducted an intake interview with the woman, but during this interview the 
police observed that her condition was rapidly deteriorating and that she was unable to continue 
with the interview. The woman was reported to CoMensha, which took her to a secret address, 
where staff declared that ‘the woman was very fearful and did not want to be left alone for a 
moment.’ For this reason, the woman was placed in a crisis centre for psychiatric patients the next 
day, where efforts would be made to calm her, prescribe medication and make a diagnosis. Within 
a few days, the doctor from the municipal mental health institution who was treating her declared 
that she ‘is still very disturbed, sleeps badly and does not feel safe and an effort will first have to 
be made to win her trust and calm her before anything can be done to stabilise her and prescribe 
medication.’ The woman was granted a temporary residence permit on the grounds of Section 12 
of the B9 regulation.

In addition to regular residence in the Netherlands, the B9 residence permit entitles recipients to faci-
lities such as shelter and accommodation, medical assistance, legal aid and special facilities to support 
themselves.20 A victim with a B9 residence permit is allowed to work.21

In principle, a B9 residence permit is granted for a year and is valid as long as a criminal investigation 
is underway. The residence permit is withdrawn if the case is dismissed, in which case an objection can 
be made on the grounds of Article 12 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (DCCP). The right to tem-

16 See section 12 of the B9 regulation (Government Gazette. 2010, 20701, p. 15). Because of the abolition 
of legal residence pending an appeal (Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees 2012, 359), the B9 regulation 
was amended and section B9/13 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000 was renumbered as 
section B9/12 (Government Gazette. 2012, 15972, p. 3).

17 There were fewer than ten in 2011 and 2012 (written information from the Immigration and Naturali-
sation Service (IND), 17 July 2012 and 12 October 2012).

18 The medical complaints must be substantiated by information provided by a practitioner registered in 
the Register of Individual Health Care Professions (BIG register) or with the Netherlands Institute of 
Psychologists (NIP). Serious threats by the human trafficker must be attested to by a statement from 
the police (section 12 of the B9 regulation).

porary residence in the Netherlands during the objection procedure was abolished with effect from 1 
August 2012.22 That decision was one of the measures taken to make the B9 regulation less susceptible 
to abuse.23

B9 applications are sometimes rejected (see §4.4.3). The grounds for rejection are listed in Article 16 of 
the Aliens Act;24 however, four of the grounds mentioned in Article 16 do not apply to victims of human 
trafficking.25 First, the absence of a valid permit for temporary residence cannot be used against a victim 
of human trafficking. Second, a B9 application cannot be rejected by reason of a threat to public order 
if the breach of public order is directly connected with human trafficking. Third, the application cannot 
be rejected because the individual does not possess a basic knowledge of the Dutch language and Dutch 
society. Finally, a B9 residence permit can also not be denied because the individual does not have a 
passport.26 

4.2.2 The policy in practice
The purpose of the B9 regulation is to keep aliens available to the police and PPS. On the one hand, this 
is in the interests of the investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, it is also intended to protect 
victims. In addition to granting legal residence, the B9 regulation contains a number of provisions de-
signed to afford this protection.

In practice, there are two problems. First, there is sometimes a lengthy period between the time when 
the B9 residence permit is granted and when the physical permit is issued. Without a passport or resi-
dence document, victims cannot identify themselves. For example, they have to be registered with the 
municipality where they live in order to apply for health insurance and social security benefits. Because 
they only receive the physical residence permit later, victims who do not have any other means of identi-
fication often remain in a reception centre for an unnecessarily lengthy period, which causes additional 
expense. CoMensha raised this problem with the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations at the 
end of 2011,27 and the National Rapporteur has previously recommended that the procedure for issuing 
a residence permit to victims under the B9 regulation should be accelerated.28 The municipality of The 
Hague has found a practical solution for this problem by allowing registration without a passport or a 
residence permit if the victim submits the letter from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) 
showing that a B9 residence permit has been granted, together with the report of the offence.29 Another 
problem is that there is no policy governing the residence of children whose parents are victims and are 
using the reflection period. The regulation of legal residence for these children, along with the associa-
ted facilities, could prevent children of victims of human trafficking from being caught in a bureaucratic

no man’s land.30 Another issue that is regarded as a problem in practice is the so-called ‘abuse of the B9 
regulation’. The National Rapporteur reported at length on this problem in the Seventh report31 and it 
was also the subject of a report earlier this year.32

4.3 Reflection period and B9 applications

4.3.1 Notes to the figures
For the first time, the Bureau of the National Rapporteur has received figures from the IND relating to the 
reflection period. In this section, on the basis of these figures and the figures regarding B9 applications 
in 2010 and 2011, comparisons are made between three categories of victims:
– victims of human trafficking who used the reflection period but ultimately did not make a B9 ap-

plication (‘Reflection period without B9 application’);
– victims of human trafficking who used the reflection period and made a B9 application (‘B9 applica-

tion and reflection period’); and
– victims of human trafficking who made a B9 application but who did not use the reflection period 

(‘B9 application without reflection period’).

4.3.2 Reflection period in 2010 and 2011
In 2010, 256 victims used the reflection period; the number rose by 40% to 357 in 2011. The number of 
B9 applications rose more slowly, from 350 in 2010 to 417 in 2011, an increase of 19%. The figure below 
shows the number of persons who used the reflection period in 2010 and 2011 and whether they subse-
quently applied for a B9 permit.

30 Children of victims of human trafficking are in fact entitled to shelter according to the pilot project on 
categorical shelter for victims of human trafficking, regardless of whether they are covered by the B9 
regulation: ‘The target group of the (pilot) categorical shelter consists of victims of human trafficking, 
women, men and any accompanying children.’ (Document describing shelter for victims of trafficking 
in human beings, for the Ministry of Security and Justice, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relati-
ons and Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, 2012).

Figure 4.2 Reflection period in 2010 and 2011

As Figure 4.2 shows, 26% (=66) of cases in 2010 where the reflection period was used did not result in a 
B9 application, compared with 43% (=155) in 2011.33 The absence of a B9 application might indicate that 
the individuals concerned did not cooperate with the investigation;34 however, it is also possible that 
an individual did cooperate with an investigation after the reflection period, but did not wish to avail 
of the B9 regulation,35 perhaps because they wanted to return to their country of origin, for example, 
or preferred to wait for another procedure to secure residence (for example, an asylum procedure).36

4.3.3 Reflection period and B9 applications in 2010 and 2011
Three categories are described in the remainder of this section: ‘Reflection period without B9 appli-
cation’ (N: 221), ‘Reflection period and B9 application’ (N: 392) and ‘B9 application without reflection 

33 Of those who used the reflection period in 2011, 43% (=155) did not make a B9 application in 2011. It 
is possible that some of the victims who used the reflection period in the last three months of 2011 
still made a B9 application in 2012. There were 46 persons (13%) who used the reflection period from 
October 2011, which could reduce the total number of victims who used the reflection period and did 
not make a B9 application from 43% (=155) to 31% (=109).

34 There are a number of possible reasons for not cooperating with the investigation: for some victims of 
human trafficking using the reflection period it was found that no reports of offences were included 
because there had been no follow-up to an investigation; a number of victims had departed for an un-
known destination; and some persons using the reflection period proved to be children of the person 
who reported an offence (if a parent is granted a B9 permit, the child can apply for residence on the 
basis of family reunification) (Enquiries to the police, October 2012).

35 This was confirmed by the IND (written information from the IND on 25 October 2012).

application in 2010 and 2011.

The figure below shows the proportions of the total number of persons that used the reflection period 
and/or made a B9 application in 2010 and 2011.

Figure 4.3 Reflection period and/or B9 regulation (total of 2010-2011) 

As Figure 4.3 shows, the largest group fall into the category ‘Reflection period and B9 application’ (40%), 
followed by the category ‘B9 application without reflection period’ (38%). Almost a quarter (22%) of the 
total used the reflection period without subsequently making a B9 application. 

Reflection period without B9 application (2010-2011)
Relatively speaking, male victims use the reflection period without making a subsequent B9 application 
more often than female victims (26% of the total number of male victims compared with 21% of the 
total number female victims). Furthermore, a lot of the victims in this category were between 18 and 25 

37 Of the total number of persons who made a B9 application in 2010 and 2011 (N: 767), 51% (= 392) first 
used the reflection period and 49% (=375) did not. These figures include 71 persons who made a B9 
application in the first three months of 2010. It is possible that they used the reflection period in the 
last three months of 2009 (a maximum of 7% of the total number of B9 applications in 2010 and 2011).

years of age (39%) and were often Polish (20%),38 Nigerian (17%) or Hungarian (12%). The largest group 
comprised nationals of member states that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 (43%). The police regions 
in which most requests for a reflection period were made without a subsequent B9 application were 
Brabant Zuid-Oost (23%), Amsterdam-Amstelland (17%) and Groningen (10%).

Reflection period and B9 applications (2010-2011)
Female victims use the reflection period and then make a B9 application relatively more often than male 
victims (43% compared with 29%). Victims in the category ‘Reflection period and B9 application’ are 
often aged between 18 and 25 (40%) and are frequently Nigerian (33%), followed by Sierra Leonean (9%) 
and Guinean (6%). The vast majority (71%) have an African nationality. The police regions in which the 
reflection period was used and followed up with a B9 application most often were Haaglanden (17%), 
Amsterdam-Amstelland (16%) and Rotterdam-Rijnmond (11%).

B9 application without reflection period (2010-2011)
Male victims made a B9 application without first making use of the reflection period relatively more 
often than women (46% compared with 35%). In addition, as in the other two categories, victims in this 
category are often aged between 18 and 25 (45%) and are often Nigerian (21%), Guinean (10%) and Sierra 
Leonean (9%). Once again, the vast majority (64%) were nationals of an African country. The police regi-
ons in which a B9 application was made without the victim first using the reflection period most often 
were Haaglanden (12%), Groningen (12%) and Kennemerland (10%).

4.4  B9 applications granted and rejections

4.4.1 Notes to the figures 
This section contains information about victims of human trafficking39 who were granted a B9 permit 
in the period 2007-2011. It also presents the results of a study of the grounds for rejection on the basis 
of case files.

4.4.2 Number of B9 applications granted
The figure below shows the number of victims who were granted a B9 permit in the period 2007-2011 in 
relation to the possible victims of human trafficking registered by CoMensha.

38 Major exploitation cases, in which many victims possessed the same personal characteristics, could 
influence the impression created by these figures, because the total number of victims in the B9 regu-
lation is not very large. To illustrate this point, a major case that might have influenced the statistics 
in this section is a case in which at least 44 Polish workers were exploited in the flower industry in the 
police region of Brabant Zuid-Oost. None of these workers made a B9 application, so this case would 
probably have had an impact on the number of persons in the category ‘Reflection period without B9 
application’. (Written information received from the police region Brabant Zuid-Oost on the basis of 
the information that emerged from the intake interviews with the workers, 30 November 2012). 

39 Because the IND does not make a distinction in its records between victims of human trafficking and 
witnesses, the findings in this section apply to both groups, and the term ́ victims´ is used consistently 
in this sense.

Figure 4.4 Number of B9 applications granted (2007-2011)

The number of B9 permits granted in each of the years between 2007 and 2011 was as follows: 143 (2007); 
235 (2008); 280 (2009); 340 (2010); and 398 (2011). In other words, almost three times as many B9 permits 
were granted in 2011 than in 2007, with the number of permits granted rising by an average of least 17% 
a year between 2007 and 2011. The substantial increase in the number of non-Dutch possible victims 
registered by CoMensha in 2011 compared with 2010 (up by 23% from 993 to 1,222 registered victims)40 
is not directly reflected in a similar increase in the number of B9 permits granted (which rose by 17%, 
from 340 to 398).

Victims who received a B9 residence permit in the period 2007-2011 often shared the following personal 
characteristics: they were often female (83%), aged between 18 and 25 (46%) and with Nigerian (25%), 
Sierra Leonean (9%) or Chinese (8%) nationality. The majority (67%) of the victims granted a B9 residence 
permit were nationals of an African country. The police regions from which a B9 application was submit-
ted and led to a B9 residence permit being granted most often were Haaglanden (14%), Kennemerland 
(10%) and Groningen (9%).

4.4.3 Rejections of B9 applications
There has been an increase in the number of initial rejections of B9 applications.41 This increase is note-
worthy because there are only a limited number of grounds on which a B9 application can be rejected.

40 See Chapter 3.
41 In other words, not after an objection or appeal.

Victims and the B9 regulation in the Netherlands
57

Article 16 of the Aliens Act stipulates the grounds for rejection of a B9 application, as well as the specific 
exceptions to those grounds for victims of human trafficking. These grounds were already mentioned 
in §4.2.1. One ground for rejection of a B9 application is a threat to public order, provided the breach of 
public order is not connected with the individual’s status as a victim of human trafficking.42

If the breach of public order is directly connected with human trafficking, in derogation from the general 
conditions set out in Article 16 of the Aliens Act, the B9 application may not be rejected.43 However, in 
the Seventh report, the National Rapporteur recommended that even if the victim’s criminal antece-
dents are not related to human trafficking, the interests of protecting the victim (assistance and shelter) 
together with the interests of the criminal investigation should weigh more heavily than the interests 
of immigration law.44

The following table provides an overview of the B9 applications that did not ultimately lead to a B9 
permit in the period 2009-2011.

45 The B9 applications that were rejected for other reasons are not included in the figure. One case in-

volved one person in 2010 who withdrew the application for unknown reasons, and another concerned 
four persons in 2011, which reportedly involved an incorrect entry.  In other words, these were four 
initial B9 applications in 2011 that were ‘notionally rejected’ (2) or ‘no longer being handled’ (2). These 
are administrative steps taken to conclude the procedure when it is not possible to refer to an actual 
B9 application (for example, due to the absence of the official form to apply for the B9 regulation, the 
M55 form) (verbal information from the IND, 24 April 2012).

Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
58

This section focuses on B9 applications that were rejected. As the table shows, there has been an increase 
in the number of B9 applications that were not granted (31 during the period 2009-2011). The IND’s case 
files were studied to discover the grounds for rejection.

Grounds for rejection of B9 applications (2009-2011)
Figure 4.5 shows the three main grounds for rejection of B9 applications in the period 2009-2011 (N: 31).

Figure 4.5 Three main grounds of rejection (total for 2009-2011)

Over the entire period 2009-2011, the largest number (45%, =14) of the unsuccessful B9 applications were 
rejected on the grounds of Article 16.1 of the Aliens Act for a breach of public policy. If, in the opinion 
of the minister, a previous criminal offence is directly connected with human trafficking, the B9 ap-
plication cannot be rejected.46 The rejections discussed here therefore relate to criminal offences that 
the minister felt were not related to human trafficking. In most cases, the offence was shoplifting (6), 
but the offences also included violent offences and/or drug-related offences (4), giving a false identity 
(2), the illegal letting of rooms (1) and killing one’s own daughter (1). A number of the cases involved a 
combination of violations of public policy.47

46 Section 2 of the B9 regulation, under ad. c.
47 In at least three cases, there was evidently a combination of the following offences: illegal letting of 

rooms and giving a false identity; a drug-related offence and use of a false document; shoplifting and 
giving a false identity.

Victims and the B9 regulation in the Netherlands
59

The dilemma with regard to granting a B9 permit to a victim of human trafficking who has also commit-
ted a crime, whether or not it is related to the human trafficking offence, is understandable. However, 
the basic principle of the B9 regulation is the person’s status as a victim and his or her cooperation with 
an investigation and prosecution. Accordingly, in a decision on whether to grant B9 residence status, 
the fact that a person is a victim should prevail over criminal antecedents.48

The majority of those whose B9 applications were rejected (61%, =19) filed an objection (or an appeal). 
The objections (or appeals) of seven (37%) of those nineteen persons were upheld and they received a 
B9 permit retrospectively.49

48 See also National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2009, recommendation 5.
49 The reason for upholding the objection or the appeal was often not clear from the case file. Sometimes 

it was found that, on reflection, the criminal antecedents were connected with human trafficking.

5  Police investigation of suspects in the 
Netherlands

An important element of efforts to tackle human trafficking is the investigation, prosecution and trial 
of suspects. This chapter discusses the investigation phase and is a summary of Chapter 5 in the Dutch 
report Mensenhandel in en uit beeld1, which was published in December 2012. Chapter 6 discusses the pro-
secution and trial of suspects and summarises Chapter 6 of Mensenhandel in en uit beeld2.

In chapters 5 and 6, human trafficking investigations refer to situations that might have involved multi-
ple suspects and/or victims (police investigations). Human trafficking cases refer to individual suspects 
(cases prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS)), see Chapter 6).

5.1 Introduction

The scale of registered human trafficking
Human trafficking is usually hidden. Because victims are often unwilling or do not dare to come forward3 

– or do not realise that they are victims4 – there is likely to be a large ‘dark number’ in police and PPS 
statistics.5 The number of human trafficking situations known to the police and the PPS depends to a 
large extent on factors such as the public awareness of human trafficking, the priorities that have been 
set and the capacity committed to it by investigative agencies and the PPS (the principle of ‘the more

2 Nationaal Rapporteur Mensenhandel 2012f, Chapter 6.
3 Due to fear or a sense of shame or guilt. For non-Dutch victims, additional factors can be difficulty 

speaking the language and/or ignorance of where they can turn to in the Netherlands. Moreover, vic-
tims who are living illegally in the Netherlands sometimes fear the police because they are afraid of 
being deported. In some cases, victims also have debts (real or otherwise) that they must repay to the 
human trafficker (or feel they have to repay), while non-Dutch victims often feel an obligation to send 
money home on a regular basis.

4 For example, victims who have feelings of love towards their trafficker, or non-Dutch victims who 
prefer the situation of exploitation in the Netherlands to the situation in their own country.

5 The victims who do not come forward themselves for the reasons given above (see the previous foo-
tnotes), are only known about if they are identified by others (for example, the police). In the case of 
human trafficking, these victims are often in denial.

you look, the more you will find’), the method of registration by the relevant agencies and changes in 
legislation.6 Changes in the scale of human trafficking that emerge from the police and PPS statistics are 
therefore usually the result of changes in these factors. In other words, they are not usually a reflection 
of an actual change in the scale of the phenomenon of human trafficking. 

Figure 5.1 summarises the statistics that are covered in this chapter and Chapter 6: the figures do not 
relate to the total number of human traffickers (1), but, in this Chapter, to the far smaller group of sus-
pects of human trafficking known to the police (2), and, in Chapter 6, to the group of suspects of human 
trafficking registered by the PPS (3), who have been indicted for human trafficking by the PPS (4) and 
who have been convicted of human trafficking in first instance (5).

number of human traffickers is unknown (dark number). The figure is only intended to illustrate that 
at each step in the process, there are fewer human traffickers.

Police investigation of suspects in the Netherlands
63

The nature of registered human traffickers
The number of suspects known to the police (Figure 5.1, number 2) cannot be regarded as a representa-
tive sample of the total number of human traffickers (number 1 in Figure 5.1). What this means is that 
the number of human traffickers that come to the attention of the police is probably not an accurate 
reflection of the actual number. The reasons why a human trafficker comes to the attention of the police 
are not random, which means that some human traffickers face a greater risk of becoming known to 
the police than others. (It could be connected with the human trafficker’s modus operandus, for example, 
but also due to factors such as the knowledge possessed by investigative agencies and the priorities they 
set with regard to different forms of exploitation and where it occurs.) Moreover, there are possibly per-
sons who are known to the police as suspects of human trafficking (or have been convicted of human 
trafficking by the courts of first instance), who are in reality not human traffickers (see the blue arrows 
in Figure 5.1). In other words, no pronouncements can be made about human traffickers in general on 
the basis of the figures in this chapter and in Chapter 6, but only about suspects and persons who have 
been convicted of human trafficking.

The human traffickers known to the police (Figure 5.1, number 2)
Because the Dutch police records on human trafficking do not provide reliable figures, it is impossible 
to gain a clear impression from those records of the number of human traffickers known to the police.8 
For this reason, the Bureau of the National Rapporteur conducted a study into all 55 police investigations 
of human trafficking (both sexual and other forms of exploitation) that were completed and sent to the 
PPS for prosecution in 2009.9 Those 55 investigations represent only a portion of all the investigations 
that were completed by the police in 2009. They do not cover the human trafficking investigations that 
were ultimately halted because of insufficient evidence or the absence of further leads to investigate, for 
example. It is also not known how representative the investigations in 2009 are for human trafficking 
investigations in general, since a specific focus or priority on the part of the police, or the coincidental 
conduct of an unusually large or specific investigation (an outlier), in a particular year can greatly in-
fluence the impression created by the police investigations in that year (particularly because the total 
number of police investigations is small). 

After gathering the necessary information about the 55 investigations (on the basis of interviews conducted 
in person or by telephone or a study of the case file), the results were analysed in order to accomplish the 
objective of the Bureau of the National Rapporteur’s police investigation study, which was to provide insight 
into the methods by which human trafficking is committed, by whom, and what types of victims are involved 
(see §5.2). Using statistical analysis, the police investigations were then broken down according to various 
types of human trafficking structures (see §5.3).

8 This is the case with respect to the (alleged) human traffickers who are registered by the PPS for 
prosecution for human trafficking (see Chapter 6).

9 The survey encompassed police investigations by all of the agencies that can carry out investigations of 
human trafficking, these being 25 police forces, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the Royal 
Netherlands Marechaussee and the Social Intelligence and Investigation Service (with effect from 1 
January 2012, the Labour Inspectorate, the Work and Income Inspectorate and the Social Intelligence 
and Investigation Service were merged into the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Em-
ployment. Compared with other years, the 55 police investigations completed and sent to the PPS in 
2009 was in fact a very small number. 



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
64

5.2 The police investigation study 2009, part I

5.2.1 The 55 police investigations
The 55 police investigations that were analysed covered 46 investigations (84%) solely involving sexual 
exploitation, five investigations (9%) solely involving other forms of exploitation and four investigations 
(7%) involving both sexual and other forms of exploitation. 

Police investigations of sexual exploitation
The sexual exploitation occurred (at least in part) in window prostitution (63%), clubs (28%), escort agen-
cies (26%), private homes (11%), brothels (7%) and, in one case, partly on the street. In at least a fifth of 
the 46 investigations (20%, = 9) solely involving sexual exploitation, victims who were put to work were 
moved around between the Netherlands and other countries (particularly Belgium). 

Criminal connections
As far as the police could tell, human trafficking was the ‘main criminal activity’ of the suspects in practi-
cally every investigation they conducted. However, they were sometimes also engaged in ‘ancillary crimi-
nal activities’, particularly drug dealing, the possession and sale of weapons and money laundering. The 
police said that in 36 of the sexual exploitation investigations they were aware of cooperation between 
suspects – twelve cases (33%) reportedly involved a criminal organisation consisting of more than two 
persons. This was also the case for all five investigations into other forms of exploitation and for three 
of the four investigations into both sexual and other forms of exploitation, bringing the total to twenty 
criminal organisations. The police were also asked to describe the relationships between the suspects in 
these organisations. Replies were received in seventeen cases. It is noteworthy that in these seventeen 
investigations, the relationships between the suspects were more often ‘informal’ (94%) (mainly through 
friendship10) than ‘formal’ (24%, based at least in part on a business relationship).11 

Relationship between recruiters and victims
Table 5.1 shows the relationship between the victims and the persons who recruited them (who were 
not always the principal suspects in the police investigations). As the table shows, different types of 
relationships are almost always found in an investigation, firstly because there are often various victims 
within an investigation who might have different relationships with a particular recruiter, and secondly, 
because there can be more than one recruiter in a case that is being investigated.

10 But also on the basis of a family or partner relationship.
11 In thirteen police investigations, there was only an informal relationship; in three investigations, both 

a formal and an informal relationship; and in one investigation, only a formal relationship.

In 41% of the police investigations of sexual exploitation, the victims were recruited by friends or ac-
quaintances, and almost equally often on the basis of a purported (feigned) loving relationship. In 28% 
of the investigations, the victims were already working as prostitutes before they were recruited by a 
person in the prostitution world, and in a fifth of the investigations of sexual exploitation, the recruiters 
and victims were strangers to each other. In the investigations into other forms of exploitation, victims 
were generally recruited by means of a purported (feigned) loving relationship or by persons not known 
to them.

5.2.2 The 133 suspects
The 55 police investigations encompassed a total of 133 suspects: 103 (77%) were suspected exclusively of 
sexual exploitation, twenty (15%) exclusively of other forms of exploitation and ten (8%) of both sexual 
and other forms of exploitation. On average, there were two to three suspects in each investigation. 
The average number of suspects was larger (four) in the investigations of other forms of exploitation 
than investigations of sexual exploitation. For more information about the personal characteristics of 
suspects of human trafficking, see §6.4.

12 Victims were already working as prostitutes.
13 Victim and recruiter did not know each other.
14 The police said that the relationship consisted of ‘poverty’ (this might have meant that the nature of 

the relationship was ‘geographical’ – that they both came from the same ‘poor’ region).
15 In one case, the police said that the nature of the relationship was ‘geographic’ (they came from the 

same region) and in another that the relationship was that of employer/employee.



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
66

Personal characteristics of suspects
The gender of 107 suspects is known: 77% (=82) were male and 23% (=25) were female. Of the 111 suspects 
whose age is known, 40% (=44) were younger than 26 (a few of whom (= 4) were minors) and 14% (=16) 
were older than 40. The suspects of sexual exploitation were significantly younger (29 years), on average, 
than suspects of other forms of exploitation (36.4 years).16 The country of birth of 123 of the suspects 
is known. More than a third (37%, =46) were born in Central and Eastern Europe, more than a quarter 
(27%, =33) in the Netherlands and 17% (=21) in the group of countries ‘Turkey, Morocco, Surinam and the 
former Netherlands Antilles’. In the police investigations of sexual exploitation, significantly more of the 
suspects were born in Central and Eastern Europe (45%) than among suspects of other forms of exploi-
tation or of both sexual and other forms of exploitation (less than 1%).17 The country of birth does not 
always correspond with the nationality of the suspects, however. Of the 120 suspects whose nationality 
was known to the police, 43% (=52) had Dutch nationality, and these Dutch suspects were, on average, 
significantly older (32.6 years)18 than suspects of other nationalities (27.6 years).19,20

The role of suspects in the human trafficking process
Table 5.2 shows the roles that suspects played in the human trafficking process. Suspects often perfor-
med more than one role.

For 106 (133–27) of the suspects, the role they played in the human trafficking process was clear. A third 
of them (36, =34%) performed one specific role; mainly that of pimp.21 In the police investigations of 
sexual exploitation, the most common combinations of roles were the following: pimp, recruiter and 
bodyguard (thirteen times), and recruiter and pimp (eleven times).

The following section contains an analysis of differences between the personal characteristics (gender, 
age, region of birth and whether they had a legal income and criminal antecedents) of the suspects who 
performed specific roles in the human trafficking process (recruiter, transporter, pimp, bodyguard, sex 
business operator and driver) and those of suspects who did not perform those roles. Because the roles 
listed in Table 5.2 relate mainly to sexual exploitation (more than half of the suspects of other forms 
of exploitation performed a role that falls into the category ‘Other’), this analysis has only been made 
for the suspects of sexual exploitation (N: 103) and for the suspects of both sexual and other forms of 

22 Transporter of victims from another country to the Netherlands (or vice versa).
23 Person who controlled victims.
24 It is not clear what businesses were run by the seven suspects of human trafficking who played the 

role of sex business operator in the human trafficking process. In the police investigations where the 
sex business operators were involved, the work was performed in escort agencies (two investigations 
involved only employment in an escort service), in clubs, in window prostitution (one investigation 
involve solely employment in window prostitution), in massage parlours and in work in the home.

25 A regular driver for victims (bringing them to and from the workplace).
26 One provided accommodation, one was a facilitator (arranged documents) and one benefited from the 

exploitation.
27 Five were organisers, three facilitators (not further specified), one a forger, one arranged false docu-

ments and one was a mediator.
28 One was a money mule/straw man and one was a bookkeeper.

exploitation (N: 10). The information below is therefore based on a total of 11329 suspects of at least sexual 
exploitation.

Recruiters
Recruiters were predominantly male (74%), with an average age of 28.6 years30 – neither characteristic 
differs significantly from the gender or age of suspects who did not perform the role of recruiter. The 
largest group (40%) of the recruiters were born in Central and Eastern Europe, as were the other suspects. 
There were significantly fewer recruiters who were born in Asia (2% of recruiters) than suspects who only 
performed other roles in the human trafficking process (14% of the other suspects).31 This could imply 
that the Dutch police identified the entire criminal organisation less often in police investigations into 
human trafficking with an Asian component (specifically, identified fewer of the Asian recruiters).32 
Otherwise, the recruiters did not differ significantly from the other suspects with regard to having a legal 
income (30% of the recruiters) or having criminal antecedents (57% of the recruiters).

Transporters
Transporters did not differ significantly from the other categories of suspects in terms of gender (68% 
of the transporters were male), age (their average age was 32.6)33 and region of birth (53% were born in 
Central and Eastern Europe and 7% in Asia and Africa). Because the role of transporters, by definition, 
implies transnational human trafficking, the study also reviewed the regions of birth of the suspects 
who, in relative terms, performed this role most often and least often. It was found that 50% of the sus-
pects who performed the role of transporter were born in Africa, and more than a third (35%) were born 
in Central and Eastern Europe. Suspects born in ‘Turkey, Morocco, Surinam or the former Netherlands 
Antilles’ performed this role least often in relative terms (17%). This could create the impression that 
the latter group of suspects are involved less often in transnational human trafficking – although the 
differences mentioned are not significant. There was no significant difference between transporters and 
other suspect as regards having a legal income (23% of the transporters) or criminal antecedents (43% 
of the transporters).

29 The suspects whose relevant personal characteristics were not known are disregarded here, so the 
numbers involved are as follows: the suspects of at least sexual exploitation whose gender is known 
(N: 96), the suspects of at least sexual exploitation whose age is known (N: 97), the suspects of at least 
sexual exploitation whose country of birth is known (N: 106), the suspects of at least sexual exploitation 
whom the police knew to have legal work/income (N: 113) and the suspects of at least sexual exploita-
tion whom the police knew to have criminal antecedents (N: 113).

32 However, there are other equally possible explanations. For example, Asian human traffickers might 

simply play the role of recruiter less often and use a human trafficker who was not born in Asia for this 
‘task’ in the human trafficking process. Or ‘the recruiting’ by human traffickers born in Asia is con-
fined to a relatively small proportion of the human traffickers involved. An Asian recruiter would then 
recruit relatively more victims than a non-Asian recruiter (and might be involved in several criminal 
organisations that are engaged in human trafficking).

33 N: 26; SD: 11.5 years.

Pimps
Pimps are significantly more often male than suspects who do not perform this role (84% of pimps, 
compared to 62% of other suspects).34 There is no significant difference compared with other suspects 
with regard to age (the average age of pimps is 29.3 years)35 and region of birth (44% were born in Central 
and Eastern Europe and 4% in Africa). Pimps also do not differ significantly from other suspects in terms 
of having a legal income (30% of pimps), but they do have criminal antecedents significantly more often 
than other suspects (58%, compared to 29%).36

Bodyguards
Bodyguards do not differ significantly from the suspects who only perform other roles in terms of gender 
(76% of bodyguards are male), but they are, on average, significantly younger (27.2 years)37 than other 
suspects (30.8 years).38,39 This could suggest that the tasks associated with the role of a bodyguard (con-
trolling victims) are delegated mainly to ‘starting human traffickers’. Like the suspects who do not play the 
role of bodyguard, the largest group of bodyguards (49%) were born in Central and Eastern Europe and 
the smallest group (6%) were born in Africa. Bodyguards did not differ significantly from other suspects 
in terms of having a legal income (37%) or criminal antecedents (51%).

Sex business operators
The proportion of operators of a sex business that were male (67%) did not differ significantly from sus-
pects who did not perform that role. On average, however, sex business operators were significantly older 
(42.5 years)40 than suspects who exclusively performed other roles (28.7 years).41,42 This could imply that 
the role of ‘sex business operator’ is reserved mainly for the ‘more experienced human trafficker’.43 In 
contrast to the other suspects, the largest group (43%) of sex business operators were born in the Nether-
lands (rather than in Central and Eastern Europe), but the difference does not appear to be significant. As 
with the other suspects, the smallest group (in fact 0%) of sex business operators were born in Africa. Sex 
business operators did not differ significantly from the other suspects in terms of having a legal income 
(14% of the operators)44 or criminal antecedents (43% of the operators).

43 In fact, it is also possible that human traffickers who perform the role of sex business operator only 

become involved in human trafficking at a later age. In other words, this is not necessarily an indication 
that an individual is an ‘experienced human trafficker’ – that depends on the age at which the suspects 
became engaged in human trafficking and, unfortunately, that information is not available. 

44 The sex business within which the human trafficking occurred was probably not regarded as legal work/
income by the police (possibly because human trafficking was occurring within the business). It is also 
possible that the sex business was an illegal enterprise.

Drivers
Drivers did not differ significantly from other suspects in terms of gender (73% of drivers were male), age 
(their average age was 33.3)45 or region of birth (54% of drivers were born in Central and Eastern Europe 
and 0% in Africa). They also did not differ significantly from suspect who did not perform the role of driver 
as regards having legal work/income (39%) or criminal antecedents (39%).

5.2.3 157 victims
The 55 police investigations encompassed a total of 263 victims. In one investigation of exploitation out-
side the sex industry, there were 106 victims (mainly adult female victims of Indonesian and Philippine 
origin). That investigation is an outlier and would have too great an influence on the average picture, so 
these victims are disregarded in this section. This section is therefore devoted to 157 victims in 54 inves-
tigations. There were 119 victims (76%) of only sexual exploitation, 10 victims (6%) of only other forms 
of exploitation and 28 victims (18%) of both sexual and other forms of exploitation. The average number 
of victims per investigation was almost three. With the exception of the investigation into exploitation 
outside the sex industry with 106 victims, the differences between the investigations of sexual and other 
forms of exploitation in terms of the average number of victims were very small. For more detailed infor-
mation about the personal characteristics of victims of human trafficking, see Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.

Personal characteristics of victims
Almost all of the victims in the police investigations of sexual exploitation were female (at least 97% of 
the 119 victims of only sexual exploitation and at least 79% of the 28 victims of both sexual and other 
forms of exploitation), while the majority of the victims of other forms of exploitation were male (at 
least 60% of the ten victims of exclusively other forms of exploitation). At least 4% (=7) of all victims were 
below the age of sixteen at the time the human trafficking offence commenced – these were all victims 
of sexual exploitation (one of whom was also a victim of other forms of exploitation). At least 15% (=18) 
of the victims of sexual exploitation were minors. Almost the same percentage of victims of sexual ex-
ploitation (14%,=17) were precisely eighteen years of age (the age at which voluntary prostitution is legal 
in the Netherlands) and at least a fifth were aged nineteen or twenty. More than a fifth of the victims 
came from the Netherlands and more than half (52%) from Central and Eastern European countries. 
The victims from Central and Eastern Europe appeared almost exclusively in the investigations of sexual 
exploitation and occasionally in the investigations into both sexual and other forms of exploitation. 
The majority of the victims involved in the police investigations into other forms of exploitation and 
the investigations into both sexual and other forms of exploitation came from Asia. This distribution of 
victims by region of origin is similar to the distribution of suspects by region of birth.

Victims and duration of exploitation
Table 5.3 shows that, on average, the victims were exploited for more than a year (12.3 months). The 
shortest period was four days and the longest more than eight years. On average, the victims of both 
sexual and other forms of exploitation were exploited for significantly longer periods than victims of 

45 N: 12; SD: 11.1 years.

5.3  The police investigation study 2009, part II: different human trafficking 
structures

A statistical analysis (cluster analysis) was performed to break down the 55 police investigations into 
groups that were as different as possible (heterogeneity) and which displayed the greatest possible simi-
larities (homogeneity). This analysis produced the three following types of human trafficking structures:
1) Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation (N: 27);
2) European sexual exploitation (N: 22);
3) International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry (N: 6).

The factors that were relevant in establishing the three structures are explained in §5.3.1, and the structu-
res are then described and illustrated on the basis of a case study in §5.3.2. Not every police investigation 
that falls within a particular human trafficking structure will correspond with every aspect of the descrip-
tion of that structure. For example, cases of ‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’ occasionally also 
involve other forms of exploitation; similarly, cases of ‘International large-scale exploitation outside 
the sex industry’ occasionally also involve sexual exploitation. Finally, the similarities and differences 
between the three structures are explained in §5.3.3.

5.3.2 The three human trafficking structures

1) Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation (N: 27)
Within this human trafficking structure, there were an average of 1.8 suspects and 1.6 victims per police 
investigation. Only 11% of the investigations also involved female suspects, and the average age of the 
oldest suspect was 31.6 years. The suspects were frequently born in ‘Turkey, Morocco, Surinam or the 
former Netherlands Antilles’ (in 52% of the investigations, at least one suspect was born in one of those 

61 In 23% of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’, victims 
were moved around within the Netherlands and in 32% of the investigations falling under the heading 
‘European sexual exploitation’, victims were moved around between the Netherlands and other coun-
tries, compared with 4% and 7%, respectively (‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’) and 17% and 
17%, respectively (‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’). 

62 In none of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’ was there 
a male victim, compared with 11% (‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’) and 33% (‘International 
large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

63 In 32% of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’, at least 
one victim made an exculpatory statement, compared with 7% (‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploita-
tion’) and no victims (‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

64 In 59% of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’, at least 
one suspect had criminal antecedents, compared with 82% (‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’) 
and 33% (‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

65 On average, the youngest victim in a police investigation falling under the heading ‘European sexual ex-
ploitation’ was 20.4 years (with a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 37 years; SD: 5.2 years), compared 
with 20.3 years (with a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 31 years; SD: 4.3 years) (‘Domestic small-scale 
sexual exploitation’) and 26.7 years (with a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 45 years; SD: 11.7 years) 
(‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

66 In 32% of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’, at least 
one victim had personally committed criminal offences, compared with 19% (‘Domestic small-scale 
sexual exploitation’) and 17% (‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

67 In 41% of the police investigations falling under the heading ‘European sexual exploitation’, the sus-
pects were also engaged in other criminal activities in addition to human trafficking, compared with 
33% (‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’) and 33% (‘International large-scale exploitation out-
side the sex industry’).

68 The average age of the youngest suspect in a police investigation falling under the heading ‘European 
sexual exploitation was 25.8 years (with a minimum of 17 and a maximum of 35 years; SD: 5.7 years), 
compared with 26.2 years (with a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 46 years; SD: 7,1 years) (‘Domestic 
small-scale sexual exploitation’) and 26.2 years (with a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 40 years; SD: 
9,4 years) (‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’).

countries) or in the Netherlands (in 44% of the investigations at least one suspect was born in this 
country), and the victims were mainly from the Netherlands (in 70% of the investigations, at least one 
victim came from this country). In almost every case, the victims were exploited in the sex industry; oc-
casionally they were also exploited in other sectors. In more than half of the investigations (56%), there 
was a (feigned) loving relationship between a recruiter and a victim.

A case of Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation
This police investigation was based on warnings given to the police by the parents of the victim, 
who was a 25-year-old Dutch woman, who did not want to cooperate with the police investigation. 
Her boyfriend (the suspect), with whom the victim was living, was a Dutch national aged around 
30. He was born in Morocco and had criminal antecedents (not human trafficking). The suspect had 
accumulated debts that had to be repaid and he used his (feigned) loving relationship to persuade 
his girlfriend (the victim) to work as a prostitute to pay them off. The suspect acted as her pimp 
and she worked for him in clubs in the Netherlands. The suspect himself earned undeclared income 
working as a painter. As far as the police were aware, apart from human trafficking, the suspect 
was not engaged in any other criminal activities, nor was the victim involved in the commission 
of criminal offences.

2) European sexual exploitation (N: 22)
Within this human trafficking structure, there were an average of 2.8 suspects and 3.6 victims involved in 
each investigation. Almost half of the investigations (41%) also involved female suspects, and the average 
age of the oldest suspects per investigation was 34.0 years. Almost all of the suspects had been born in 
Central and Eastern Europe (in 96% of the police investigations, at least one suspect had been born there) 
and the victims were also mainly from this region (at least one victim in every investigation was from 
there). In every case, the victims were exploited exclusively in the sex industry. In almost a quarter of the 
police investigations (23%), there was a (feigned) loving relationship between a recruiter and a victim.

A case of European sexual exploitation
This police investigation was based on information from the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU). Three 
suspects, who had been born in Bulgaria, were arrested. One was a 28-year-old man, who played 
the role of both recruiter and pimp; another was a 29-year-old woman, who also played the role 
of both recruiter and pimp; and there was a 23-year-old male suspect, who only played the role of 
pimp. None of the suspects had legal income from work or received benefits and the police did not 
know whether any of them had criminal antecedents. The suspects were engaged exclusively in hu-
man trafficking; any other offences were committed in furtherance of the human trafficking. There 
were three female victims: a 17-year-old Bulgarian woman, who made an exculpatory statement; 
a 29-year-old Bulgarian woman, who had been exploited for 36 months and had reported the 
offence and/or made an incriminating statement; and a 31-year-old Hungarian woman, who had 
been exploited for eight months and had also reported the offence and/or made an incriminating 
statement. The victims were recruited in their countries of origin and at least one of the victims 
was in a (feigned) loving relationship with her recruiter. The victims were moved around within the 
Netherlands and between the Netherlands and other countries (Germany and Switzerland). In the 
Netherlands, they worked in window prostitution, brothels, clubs and escort agencies. Their pas-
sports and the money they earned were confiscated by the suspects, who used threats and physical 
and sexual violence against them, as well as threats of violence against the families of the victims.

The victims stayed in a hotel or guesthouse or slept in the work place. At least one victim was also 
involved in committing human trafficking.

3) International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry (N: 6)
Within this human trafficking structure, there were an average of 4.0 suspects and 32.2 victims in each 
police investigation. A large majority of the investigations (83%) also involved female suspects, and the 
average age of the oldest suspects per investigation was 46.3 years. The suspects had mainly been born 
in Asia (at least one suspect in every investigation) or in the Netherlands (at least one suspect in 83% of 
the investigations), and the victims came mainly from Asia (at least one victim in every investigation). 
In almost every case, the victims were exploited at least in part outside the sex industry. There was no 
(feigned) loving relationship between a recruiter and a victim in any investigation.

A case of International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry
This investigation was also based on information from the CIU and reports received by Stichting 
M. (an independent organisation that runs a free hotline where people can anonymously provide 
information about crime, including human trafficking) and passed on to public and private part-
ners, including the police. The case involved exploitation in the food industry. The police found 
more than ten illegal aliens living in a house, which was also their work place, where they prepared 
food. Four of the victims, males from Indonesia aged between 26 and 61, were ultimately willing to 
report an offence as victims of human trafficking. They had been exploited for periods ranging from 
one to four months and had been recruited in cities in Indonesia. The recruiters and the victims 
were not known to each other. False promises had been made to the victims, and their vulnerable 
position had been abused. The victims had signed up for the trip voluntarily and had paid heavily 
for it. Six suspects were arrested in all. The principal suspect was a 45-year-old Dutch man, who 
was claiming benefits. His partner (a 37-year-old Dutch woman with a secondary education and 
with her own business) was also involved in the exploitation, as were his daughter (a 25-year-old 
Dutch woman with a higher education, who had an administrative job and provided accommo-
dation in the human trafficking process), his son-in-law (a 38-year-old Dutch national, who was 
born in Surinam, who was employed as a civil servant and who also provided accommodation in 
the human trafficking process), and his lover (a 29-year-old Indonesian woman, who worked in the 
home-care sector and helped in the human trafficking process by arranging the victims’ journey 
from Indonesia to the Netherlands). A 38-year-old Indonesian man, the principal suspect’s fore-
man, was also regarded as a suspect in the investigation. The police were not aware of any criminal 
antecedents for any of the six suspects. The police identified the entire criminal organisation, and 
in addition to human trafficking, the suspects were also involved in other criminal activities, such 
as people smuggling and money laundering. The relationship between the suspects was mainly 
informal (based on family ties).

5.3.3  Differences and similarities between the three human trafficking 
structures

Differences
In contrast to suspects in cases of ‘European sexual exploitation’ (who are mainly from Central and Eas-
tern Europe) and ‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’’ (mainly from Asia and 
the Netherlands), the suspects in cases of ‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation’ were born mainly 
in ‘Turkey, Morocco, Surinam or the former Netherlands Antilles’ or in the Netherlands. The suspects

in this structure are least often female (compared to suspects of ‘International large-scale exploitation 
outside the sex industry’, who are most often female). On average, the oldest suspects in cases of ‘Euro-
pean sexual exploitation’ are the youngest of the three structures (the oldest suspects of ‘International 
large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’ are the oldest) and the suspects do not operate in a 
criminal organisation, or if they do, it is in a far smaller organisation than the suspects of the other two 
human trafficking structures (suspects in ‘International large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’ 
operate in the largest criminal organisations). 

In contrast to the victims of the other two human trafficking structures, the victims of ‘Domestic small-
scale sexual exploitation’ come mainly from the Netherlands (in the case of ‘European sexual exploita-
tion’, victims are mainly from Central and Eastern Europe and with regard to ‘International large-scale 
exploitation outside the sex industry’, they are mainly from Asia). In contrast to ‘International large-scale 
exploitation outside the sex industry’, exploitation in the category ‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploi-
tation’ occurs primarily in the sex industry, but occasionally also outside it (which is never the case with 
‘European sexual exploitation’). The number of victims in each human trafficking situation is smallest 
in the case of ‘Domestic small-scale sexual exploitation (the number of victims in cases of ‘International 
large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry’ is the largest) and the victims are recruited most often 
by means of a (feigned) loving relationship (which is never the case with ‘International large-scale ex-
ploitation outside the sex industry’). This latter aspect shows that the method of recruiting on the basis 
of a (feigned) loving relationship (which is also related to the ‘lover boy method’) is not confined to a 
particular human trafficking structure (and is also not always used by all recruiters within a structure), 
but it is related mainly to sexual exploitation on a smaller scale. However, classifying human trafficking 
situations solely on the grounds of this recruiting method would not adequately reflect the nature of 
different types of human trafficking situations.

Similarities
It is noteworthy that, although the regions of origin differ between the three structures, within each 
structure the regions of origin of the suspects and the victims are the same. Other noteworthy findings 
were that there were scarcely any differences between the structures in terms of the ages of the youngest 
suspects in each police investigation (which could indicate ‘starting’ human traffickers), whether the 
suspects had committed other offences in addition to human trafficking, the involvement of victims in 
the commission of criminal offences and the ages of the youngest victims in each investigation (which 
could indicate the age at which they were recruited). 





6  Prosecution and trial of suspects in the 
Netherlands

Following the discussion of investigations in Chapter 5, this chapter focuses on the phases of prose-
cution and trial. It is a summary of Chapter 6 in the Dutch report Mensenhandel in en uit beeld1 that was 
published in December 2012.2 

6.1 Introduction

This chapter presents the results of an analysis of the national database of the Public Prosecution Service 
(PPS), which contains information from the district offices and district courts, including annual statistics 
on the prosecution and trial of human trafficking.3 Unfortunately, because of how Article 273f of the 
Dutch Criminal Code is drafted, it is impossible to make a distinction between exploitation within the 
sex industry (sexual exploitation), exploitation in other economic sectors (other forms of exploitation) 
and exploitation for the purpose of organ removal on the grounds of the sections and subsections. 

This chapter deals only with the prosecution and trial of suspects who have been registered by the PPS on 
suspicion of human trafficking4 because the PPS data on cases registered for prosecution can probably 
not be regarded as representative of the actual occurrence of human trafficking (for a more detailed 
explanation, see §5.1 and Figure 5.1).

 

1 Nationaal Rapporteur Mensenhandel 2012f, Chapter 6.
2 In Chapters 5 and 6, ‘human trafficking investigations’ refers to police investigations of human 

trafficking situations where multiple suspects and/or victims might be involved. ‘Human trafficking 
cases’ refers to individual suspects (cases prosecuted by the PPS).

3 It is possible to select the cases in which at least the offence of human trafficking is registered (Articles 
250a (old), 250ter (old), 273a (old) 29 or 273f DCC) from the complete PPS database. The secondary 
analyses of the ‘human trafficking’ subset were performed, at the request of the Bureau of the National 
Rapporteur, by the Statistical Information and Policy Analysis (SIBA) department of the Ministry of 
Justice’s Centre for Research and Documentation (WODC).

by the Bureau of the National Rapporteur (National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d).

80

The data in §6.2 on the prosecution of the human trafficking cases registered by the PPS and in §6.3 on 
the trial of human trafficking cases in first instance usually do not encompass a cohort and can therefore 
seldom be compared, since not all cases are dealt with by the PPS and heard by the court of instance in 
the year they are registered by the PPS. §6.4 contains statistics about the personal characteristics of the 
suspects and convicted offenders.

6.2 Prosecution

6.2.1 Human trafficking cases registered by the PPS
In the period 2007-2011, a total of 1,106 human trafficking cases were registered by the PPS. On average, 
this comes to roughly 220 human trafficking cases a year, ranging from 141 cases in 2009 to 281 cases in 
2007. The registered cases are distributed very unevenly over the country’s nineteen different court dis-
tricts: the three districts that heard the most cases together account for 40% of the cases heard, compared 
with a combined 6% for the four districts with the fewest cases. 

6.2.2 Human trafficking cases dealt with by the PPS
The PPS handled a total of 1,103 human cases in the period 2007-2011 – again an average of approximately 
220 a year. The years 2007 and 2008 depart furthest from this average, with 176 and 270 cases, respectively.

Cases dealt with by method of disposition
Figure 6.1 shows how the PPS disposed of the 1,103 human trafficking cases.5

Figure 6.1 Cases dealt with by the PPS, by method of disposition (2007-2011)

Most of the cases dealt with (71%) resulted in a summons for at least human trafficking, and more than 
a fifth (22%) ended in an unconditional decision not to prosecute, mainly on the grounds of non-com-
petence. The proportion of decisions not to prosecute on the grounds of a policy waiver ranged from 
8% in 2010 to 25% in 2009. The PPS will adopt a decision not to prosecute on technical grounds (in

Dutch, technische sepots), for example, if a conviction does not appear likely because there is insufficient 
evidence. If it is decided not to prosecute on grounds based on the public interest, a policy waiver will 
be chosen. These grounds might be related to the offence committed (for example, it is an old offence 
or the suspect played a small part in the offence) or to the suspect personally (the suspect cannot be 
found, for example).

6.2.3 Cases in which the PPS issued a summons for human trafficking 
The trend in the annual share of cases in which summonses were issued for human trafficking is shown 
in Figure 6.1 (the bottom segment of the columns). The PPS issued summonses for at least human traf-
ficking in a total of 784 cases in the period 2007-2011. In an average of 62% of those 784 cases, there were 
aggravating circumstances (in other words, qualified human trafficking), particularly trafficking com-
mitted by two or more persons acting in concert and/or human trafficking involving a victim younger 
than the age of sixteen.

Summons, according to the most serious offence
Because human trafficking is often committed in combination with other offences, a case can also in-
volve a number of other offences. Figure 6.2 provides an overview of the most serious offences recorded 
in the 784 summonses.6 The most ‘serious’ offence is the offence with the heaviest maximum sentence 
– it does not imply a qualitative judgment of the offence.

Figure 6.2 Summonses, by most serious offence (2007-2011)

Human trafficking (unqualified or qualified) was the most serious registered offence for which charges 
were brought in 82% of the cases. Where there was also suspicion of a more serious offence than human 
trafficking, it was generally a form of sexual violence (11% of the total in the five years). This would mainly 
have been offences such as rape or sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16.

In the period from 2007 to 2011, the courts of first instance disposed of 663 human trafficking cases, which 
represent an average of just over 130 cases a years. The three most recent years only diverge by a maximum 
of 4% from this average. The number of cases dealt with each year ranges from 115 in 2007 to 152 in 2008.

On average, only slightly more than half (56%) of the human trafficking cases heard in first instance led 
to a conviction for offences including human trafficking.8 In 38% of all cases heard, defendants were 
acquitted on all the human trafficking offences charged (22% involved acquittal for all human trafficking 
offences, but conviction for offences other than human trafficking, and 16% involved a complete acquit-
tal). Previous statistical reports produced by the National Rapporteur have shown that the percentage of 
convictions for human trafficking declined by no less than 25% in the period 2004 to 2009. In 2010, for 
the first time there was a distinct relative increase to 59%, and the figure remained roughly the same in 
2011 (58%). Despite this recent increase, the proportion of convictions remains low. This shows that it is 
still difficult to secure a conviction for human trafficking. The qualitative analysis in the case law study 
by the Bureau of the National Rapporteur suggests several reasons for this. In that report the National 
Rapporteur recommended that public prosecutors and judges who hear human trafficking cases should 
be specialised in that field.9

6.3.2 Convictions for human trafficking in first instance
The trend in the annual number of convictions for human trafficking in first instance is shown in Figure 6.3 
(middle line); the trend in the percentage of convictions is presented in Figure 6.4 (the bottom segment of the 
columns). The total number of cases in which there were convictions for at least human trafficking in first 
instance was 374 in the period 2007-2011.

Convictions in first instance, by sentence imposed
Figure 6.5 provides an overview of the heaviest principal sentences imposed in 374 cases in which there 
were convictions in any case for human trafficking in first instance.10 The sentences imposed are not 
always handed down exclusively for the proven human trafficking offences. Other offences in addition 
to human trafficking are regularly declared proven, sometimes even offences with a higher maximum 
sentence than human trafficking (in an average 8% of the cases).

8 There could also have been acquittals for human trafficking offences among this 56%, since, if a hu-
man trafficking offence is declared proven there is a conviction for at least human trafficking, but it 
is possible that the suspect was acquitted of other human trafficking offences at the same time. For 
information about ‘full’ and ‘partial’ convictions for human trafficking, see National Rapporteur on 
Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d, p. 37, Table 2.

Figure 6.5 Convictions in first instance, by principal sentence imposed (2007-2011)

In the period shown, on average, in 91% of the human trafficking convictions, the heaviest principal 
sentence imposed was an unconditional or partially conditional custodial sentence, ranging from 84% 
in 2009 to 95% in 2007. A community service sentence was the heaviest principal sentence imposed 
in 1% of cases on average, but was imposed in a total of 13% of cases, including those in which it was 
imposed in combination with a custodial sentence, either unconditional or (partially conditional). On 
four occasions, a fine was imposed in combination with an unconditional or (partially) conditional 
custodial sentence, and in three cases, no principal sentence was imposed at all. The three most com-
mon combinations of principal sentences imposed were an entirely unconditional custodial sentence 
(56%), a partially conditional custodial sentence (27%) and a partially conditional custodial sentence in 
combination with community service (7%).

6.3.3 Custodial sentences imposed for human trafficking in first instance
The trend in the annual number of unconditional or partially conditional custodial sentences imposed 
for human trafficking in first instance is shown in Figure 6.3 (bottom line) and the trend in the percentage 
of custodial sentences imposed is shown in Figure 6.5 (the bottom segment of the columns). The total 
number of cases in the period 2007-2011 in which an unconditional or partially conditional custodial 
sentence was imposed for at least human trafficking in first instance was 341.

Figure 6.6 Custodial sentences imposed in first instance, by category of duration (2007-2011)

In 42% of the cases, the length of the unconditional part of the custodial sentences was not longer than 
one year. Custodial sentences of more than four years were almost never imposed (7% over the five 
years).12 The figure shows that there were relatively more custodial sentences of up to a year in 2009 and 
2010 than in the two preceding years (49%-52% compared with 33%-41%). In the two more recent years, 
custodial sentences of over four years were also imposed more often (8%-9% compared with 4%). In 
2011, a sentence of up to one year was imposed less often (37%) and sentences of more than four years 
were imposed more often (9%). 

The average length of the unconditional part of the custodial sentences ranged from 617.1 days13 in 2010 
to 749.1 days14 in 2011. Earlier statistical publications by the National Rapporteur show that the current 
custodial sentences are shorter than they were formerly (the average in the period 2000-2008 was 759.7 
days,15 and in the period covered here (2007-2011) it was 665.4 days16). However, with the sharp increase 
in the average number of days imposed in 2011 – probably as a result of the increase in the statutory 

12 The qualitative analyses in the case law study by the Bureau of the National Rapporteur show that sen-
tences in similar human trafficking cases vary. In the interests of consistent sentencing, the National 
Rapporteur has recommended formulating orientation points for the judiciary (National Rapporteur 
on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012d, pp. 175-176).

sentences for human trafficking offences committed after July 200917 – the sentences imposed by the 
courts seem to correspond with the seriousness of the offence of human trafficking that the legislature 
wanted to emphasise.

6.4 Characteristics

For the development of the annual number of suspects of human trafficking registered by the PPS, see 
§6.2.1. There was a total of 1,106 suspects in the period 2007-2011. The development in the number of per-
sons who were convicted of human trafficking at first instance every year is shown in Figure 6.3 (middle 
line). The total number of persons convicted during the period 2007-2011 was 374, ranging from 69 per-
sons convicted in 2009 to 79 persons convicted in 2010 (with an average of roughly 75 convictions a year).

6.4.1 Gender, age and country of birth of suspects and convicted offenders
The suspects (N: 1,106) and convicted offenders (N: 374) in the period 2007-2011 were overwhelmingly 
men (82% and 85%, respectively). The average age of the suspects and convicted offenders at the time 
of the first human trafficking offence of which they were suspected was 31.3 years18 and 30.5 years, 
respectively.19,20 Among suspects, the proportion aged up to and including 25 years declined almost 
every year, from 42% in 2007 to 25% in 2011. Among convicted offenders, there was a gradual decline in 
that respect, from 42% in 2007 to 29% in 2010, with a slight increase to 32% observed in 2011. Minors 
accounted for 3% of suspects and 4% of convicted offenders, and roughly a fifth (20% of the suspects and 
18% of the convicted offenders) were older than 40 years. 

17 The Dutch legislature’s current perception of the seriousness of the offence led to the maximum sen-
tences for human trafficking being increased with effect from July 2009 (from six to eight years’ im-
prisonment for unqualified human trafficking, from eight to twelve years for human trafficking by two 
or more persons acting in concert or committed against a person younger than sixteen years, from 
twelve to fifteen years for human trafficking that results in serious physical injury or threatens the life 
of another person and from fifteen to eighteen years for human trafficking resulting in death) (Bulletin 
of Acts, Orders and Decrees. 2009, 245). The higher sentences only apply for offences committed after 
July 2009. The human trafficking cases heard by the courts of first instance in 2009 and 2010 usually 
related to human trafficking committed before July 2009. Note: a new bill to increase the maximum 
sentences was submitted at the end of February 2012. The bill proposes increasing the maximum term 
of imprisonment for unqualified human trafficking from eight to twelve years. Under this proposal, the 
maximum sentence for human trafficking resulting in a person’s death would be life imprisonment or 
a term of imprisonment of 30 years (Parliamentary Documents II 2011/12, 33 185, no. 2). [This proposal 
entered into force in April 2013] (Bulletin of Acts, Order and Decrees. 2013, 84 and Bulletin of Acts, Order 
and Decrees. 2013, 108)].

18 SD: 10.7 years. On the basis of N: 1,085 (1,106 – 6 legal entities – 15 whose age was unknown).
19 SD: 10.0 years. On the basis of N: 374. 
20 The average age of the suspects ranged from 29.3 years (N: 267; SD: 9.4 years) in 2007 to 33.7 years (N: 

247; SD: 11.7 years) in 2011 that of convicted offenders from 28.0 years (N: 78; SD: 8.2 years) in 2008 to 
34.3 years (N: 79; SD: 11.8 years) in 2010.



Prosecution and trial of suspects in the Netherlands
87

The 1,106 suspects were born in 59 different countries;21 the 374 convicted offenders in 37 different 
countries22. For both for the suspects and the convicted offenders, the top five countries of birth were 
the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Hungary, Turkey and Romania – although for convicted offenders the order 
was slightly different and Turkey shared fifth place with Surinam. The largest group of suspects (37%) 
and convicted offenders (35%) were born in the Netherlands. The percentage of suspects and convicted 
offenders born in Hungary increased every year (from 1% in 2007 to 11%-12% in 2011), and the proportion 
of suspects born in Bulgaria doubled in relative terms in 2011 (14%) compared with the preceding years 
(6%-8%).

6.4.2 Top eight countries of birth of suspects by country of residence and age23

Three-quarters (75%, =828) of all suspects registered by the PPS for offences including human trafficking 
in the period 2007-2011 (N: 1,106) were from one of the top eight countries of birth, i.e. the Netherlands, 
Bulgaria, Hungary, Turkey, Romania, Morocco, Surinam and the former Netherlands Antilles. These eight 
countries are divided into three categories in this section:

21 1 in Afghanistan, 12 in Albania, 1 in Algeria, 1 in Australia, 2 in Bangladesh, 4 in Belgium, 3 in Brazil, 95 
in Bulgaria, 1 in Cameroon, 24 in China (including Hong Kong), 3 in Congo (including former Zaire), 7 
in Czechoslovakia (present-day Czech Republic and present-day Slovakia), 1 in Dahomey (present-day 
Benin), 1 in Denmark, 3 in the Dominican Republic, 1 in Egypt, 1 in Estonia, 1 in Ethiopia, 5 in France, 
27 in Germany (including the former West and East Germany), 3 in Ghana, 2 in Greece, 1 in Guyana, 1 in 
Haiti, 1 in Honduras, 82 in Hungary, 6 in India, 6 in Indonesia (including the former Dutch East Indies), 
10 in Iran, 10 in Iraq, 1 in Israel, 4 in Italy, 1 in Ivory Coast, 2 in Latvia, 2 in Lebanon, 2 in Lithuania, 
53 in Morocco, 1 in Mongolia, 406 in the Netherlands, 36 in de Netherlands Antilles (the present-day 
Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten and the current special Dutch municipalities: Saba, Sint Eustatius and

Figure 6.7 Trends in the three categories of the top eight countries of birth of suspects (2007-2011)26

The proportion of suspects born in the Netherlands ranged from 34% in 2007 to 39% in 2010 and 2011, 
representing 37% of all suspects, on average. The category Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania almost dou-
bled in relative terms in the period shown, from 14% to 27%. For Turkey, Morocco, Surinam and the 
former Netherlands Antilles, the opposite applies: the share of this category fell by half, from 23% to 11%.

The suspects born in Turkey, Morocco, Surinam and the former Netherlands Antilles often lived in the 
Netherlands (87%). Far fewer (1%) lived in their country of birth than the suspects born in Bulgaria, 
Hungary and Romania (72% of whom lived in the Netherlands and 15% in their country of birth). 

In Figure 6.8, the three categories of countries of birth are broken down by the age of the suspects at the 
time they first committed a human trafficking offence of which they were suspected. The age is divided 
into three categories (up to and including 25, 26-35 years and older than 35 years).

24 All three are countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
25 The other four countries of birth are grouped together for the purposes of creating three more or less 

comparable categories in terms of size. These four countries have little in common geographically 
(but are quite often mentioned as countries of birth of Dutch suspects in relation to the ‘loverboy 
problem’).

(42%-52%) were between 26 and 35 years of age, which was the smallest age group among suspects born 
in the Netherlands (23%). Of the suspects born in the Netherlands and in Turkey, Morocco, Surinam and

7 International data collection

7.1 Introduction

The transnational dimension of human trafficking means that data collected exclusively at national 
level is insufficient, since such data fail to provide any insight into cross-border movements by victims 
and offenders. The need to generate internationally comparable quantitative data has received a lot of 
attention. The importance of collecting harmonised international data about human trafficking has 
been underlined in various international instruments, for example. The first such call was made in The 
Hague Declaration of 19971 and it was repeated in the Action Plan Implementing the Stockholm Pro-
gramme in April 2010.2  The importance of collecting statistics about criminal offences such as human 
trafficking is also widely acknowledged by the EU member states and the European Commission (EC) 
and has been mentioned in strategy documents such as Developing a comprehensive and coherent EU Strategy 
to measure crime and criminal justice: An EU Action Plan3 and The EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in 
human beings (2012-2016).4,5

Nevertheless, the principal responsibility for producing accurate and reliable data – data that can be built 
on to produce harmonised international data – lies with the individual countries. In Figure 7.1, this is 
shown in diagrammatic form.

Figure 7.1 Pillars of international data collection initiatives

Initiatives for international data collection rely mainly on the data collected at the national level. For 
example, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating 
trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims (hereinafter the ‘EU Directive on Human Traffick-
ing) refers to the responsibility of member states to appoint national rapporteurs or establish similar 
mechanisms, one of whose tasks should be to collect and analyse data.6 Accurate and reliable data at 
the national level will foster international initiatives on data collection.

This chapter examines the issue of international data collection. In §7.1.1, we discuss a number of factors 
that complicate the process of collecting and analysing international data on human trafficking. In the 
subsequent sections, a number of international (mainly European) data-collection initiatives designed 
to overcome the problems referred to in section §7.1.1 are addressed:
– In §7.2, a number of data-collection initiatives that have already been completed are discussed. Du-

plication of such initiatives by other agencies could be avoided by building on the lessons that have 
been learned from earlier data-collection initiatives at the international level.7

– In §7.3, three current initiatives to improve data collection at the European level, in which the Bureau 
of the National Rapporteur is directly involved, are discussed.8 These are initiatives by DGHome/

6 Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council replacing Council Framework 
Decision 2002/629/JHA of the Council, 5 April 2011. The directive was published in the Official Journal 
of the European Union on 5 April 2011 (OJ 2011, L 101/1) and must be transposed into Dutch legislation 
before 6 April 2013.

7 See also EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings (2012-2016), Par. 1.

of the statistics collected by Eurostat (§7.3.2); and a national initiative by the National Commission for 
Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (NCCTHB) in Bulgaria to improve methods of data collection and 
analysis in that country.

The chapter concludes with a summary of the main findings in §7.4.

7.1.1 Reservations

As mentioned in the introduction, the data at the national level serve as the pillars for international 
data-collection initiatives. The availability and volume of data at international level depends, among 
other things, on the political and public priority given to combating human trafficking in individual 
countries, which has an influence on the degree to which data-collection initiatives are encouraged.

There are a number of further problems that can complicate the collection and analysis of international 
data.9

– Despite the internationally accepted legal definition of human trafficking laid down in the United 
Nations’ Palermo Protocol in 2000,10 there is no universally agreed international interpretation of 
what constitutes human trafficking, which could be one reason for the absence of comparable, relia-
ble and validated data about the phenomenon. Varying cultural, religious and political views could also 
have an effect on the availability of data.11 By way of illustration, in some countries moral attitudes 
dictate that prostitution is, by definition, regarded as human trafficking per se. Consequently, the data 
that are collected might be based on a wider interpretation of human trafficking than is adopted in 
the Netherlands, for example. On the other hand, some countries actually limit the definition of 
human trafficking to purely transnational situations and disregard exploitation that occurs within 
the country’s own borders. Such differences of interpretation can also mean that the statistics on 
human trafficking collected by different countries are not comparable.

– In addition to differences in the definition of human trafficking, disparities between the policies and 
institutions of different countries can affect the availability of data. For example, a country’s actual 
capacity to combat human trafficking can have an impact on the extent to which resources are made 
available to collect and analyse statistics. It is conceivable that the greater the number of people as-
signed to collecting and analysing the statistics, the larger the volume of data that will be produced 
at the national level. All of the statistics that are collected must therefore also be placed within the 
policy and institutional context in which they were collected.

– Pursuant to the EU Directive on Human Trafficking, EU member states must appoint a national rap-
porteur or establish a similar mechanism to monitor and report on their efforts to combat human 

9 For an academic reflection on the problems in national and international research into human 
trafficking see, for example, the following articles: Young 2009; Aromaa 2007; Gozdziak & Collett 2005;

trafficking.12 Practically every EU member state now has a mechanism in place to perform this task, 
usually as part of a ministry. As Figure 7.1 shows, in many countries there are numerous operational 
sources that could provide relevant data, and generally speaking, the data relating to offenders will 
be easily available or can easily be provided to monitoring mechanisms that have been established 
within a ministry. The situation is different with respect to the data about victims, which is gener-
ally sensitive and which non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are often reluctant to share with 
government agencies. Protecting the privacy of victims is an important factor in that regard, as is 
uncertainty about the security of the information.13 This is not a problem in the Netherlands; that can 
be attributed to the National Rapporteur’s independent position14, which guarantees the protection 
of sensitive data not only about victims, but also about suspects and perpetrators. This independence 
can help to ensure access to sufficient data for analysis as well as, by extension, ensuring that effective 
policy is formulated.

– A final problem that can arise in relation to the collection and comparison of international data is 
the disparity in the research methods used by different countries and their research facilities. Data 
collected at the national level might not be entirely comparable because of differences in research 
methods. For example, improved records in a particular country could lead to a higher number of 
registered victims in that country,15 which makes it difficult to compare the data with those of coun-
tries where registration has not similarly improved. Differences in research facilities can also have 
an impact on the quantity and quality of the data. The absence of the necessary software to collect 
and analyse data can prevent trends from being monitored at a national level, for example. This can 
also have an impact on the volume of data in a particular country, compared with other countries, 
and represents a problem in comparing the data between countries.

7.2 Completed initiatives in international data collection

A number of initiatives have already been taken to acquire comparative international data concerning 
human trafficking practices.16 The Bureau of the National Rapporteur was a partner in several of these 

12 See Directive 2011/EU/36, Article 19 and recital 27 in the preamble. Article 19 reads: “Member States shall 
take the necessary measures to establish national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms. The tasks 
of such mechanisms shall include the carrying out of assessments of trends in trafficking in human 
beings, the measuring of results of anti-trafficking actions, including the gathering of statistics in close 
cooperation with relevant civil society organisations active in this field, and reporting.”

13 This emerged, for example, during the international expert meeting Making prevention work: Addressing 
the root causes of human trafficking in Europe, 4-5 December 2012, Sofia, Bulgaria.

14 Inherent to this independence is the fact that no coordinating or executive tasks have been delegated 
to the National Rapporteur. See also National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human beings 2010, §1.2 
and §2.1.

15 At first glance, the figures in Chapter 3 might lead to the assumption that human trafficking is on the 
increase in the Netherlands. However, an increase in the number of victims does not necessarily imply 
that there is more human trafficking. More likely, the reporting/registration of victims has improved. 
See also Chapter 3.

projects.17 In this section, the key aspects of some of these projects are described. The European Com-
mission provided co-financing for almost all of them.18

Development of Guidelines for the Collection of Data on Trafficking in Human Beings, including Comparable 
Indicators19

This project by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior and the International Organisation for Migration 
(IOM) yielded guidelines for developing national data-collection and monitoring systems. The guideli-
nes were drawn up by a multidisciplinary team of experts, comprising representatives from various EU 
member states. They also drew up a list of indicators on which, as a minimum, data should be collected. 
The seventeen guidelines that were formulated are designed to enhance the effectiveness of national 
data-collection systems and lay the basis for a single EU system for the collection and exchange of data.

Programme for the Enhancement of Anti-trafficking Responses in South-Eastern Europe – Data Collection 
and Information Management (DCIM I) 20

The aim of this project was to improve and harmonise the collection of data on human trafficking 
in ten countries in South-East Europe.21 The result was a handbook on data collection in South-East 
Europe, comprising a list of indicators for data collection for a database on victims and a database on 
perpetrators.

Trafficking in Human Beings: Data Collection and Harmonised Information Management Systems (DCIM-EU)22

This project was a follow-up to the DCIM-I project and was aimed at setting up a transnational informa-
tion management system and formulating generally accepted and comparable indicators. Innovative 
software was developed to facilitate the collection of statistics on human trafficking by the participating 
countries.23 A handbook was also written for government agencies that collect data about victims and 
offenders.

European Delphi Survey – a Practical Exercise in Developing Indicators of Trafficking in Human Beings24

The pretext for this project was the sense that some of the key terms in the UN Palermo Protocol were 
vague and needed further elaboration. As part of the EU Action Plan 2006-2010, the European Com-
mission established an Expert Group to advance the development of harmonised definitions of human 
trafficking. Using the Delphi method,25 the experts reached consensus on four lists of operational in-
dicators of human trafficking. Each indicator is categorised as ‘weak’, ‘medium’ or ‘strong’. Assessing 
the presence or absence of a combination of these indicators determines whether a human trafficking 
situation exists. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has been promoting this indicator-based 
method of collecting data on human trafficking since 2009, when it started providing technical assis-
tance to countries in developing their own national statistics.26

Model for monitoring trafficking in human beings, sexually exploited and missing children (MONTRASEC 
project)27

The model developed in the MONTRASEC project seems to be a promising advanced system for data col-
lection at the European level.28 The system would be capable of producing internationally comparable, 
integrated and up-to-date data by automatically uploading data from existing registration systems with 
the help of advanced software. This would obviate the need for additional operational efforts at national 
level. The MONTRASEC project could provide a solution for some of the problems with international data 
collection mentioned above (§7.1). For example, the problem arising from differences in the national 
definitions of human trafficking within the EU could be overcome by breaking them down into detailed 
elements that could then be reconstructed into EU-wide definitions. There is, however, another reser-
vation that needs to be expressed in relation to the different definitions of human trafficking between 
countries: countries with a broader definition of human trafficking will have data that cannot be incor-
porated into the MONTRASEC system and countries with a stricter definition of human trafficking will 
not possess comprehensive data according to the definitions that apply within the EU. These differences 
will make it more difficult to compare the scale (but not the nature) of human trafficking between mem-
ber states. The MONTRASEC system has not yet been implemented, partly because a number of essential 
conditions cannot be met, such as the need for an independent mechanism for monitoring national data 

24 European Delphi survey on indicators of trafficking in Human Beings jointly implemented by the European Commission and 
the ILO (ILO 2008) and Operational indicators of trafficking in human beings, results from a Delphi survey implemented 
by the ILO and the European Commission (ILO, 2009). For a brief description, see National Rapporteur on 
Trafficking in Human Beings 2009, §3.2 and National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2010, 
§3.2.1.

25 This is a method that was developed in the 1950s and has since been used in social, medical and political 
science. The aim of the Delphi method is to arrive at an outcome based on consensus among a large 
group of experts from different disciplines (see also National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human 
Beings 2009, §3.2).

and protecting personal information. Some countries whose registration systems are not sufficiently 
developed would also be unable to implement the advanced system in its present form.

A common feature of these projects is that information has had to be provided by the countries them-
selves. This once again highlights the importance of enhancing data collection at the national level. It is 
not without reason that the EU Directive on Human Trafficking refers to the responsibility of the member 
states to collect quantitative data on human trafficking. Another feature of these initiatives is that many 
of them propose that data should be collected on a large number of variables, but it is not yet possible 
to collect data on all of the proposed indicators, even in the Netherlands. Experience has shown that if 
the volume of data to be collected is too great, it will, in practice, affect the quality of the data. There 
would therefore be no harm in adopting the principle of ‘less is more’ in this instance.29 Once accurate 
and reliable information about the most basic indicators of human trafficking is available, it would be 
possible to progress towards a more advanced system.

7.3 Current initiatives in international data collection

As mentioned above, there are various international initiatives aimed at enhancing data collection. 
Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt published a useful document with a lot of information about a great many 
of these initiatives in 2009.30 This publication contains an analysis of a wide range of national and in-
ternational activities carried out in the previous decade to combat human trafficking in the sex industry. 
In this section, two current initiatives designed to improve the collection and comparability of data 
on human trafficking at the international level are reviewed. In §7.3.1 a review is presented of the first 
initiative by the European Commission to enhance the collection of human trafficking statistics at the 
European level. This is a project of the Directorate-General for Home Affairs (DGHome) and Eurostat. In 
§7.3.2, there is a discussion of a project by Intervict,31 which is intended to build on the initiative of DG-
Home/Eurostat. In §7.3.3, a project at national level in Bulgaria to improve data collection and analysis 
is described. The Bureau of the National Rapporteur is directly involved in each of these initiatives.32

7.3.1 DGHome/Eurostat

In response to the European Commission’s five-year plan to develop a comprehensive and coherent EU 
strategy to measure crime and criminal justice,33 the DGHome Expert Group on Policy Needs for Data on 
Crime and Criminal Justice launched a programme for the collection of data on human trafficking, with

31 Invervict is an international, multidisciplinary research institute at the University of Tilburg conducting 

research into security issues in post-conflict situations and legal and psycho-social aspects of 
victimisation in international offences in a multidisciplinary framework (www.tilburguniversity.edu/
research/institutes-and-research-groups/intervict/).

32 In addition to these projects, the Bureau of the National Rapporteur also provides data to the Group 
of Experts on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA), the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime (UNODC) and the US Department of State for the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.

the involvement of Eurostat to collect crime statistics. The aim of the initiative is to provide an overview of 
comparable data and to identify trends at the national and EU level. It is the first project undertaken by the 
European Commission in relation to the collection of international data concerning human trafficking.34

DGHome and Eurostat will shortly publish a selection of the most reliable and robust data that they col-
lected from each member state in the period 2008-2010.35 To guarantee the availability and quality of 
the data, the European Commission formulated a short list of general indicators. Based on the results 
of this first data collection initiative by DGHome/Eurostat, the Commission and the member states will 
collaborate in collecting comparable and reliable data for the years 2011 and 2012.36

Initial results from the statistics compiled by DGHome and Eurostat, as mentioned in the EU Strategy 
towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings (2012-2016), are presented below.37,38 Figure 7.2 
shows the proportion of male and female victims as well as the proportion of underage victims.

trafficking in human beings (2012-2016), par. 1.

36 DGHome/Eurostat will continue collecting statistics on human trafficking in the period 2011-2015. 
This is in response to the EU’s new five-year plan Measuring Crime in the EU: Statistics Action Plan 2011-2015 
(COM/2011/0713 def.). See also EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings 
(2012-2016), par. 2.5.

37 On possible reservations about these quantitative data, see the forthcoming report by DGHome/
Eurostat on the human trafficking statistics collected at EU level. The percentages in that report may 
differ from the percentages mentioned in this report. Reference is also made to that report for the 
correct use of the human trafficking statistics collected at EU level.

38 Because various countries report identified and/or probable victims to Eurostat, the figures presented 
in §7.3.1 represent an aggregate of identified and probable victims.

Figure 7.2 Gender and age of identified and possible victims in EU member states (2008-2010)39

As Figure 7.2 shows, 21% of the registered identified and probable victims were male, 3% of whom were 
minors. The proportion of registered female victims was far larger (79%), and 12% of them were minors. 
This corresponds with the records of possible victims in the Netherlands registered by the Coordination 
Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha), although the ratio of male to female victims is slightly dif-
ferent in the Netherlands: 89% female and 11% male.40

Most member states reported that the majority of the victims came from EU member states such as 
Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary. Victims from outside the EU came primarily from Nigeria, Vi-
etnam, Ukraine, Russia and China.41 According to the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking 
in human beings (2012-2016), the causes of human trafficking include vulnerability to poverty, lack of 
democracy, gender inequality and violence against women, conflict and post-conflict situations, lack of 
social integration, lack of opportunities and employment, lack of access to education, and discrimina-
tion.42 For Dutch victims in the Netherlands, there are also other factors that make people vulnerable 
to exploitation, such as having run away from a juvenile care facility, having a drug addiction or reduced 
mental capacity.43

39 The statistics collected by Eurostat provide an overview of the data received for the period 2008-2010 
from the 27 member states, 21 of which were able to provide gender-specific information for that 
period. The data in Figure 7.2 are taken from the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in 
human beings (2012-2016), p. 3, which only gives percentages.

40 In the period 2008-2010 2,727 possible victims were reported to CoMensha. 89% (=2,428) were female 
and 11% (=297) were male (Source: CoMensha database). See also Chapter 3.

The following figure shows the sectors in which identified or probable victims were exploited in the EU 
member states in 2008 and in 2010.

Figure 7.3 Sectors in which victims were exploited in EU member states (2008 and 2010)44

The figure above shows that the vast majority of the known (possible) victims in the EU member states 
(70% in 2008 and 76% in 2010) were exploited in the sex industry. Almost a quarter of cases in 2008 
involved labour exploitation (24%), but this proportion declined to 14% in 2010.45 The remainder fall 
into categories such as ‘forced begging’ and ‘domestic servitude’ or are unknown. If this is compared 
with the victims reported to CoMensha, it can be seen that the proportion of victims in cases of sexual 
exploitation also increased significantly in the Netherlands (from 57% in 2008 to 75% in 2010.46 In con-
trast to the decline in the proportion of victims of labour exploitation at the EU level, the proportion 
of victims exploited in sectors other than the sex industry actually increased in the Netherlands47 (from 
6% in 2008 to 13% in 2010).48 

44 The statistics collected by Eurostat provide an overview of the data from all 27 member states for the 
period 2008-2010. The data in Figure 7.3 are from the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking 
in human beings (2012-2016), pp. 2-3, which only reports percentages.

45 This is exclusive of forced begging and domestic servitude (EU Strategy towards the eradication of 
trafficking in human beings (2012-2016), pp. 2-3).

46 In 2008 826 possible victims were reported to CoMensha and 57% (=473) was sexually exploited. In 2010 
993 possible victims were reported to CoMensha and 75% (=749) was sexually exploited. The increases 
are partially due to improvements in CoMensha’s records. See also Chapter 3 (Source: CoMensha 
database).

47 This is inclusive of ‘domestic servitude’.
48 In 2008 826 possible victims were reported to CoMensha and 6% (=52) was exploited outside the sex 

industry. In 2010 993 possible victims were reported to CoMensha and 20% (=128) were exploited outside 
the sex industry. The increases can be partially explained by the fact that other forms of exploitation 
were criminalized later. The increases are also partially due to improvements in CoMensha’s records.

International data collection
101

In addition to information about victims, Eurostat also collects statistics on suspects and persons who 
have been prosecuted and convicted at the EU level. To illustrate, a provisional database compiled by 
DGHome/Eurostat shows that as regards the number of Dutch suspects in other countries and Dutch 
nationals who were prosecuted in other countries49 in the period 2008-2010, there were dozens in Bel-
gium and, in exceptional cases, also in Finland, Italy, Germany and Austria.50

As with every data-collection initiative, the extent to which the problems relating to the collection and 
analysis of international data on human trafficking have been resolved will have to be constantly moni-
tored. While the European Commission seems to have made some progress in that respect, the results in 
the forthcoming report from DGHome/Eurostat will give a clearer impression of the extent to which the 
data on human trafficking collected at EU level are comparable and can be used to formulate national 
and international policies on human trafficking.51 The next section explains how Intervict is trying to 
build on the results produced by DGHome/Eurostat.

7.3.2 Intervict
Intervict’s intention is to provide more depth to the data-collection initiative of DGHome and Eurostat.52 
In the project Tools for the validation and utilisation of EU statistics on human trafficking (TRAFSTAT), which was 
co-financed by the EU, the methodology of the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics53 was 
applied to the statistics collected by DGHome/Eurostat.54

The aim of the methodology in the European Sourcebook is to present comparable information about 
statistics on crime and criminal justice in Europe using a system of peer review to validate national sta-
tistical data. The reason for this was because national definitions are often not similar. The methodology 
is different to that of DGHome/Eurostat, which is based on information delivered by national sources 
that had been asked to follow standard definitions.55

The aim of TRAFSTAT is to enhance the comparability of European statistics on human trafficking by using a 
system of validation by experts from the national rapporteurs (hereinafter “correspondents”).56 The project 
will further the implementation of the EU Directive on Human Trafficking, which states that the EU should 
continue to develop its methodologies and data-collection methods to produce comparable statistics.57 In-
tervict intends to investigate the extent to which the EU statistics on human trafficking are comparable and

50 Received from DGHome/Eurostat in July 2012. It is very likely that the EU member states will make 

changes or additions to the data. For the correct use of the human trafficking statistics collected at EU 
level, reference is therefore made to the forthcoming report of DGHome/Eurostat.

51 At the time of writing, the report of DGHome/Eurostat had not yet been published.

can be used to formulate policies at the EU level. Intervict’s initiative differs from that of DGHome/Eurostat in 
that Intervict does not collect its own statistics, but analyses the significance of the statistics already collected 
by Eurostat. For example, in the data collected by DGHome/Eurostat, the ‘identified’ victims are victims who 
have been identified by the police. In a number of countries, however, the police force is not the only authority 
that identifies victims. In Austria, for example, victims are identified by the police and an NGO, with the result 
that both authorities keep records of victims. Because they do not share their information, duplication in the 
data supplied to Eurostat is inevitable.58 Once the results of the projects of DGHome/Eurostat and Intervict 
are published, it will become clearer how these initiatives complement one another.

There are two stages to the TRAFSTAT project. First, detailed operational definitions of the requested 
statistics will be drafted on the basis of a questionnaire in which the correspondents can explain to what 
extent the statistics on human trafficking for Eurostat correspond with the established standards. They 
will also be asked for feedback on the policy-related and institutional context in which the statistics have 
to be interpreted. This first phase will produce three results: a set of operational standard definitions, 
a report on the initial statistics produced by DGHome/Eurostat for all the member states for the period 
2008-2010, and recommendations for changes to or refinement of the European Commission’s guide-
lines. In the second stage, Intervict will draw up quantitative indicators, based on the EU statistics, which 
could provide guidelines for monitoring national and EU policies on human trafficking. Intervict will 
also make proposals for the responsible use of the statistics in formulating policies on human traffick-
ing at the EU level. These proposals could lead to an international standard for the use of such statistics.

7.3.3 National initiative: Bulgaria
In August 2012, the National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (NCCTHB)59 in 
Bulgaria launched a data-collection and analysis project: Improvement of National Anti-traffic Policy through 
Transfer of Know-How, Experience and Good Practices.60 The aim of the project is to improve efforts to combat 
human trafficking in Bulgaria, with the emphasis on developing a methodology for data collection and 
analysis. The Bureau of the National Rapporteur has served as a consultant on the monitoring of human 
trafficking policies and the collection and analysis of data. On completion of the project, the intention 
is that three reports will be published: (1) a comparative analysis of the monitoring of human trafficking

59 The NCCTHB was established and its tasks laid down in the Combating trafficking in human beings Act 

(Republic of Bulgaria, Council of Ministers – National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human 
Beings, State Gazette 46/20.05.2003, amended SG 86/28.10.2005, effective 29.04.2006, supplemented, 
SG No. 33/28.03.2008, amended, SG No. 74/15.09.2009, effective 15.09.2009). See Article 4 for the 
establishment of the National Commission and Article 7 for the description of the tasks of the NCCTHB, 
which include promoting “the research, analysis and statistical reporting of human trafficking data” 
(Article 7 (4)).

and the processing of statistical data; (2) a methodology for data collection and analysis in Bulgaria; and 
(3) a report on the monitoring and analysis of current human trafficking policy in Bulgaria.61

NCCTHB has adopted the DCIM I system for a victim-oriented database.62 Nevertheless, NCCTHB faces 
a number of obstacles in data collection because of a lack of data and the failure of authorities to share 
data at the operational level.63 With the current project, NCCTHB hopes to improve data collection and 
analysis by sharing best practices with the Bureau of the National Rapporteur in order to gain an insight 
into the scale and nature of human trafficking in Bulgaria. Although the system from the International 
Centre for Migration Policy Development (IMCPD) that it is using contains both a victim database and 
offender database, in principle NCCTHB wants to focus mainly on the collection of data about victims.64

Besides generating information about the nature and scale of human trafficking at the national level in 
Bulgaria, on the basis of the data collected and analysed, the NCCTHB’s project could contribute in two 
ways to international efforts to combat human trafficking. First, the results of the collection and analysis 
of data about victims and offenders from Bulgaria could also be relevant for the Netherlands in view of 
the growing number of Bulgarian victims of human trafficking and offenders65 in the Netherlands since 
2008. Table 7.1 shows the number of Bulgarian victims in the Netherlands registered by CoMensha. The 
collaboration between the National Commission in Bulgaria and the Bureau of the National Rapporteur 
also furthers the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings (2012-2016), which 
refers to the need for cooperation between the countries of origin, the countries of transit and the 
countries of destination. 66

A second way in which the project of the National Commission in Bulgaria can contribute to international 
efforts to combat human trafficking is connected with the responsibility of each individual state to col-
lect and analyse data about human trafficking. As Figure 7.1 shows, in principle, statistics collected at the 
international level are based on data collected at the national level. The reliability and validity of the results 
of international initiatives, such as those of DGHome/Eurostat and Intervict,67 therefore depend greatly 
on the data collected at the national level and the policy-related, institutional or methodological context 
of the data collection. Given the wide range of mechanisms that exist at the European level alone, the 
European Commission stresses the importance of effective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation 
in order to prevent duplication. For example, in the EU Strategy, the member states are urged to arrange 
effective monitoring of human trafficking policy at the national level (policy that is based on data on human 
trafficking).68 Bulgaria seems to be making progress in that direction.

7.4 Summary

In this chapter, we have discussed a selection of international data-collection initiatives that have been 
undertaken in the past decade.69 The Bureau of the National Rapporteur has been involved as a partner in 
a number of these projects. Despite these initiatives, there are still no reliable and comparable statistics 
on human trafficking in the EU. This is due, for example, to discrepancies in the definitions adopted at the 
national level, differences in policies and institutions and political and social priorities and differences in 
the methodologies used and the research facilities available for collection and analysis of data.

Nevertheless, such initiatives remain essential to compile harmonised international data in order to 
support effective international efforts to combat human trafficking. The results of the on-going data-
collection initiatives by DGHome/Eurostat and Intervict described in this chapter could represent progress 
towards accomplishing this goal.

8  Conclusions and recommendations: no 
effective policies without proper registration 

Human trafficking is a serious, frequently transnational, problem that is usually hidden, but effective policies 
cannot be implemented in the dark. To address the problem of human trafficking, we have to turn on the 
light: Where does human trafficking occur? How large is the problem? What form does it take?

The Coordination Centre for Human Trafficking (CoMensha) wants to know whether all known victims 
are actually registered. And do the characteristics of registered victims correspond with those of the prob-
able population? The police want to know where they should be looking for human traffickers. Where 
do offenders usually put their victims to work? The Minister of Security and Justice wants to know how 
great the chance is of a human trafficker actually being caught. How many human traffickers are there 
in the Netherlands?

But sometimes it is even difficult to see who is fighting the problem. Various agencies are engaged with 
different aspects of human trafficking, but ultimately have to produce a joint solution. For effective 
coordination, it is important that every agency knows what it is doing and what the other agencies are 
doing. That is not necessarily the case.

This report has one key message:

To tackle human trafficking effectively, it must be made visible. Human trafficking that is hid-
den must be revealed – and once revealed, it must be better registered.

Since 2000, the National Rapporteur has been conducting research into the nature and scale of human 
trafficking in the Netherlands. Slowly but surely, successive reports have shed a little more light on the 
subject. This report lifts the veil a little further: with an analysis of quantitative data on human traf-
ficking, from the registration of victims to the trial of offenders, it gives an impression of victims and 
offenders and of policy.

8.1 Conclusions: what stands out?

This report describes human trafficking on the basis of estimates of the unknown component of the 
problem (the ‘dark number’) (Chapter 2), the registration of victims by CoMensha (Chapter 3), access to 
the B9 scheme for non-Dutch victims (Chapter 4), investigations by the police (Chapter 5), the handling 



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
108

of human trafficking cases by the public prosecution service (PPS) and the judiciary (Chapter 6) and 
international data-collection initiatives (Chapter 7). Fortunately, as the size of this report illustrates, a 
lot of good information is already registered.

8.1.1 Unknown human trafficking 
For the first time in a report by the National Rapporteur, there is a critical analysis of some of the es-
timates of the scale of human trafficking, both national and international. These estimates are very 
important: the vast majority of victims/perpetrators/investigations referred to in this report relate to 
cases of sexual exploitation and only a minority to exploitation in sectors other than the sex industry 
(‘other forms of exploitation’). But does this mean that there are far more victims of sexual exploitation 
in the Netherlands than are exploited outside the sex industry? That is unknown. The registered human 
trafficking cannot be regarded as representative of all human trafficking. Further research into the size 
and nature of the so-called ‘dark number’ is needed. 

But, as shown in Chapter 2, there are number of problems with existing estimates that make them unreli-
able. In the Crime Projection Analysis (CBA) of sexual exploitation in 2012, for example, it was assumed, 
without further substantiation, that a constant share of 5% of human trafficking is known to the police. 

8.1.2 Victims 
Chapter 3 contains data on the registration of victims by CoMensha, and Chapter 4, information on 
the registration of victims by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) in the context of B9 
applications.

A number of points stand out in CoMensha’s figures: the number of reported victims of human traffick-
ing rose sharply between 2007 and 2011 (from 716 to 1,222), and the proportion of male victims actually 
trebled (from 7% to 19%). One aspect that has remained constant is that the largest group of victims (39%) 
is young: between 18 and 23 years of age. While a third of all registered victims has Dutch nationality, the 
majority of registered underage victims are Dutch, but not all underage victims are reported to CoMen-
sha (see recommendations). A growing proportion of the victims registered with CoMensha is exploited 
outside the sex industry (up from 6% in 2007 to 20% in 2011). The characteristics of victims of sexual and 
other forms of exploitation differ in a number of important respects. Victims of sexual exploitation are 
more often female, they are younger, they come more often from Africa and less frequently from Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe. In addition, the willingness to report the offence among this group of victims 
is slightly higher than among victims of other forms of exploitation, although this is slightly less true 
among victims with Dutch nationality.

Chapter 4 analyses the B9 regulation. Victims of human trafficking who cooperate with an investigation 
are eligible for a B9 residence permit for the duration of the investigation. The B9 permit not only grants 
temporary residence status for the victim, but is also an important instrument for an investigation since 
it means that victims and witnesses remain available to the police and the PPS. The data in Chapter 4 
provide information about all the victims who have taken advantage of the reflection period and/or have 
made a B9 application. Among this group, 38% requested a B9 residence permit without first availing 
of the reflection period, while 40% used the reflection period and then applied for a B9 permit. Finally, 
22% used the reflection period but ultimately did not apply for a B9 permit. While this might indicate 
that these victims did not cooperate with a police investigation, it is also possible that they did cooper-
ate but then returned to their country of origin or were still awaiting another immigration procedure.



Conclusions and recommendations: no effective policies without proper registration
109

The number of B9 permits granted between 2007 and 2011 almost trebled. The proportion of Bulgar-
ian and Romanian victims that were granted a B9 residence permit declined in the period 2007-2011, 
although CoMensha did not report a similar decline in the number of victims from those countries. 
Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union (EU) in 2007, and therefore the nationals of those 
countries can live legally in the Netherlands. However, the B9 residence permit entitles the recipient to 
more than just temporary residence: it also provides access to facilities that could assist victims of human 
trafficking. The proportion of B9 residence permits granted to victims from Poland and Hungary has not 
in fact declined since those countries joined the EU in 2004.

In the period 2009-2011, 31 applications for B9 permits (3%) were denied. One of the grounds on which 
an application can be rejected is a person’s criminal antecedents, such as a record for shoplifting. How-
ever, a B9 application should, in principle, be granted to every victim of human trafficking who cooper-
ates with the police, regardless of his or her criminal antecedents. A B9 permit only grants temporary 
residence, after all, and is important not only for the victim but also to enable the police and the PPS to 
investigate and prosecute the offence of human trafficking.

8.1.3 Offenders
Chapters 5 (investigation) and 6 (prosecution and trial) give an impression of the characteristics of sus-
pected offenders, as registered by the police and the PPS.

Offenders are generally male (80%), around 30 years of age on average (only occasionally are they minors 
or older than 50) and born in the Netherlands (37%), Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania (21%) or Turkey, 
Morocco, Surinam or the former Netherlands Antilles (17%). Offenders from Africa (with the exception 
of Morocco) appear less frequently in the statistics on prosecutions, which is noteworthy given the fact 
that offenders and victims often come from the same region and Africa is the main region of origin of 
registered victims of sexual exploitation.

No two human trafficking investigations are the same. Chapter 5 contains a study of all 55 investigations 
completed by the police and sent to the PPS in 2009. These investigations could be broken down into 
three types of human trafficking: domestic small-scale sexual exploitation, European sexual exploita-
tion and international large-scale exploitation outside the sex industry. In the investigations involving 
domestic small-scale sexual exploitation (N: 27), the victims were mainly from the Netherlands and the 
offenders were generally from the Netherlands or from Turkey, Morocco, Surinam or the former Nether-
lands Antilles. The number of victims and offenders in each investigation was small and the exploitation 
was almost exclusively sexual in nature. The second type (N: 22) encompassed only sexual exploitation 
and involved a slightly larger number of victims and offenders who came mainly from Central and East-
ern Europe. The third type (N: 6) mainly involved other forms of exploitation. These were larger investi-
gations, the victims were generally from Asia, and the offenders were from Asia and the Netherlands. It 
is worth noting that the recruitment of victims by feigning a loving relationship tends to be connected 
with domestic small-scale sexual exploitation, but it is not confined to that type of case. However, if the 
police are confronted with an Asian victim of exploitation outside the sex industry, they might be more 
inclined to start a large-scale investigation than they would if they were confronted with a Dutch victim 
of sexual exploitation.

Chapter 5 also answers the following question: are different roles (recruiters, transporters, pimps, body-
guards, sex business operators and facilitators) in the human trafficking process performed by different 



Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
110

types of offenders? The answer is yes. Pimps, for example, are more likely to have criminal antecedents 
and to be male, sex business operators are generally older while bodyguards are younger, and recruiters 
are less often from Asia, although that last point could also merely imply that Asian recruiters are not 
well known to the police.

Chapter 6 contains an analysis of cases registered by the PPS. The maximum sentence for human trafficking 
was increased in 2009, which expanded the scope for the application of pre-trial detention. Nevertheless, 
that instrument was not used more often. A striking statistic is that 22% of the cases brought by the PPS 
ended with an unconditional decision not to prosecute, with one-fifth of those cases involving a policy 
waiver. Of the suspects who were charged, only just over half were convicted, and the average length of 
the unconditional part of the custodial sentences imposed was shorter than previously. But the recent 
sharp increase in the average length of custodial sentences (749.1 days in 2011) seems to suggest that, in 
practice, the sentences imposed by the courts reflect the increase in the maximum sentences prescribed 
by law since July 2009, with which the legislature wanted to emphasise the serious nature of the offence 
of human trafficking.

Appeals were filed by the PPS in 28% of the cases in 2010, twice as many as in 2007. In that context, it is 
noteworthy that the total number of human trafficking cases heard on appeal (114) in the period 2007-
2011 is far smaller than the number of the human trafficking cases dealt with in first instance and heard 
on appeal (312). Although these cases do not constitute a cohort, a difference of around 200 cases can 
be described as remarkable.

8.1.4 International aspects

Human trafficking is not just a national problem. For example, only a minority (40%) of the registered 
suspects of human trafficking in the Netherlands also come from the Netherlands. Cooperation between 
countries is therefore essential if the problem is to be tackled effectively. And that includes cooperation 
in collecting data in order to chart the scale of transnational human trafficking.

In Chapter 7, some international initiatives to enhance data collection are discussed. It is not always 
clear what the purpose of these initiatives is. International data-collection initiatives are only relevant 
if they provide insight into something that cannot be understood at the national level; the movements 
of suspects and victims between countries of origin, transit and destination, for example.

The collection of internationally comparable data is complicated by differences between countries in 
their definitions of human trafficking, in their policies and in their research methods and research 
facilities. Nevertheless, harmonised international data are badly needed. A first step could be taken by 
collecting data on the most basic indicators. After all, in practice, collecting too much information about 
human trafficking could also affect the quality of the data. After positive evaluations of the results of the 
initial dataset, it could possibly be expanded with additional indicators for the purposes of the preven-
tion and suppression of human trafficking at the international level.



Conclusions and recommendations: no effective policies without proper registration
111

8.2 Recommendations: What is lacking?

The summary above shows that there is already a lot of information available about the visible face 
of human trafficking. That is good news: the National Rapporteur has pointed out on previous occa-
sions that combating human trafficking effectively calls for accurate information and, therefore, proper 
registration.

There is still room for improvement, however. The key message of this report is therefore:

To tackle human trafficking effectively, it must be made visible. Human trafficking that is hid-
den must be revealed – and once revealed, it must be better registered.

Although this report provides a reasonably detailed portrait on the basis of available data, it also reveals 
a number of important gaps. That observation leads to some specific recommendations, all of them 
derived from the key message.

To ascertain the true scale of human trafficking, the dark number has to be estimated accurately. Reliable 
estimates are important for formulating policy in relation to police investigations, for example, but at 
the moment there are no reliable estimates. Such estimates are also difficult to produce and, apart from 
extensive statistical expertise, require data that are not available at the moment; for example a national 
survey that measures the actual number of victims and perpetrators of human trafficking. In addition, 
it is important to have the most accurate information possible about the nature of the portion that is 
already registered and visible, since that affects the reliability of the estimate.

Recommendation 1: The government should endeavour to produce accurate estimates of the 
scale of human trafficking. In addition to complete and reliable data collection, this calls for 
statistical expertise.

In the data from CoMensha (Chapter 3), the proportion of underage victims seems relatively small. 
However, this category is probably under-reported. Many underage victims who do not have Dutch na-
tionality are known to NIDOS, which does not report to CoMensha. The Youth Care Agency also does not 
always notify CoMensha about victims. The figures from CoMensha therefore give an overly optimistic 
impression of the number of possible underage victims. Even agencies that are required to report victims 
to CoMensha (the police, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee and the Inspectorate of the Ministry of 
Social Affairs and Employment) do not always appear to comply with that obligation. There are therefore 
probably victims of human trafficking who are known but are not reported to CoMensha. Furthermore, 
the information provided to CoMensha is not always complete.

Recommendation 2: All victims known to agencies must be reported to CoMensha. Agencies 
with a duty to report must comply consistently with their obligation; agencies that do not have 
such a duty should nevertheless report all victims known to them.

This recommendation was made previously in the Seventh report (recommendation 42), but deserves 
to be repeated here. 

http://www.dutchrapporteur.nl/reports/seventh/


Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
112

Underage victims are also not always registered as minors, often because they are adults by the time they 
are registered with CoMensha. Without information about their age when they first became victims, it is 
impossible to build up a complete picture of the underage victims of human trafficking.

Recommendation 3: Because it is not known how old persons are when they become victims, 
the proportion of underage victims may be underestimated. CoMensha should therefore also 
register the age of victims at the time they first became victims.

In the interests of police investigations, it is important to know which types of victims are more likely to 
cooperate with an investigation. For example, is there a difference between victims of sexual and other 
forms of exploitation in that regard? Availing of the B9 regulation could be an indication of this, since 
cooperation with an investigation is a requirement for being granted a B9 residence permit. The IND, 
however, does not register whether an applicant is a victim of sexual or another form of exploitation. 
The B9 permit not only gives the victim the right to temporary residence, but is also an instrument in the 
investigation and prosecution of offenders. It is therefore important to know whether the B9 regulation 
is effective and whether it is equally effective for different types of exploitation.

Chapter 5 shows that police investigations relating to sexual exploitation are often smaller in scale than 
investigations concerning other forms of exploitation, and the characteristics of offenders and victims 
(particularly the regions of origin) are different. Does this also have implications for prosecution and 
trial? That is unknown: even the PPS does not register whether a case is related to sexual or other forms 
of exploitation. It is, in fact, difficult to do so, since the text of the relevant article of the Dutch Criminal 
Code makes it impossible to make a distinction between them on the grounds of the sections and sub-
sections. The new GPS registration system, however, creates a possibility.

Recommendation 4: Parties throughout the chain should register whether a human trafficking 
case involves sexual exploitation or exploitation in other economic sectors (‘other forms of 
exploitation’) or whether it is for the purpose of organ removal. The IND and the PPS, in any 
case, do not currently do so.

As previously recommended by the National Rapporteur, criminal antecedents should not, in principle, 
be a ground for rejecting a B9 application, since the interests of investigation and prosecution and of 
protecting the victim should prevail. It is, after all, a temporary residence permit, which serves a dual 
purpose. The situation could be different with regard to the permit on the grounds of the B16 regulation. 
Not enough is known about the process after a B9 residence permit has been granted. The IND does not 
keep a record of the number of victims with a B9 permit that then submit a B16 application. This makes 
it difficult to monitor how many B9 residence permits ultimately lead to continued residence.

Recommendation 5: The IND should keep records in such a way that all victims of human traf-
ficking can be monitored during immigration law procedures.

In Chapter 5, only the 55 completed police investigations that were surveyed manually were discussed. 
This is because the police records do not provide reliable data on human trafficking: suspects of the 
various human trafficking offences and people smuggling are often registered under the same code.



Conclusions and recommendations: no effective policies without proper registration
113

Recommendation 6: The police should make a distinction between human trafficking and peo-
ple smuggling in their records.

Chapter 7 discusses current initiatives to enhance international data collection. As mentioned there, it 
is very important, but also very difficult, to compile uniform international data. The national data on 
human trafficking are essential pillars for international data-collection initiatives. Nevertheless, most 
countries do not have reliable data on human trafficking at the national level, which impairs the genera-
tion of harmonised international data.

The EU Directive on Human Trafficking refers member states to their responsibility to appoint national 
rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms, part of whose task is to collect and analyse data at the national 
level. The EU is investing in projects designed to improve data collection and analysis at the national 
level, such as the project of the National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (NC-
CTHB) in Bulgaria, a project in which the Bureau of the National Rapporteur is a partner. International 
cooperation is essential in this respect.

Given the many international data-collection initiatives, a recommendation is to build on existing ini-
tiatives. International cooperation could also prevent duplication of initiatives (see also National Rap-
porteur on Trafficking in Human Beings 2004, recommendation 53). Collaboration at an international 
level can also enhance the quantity and quality of data on human trafficking, by enabling countries to 
share best practices, for example.

Recommendation 7: The Dutch government should continue to press for international coo-
peration, in the interests of improving data collection and analysis at both the national and 
international level.

To be continued …
The results of quantitative studies often provide a searchlight, which scans the environment and reveals 
its topography. If something stands out, it is advisable to zoom in and investigate it more closely. The 
same applies here. The statistical portrait of registered human trafficking in the Netherlands presented 
in this report naturally raises new qualitative issues. This report therefore ends with a list of possible 
ingredients for future reports by the National Rapporteur. The following striking findings in this report 
deserve further research:
– Chapter 2 shows the importance of conducting a national survey of victims of human trafficking. No 

such study has ever been made in the Netherlands. Is it possible?
– The data in Chapter 3 suggest systematic under-reporting of underage victims from the Netherlands 

and other countries to CoMensha. How would the situation appear if these victims were included?
– In addition to research into B9 residence permits, in this report the Bureau of the National Rappor-

teur was, for the first time, able to investigate the number of victims who had taken advantage of 
the reflection period. A notable finding is that a fifth of the victims who use the reflection period do 
not ultimately apply for a B9 permit. Why not?

– Although the increase in the maximum sentences for the offence of human trafficking has expanded 
the scope for the application of pre-trial detention, there was no increase in its application in the 
period 2007-2011. Why not?

Trafficking in Human Beings: VisiBle and inVisiBle
114

– In one-fifth of the human trafficking cases that resulted in unconditional decisions by the PPS not to 
prosecute, the decision was based on a policy waiver. That is a very high percentage. On what grounds 
does the PPS decide on a policy waiver?

– Willingness to report offences varies from one group of victims to another. What are the reasons?
– Suspects born in Africa (with the exception of Morocco) appear relatively infrequently in the figures 

for prosecutions, which is striking because offenders and victims are often from the same region and 
Africa is the main region of origin of registered victims of sexual exploitation. What is the explana-
tion for this?

Human trafficking is a multifaceted and largely invisible problem. In this report, we have analysed vari-
ous aspects of the problem using statistics. These statistics are very important for guiding further re-
search and for evaluating and, if necessary, adjusting policies. It is therefore essential that the relevant 
agencies register the relevant information as accurately and completely as possible. In that way, we can 
shed a little more light on hidden face of human trafficking.
